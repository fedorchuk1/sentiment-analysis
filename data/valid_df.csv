i was shocked by the ridiculously unbelievable plot of tigerland . it was a liberal  s fantasy of how the military should be . the dialogue was difficult to swallow along with the silly things colin farrell  s character was allowed to get away with by his superior officers .  br    br   i kept thinking   hey  there  s a reason why boot camp is tough . it  s supposed to condition soldiers for battle and turn them into one cohesive unit . there  s no room for cocky attitudes and men who won  t follow orders .  i was rooting for bozz to get his butt kicked because he was such a danger to his fellow soldiers . i would not want to fight alongside someone like him in war because he was more concerned with people  s feelings than with doing what was necessary to protect his unit .  br    br      br    br    ,0
a group of model  caliber san francisco women who have been friends since elementary school are suddenly being threatened and attacked by someone sending them bizarre valentine  s day cards . who is the killer and why is the killer after them   br    br   my rating will often change on subsequent viewings of a film   sometimes slightly up  sometimes slightly down . however  i can  t remember another film where my rating has changed as drastically as it has for valentine . the first time i watched it  upon its theatrical release  i thought it was pretty awful   i gave it a  out of    the equivalent of an  f  letter grade . watching it for a second time last night  i can  t remember what the heck i didn  t like about it . i can only assume that maybe i was really in the wrong mood to watch it  or maybe i just didn  t get it . in any event  i loved it this time  giving it a  out of    or an  a  .  br    br   it might sound ridiculous saying i didn  t get a film like this  but there is something to get . valentine is almost a comedy  horror . director jamie blanks  who was also responsible for      s urban legend  takes the stereotypical teen horror formula that became so popular in the late     s in the wake of scream       and pushes most of the elements up a notch  making valentine intentionally cheesy  campy almost to the point of absurdity  where absurdism is a positive stylistic term  . on top of that  he gives us a film imbued with humorous commentary on romantic relationships . the humor is unusual in that it has the same exaggeratedly campy tone as the teen horror aspects . most of the situations in the film  and the modus operandi of the villain  humorous or not  are tied in to the valentine  s day theme .  br    br   many viewers will likely subtract points from the film for its various clich  rooted but implausible scenarios and plot developments . however  in light of the above  the film is intentionally clichd  implausible and ludicrous . it  s as if blanks is attempting  and mostly succeeding  to transcend the typical teen slasher by mocking  spoofing the conventions of the genre while also satirizing eros . that  s the attraction to the irony of basing a horror film on valentine  s day . it  s an incongruity that is cleverly woven throughout the film  and that is itself at the heart of the slasher genre  making it prime fodder for valentine  s extravagant lampooning . scream had a similar aim with its horror material  but the twist there was that the film was  self  aware  . valentine  s day is intentionally not self  aware the viewer has to rely on contextual clues for satire . lest some think i  m  reading too much  into the film  it  s worthwhile to note that blanks said in interviews that he  didn  t want to just do another slasher film after urban legend  and producer dylan sellers said he wanted to do something  more adult  .  br    br   other viewers may dislike the fact that valentine  s day differs so much from its putative source material  the novel of the same name by tom savage . the novel  s characters  setting and plot are very different from the film . sellers has said   while it was a fine book  i didn  t think it was the right story for a film  . so instead the novel  which is much dryer and more serious in tone  was used as a launching pad  a motif to create variations on for a horror  thriller story centered on valentine  s day . while those facts won  t help purists familiar with the book like the film  it  s helpful to understand why the film has its divergent plot and attitude . it  s probably better to look at the film as an independent entity with a similar theme .  br    br   blanks  direction is impeccable visually . valentine  s day has a lush look throughout  with complex  deep colors  interesting sets  and good staging . blanks is admirable for keeping his villain and attack scenes not too dark  with clearly conveyed action . he also directs his actors with aplomb  catalyzing often slyly humorous performances . david boreanaz  as adam carr  is involved in many of the funniest moments .  br    br   while valentine  s day is no masterpiece  it  s a very good horror  thriller film that seems strongly prone to misconceptions . if you watch it expecting something more tongue  in  cheek you may find yourself appreciating it a lot more .  ,1
i  ve seen this film criticized with the statement   if you can get past the moralizing . . .  that misses the point . moralizing is in the conscience of the beholder  as it were . this is a decent film with a standard murder mystery  but with a distinct twist that surfaces midway through . the resolution leaves the viewer wondering   what would i have done in this position   and i have to believe that  s exactly what the filmmaker intended . to that end  and to the end of entertaining the audience  the film succeeds . i also like the way that the violence is never on stage  but just off camera . we know what has just happened it  s just not served up in front of us  then rubbed in our faces  as it would be today with contemporary blood and gore dressing . besides  the violence is not the point . the point is the protagonist  s moral dilemma  which is cleverly  albeit disturbingly  resolved .  ,1
intelligent  stylish  and compelling thriller from the great brian de palma is a modern classic that firmly ranks among his best films   br    br   when troubled housewife is brutally murdered by a bizarre stranger  the victim  s son joins with a prostitute to uncover the killer .  br    br   dressed to kill left a strong impression upon the audiences of its day and for good reason . de palma creates a wonderfully dramatic story that begins with an intriguing setup and builds into a harrowing mystery full of strong suspense . the finale and conclusion are especially  nightmarish  . it  s a truly edge of your seat shocker . even more impressive though is de palma  s elegant direction that gives this film not only tight suspense but a unique and dark atmosphere of its own . dressed to kill is also a very erotic film  but mainly in a strangely beautiful way . pino donaggio also lends a lovely musical score to the film .  br    br   the cast is another strong feature of this film . michael cain does a terrific turn as a psychiatrist . angie dickenson is wonderful as the ill  fated housewife . nancy allen  s performance as an involved street  walker is solid . a young keith gordon also proves to be a worthy supporter as the investigating son .  br    br   many criticize de palma  s films for having hitchcockian elements and this film was no exception . but any similarities between hitchcocks works and de palmas can only be seen as a good quality  as calling this film a  rip  off  would be degrading to a fine thriller . dressed to kill is a must see for all cinema fans .  br    br    out of   ,1
  the first episode i saw of lost made me think  i thought what is this some people who crashed and get chased by a giant monster . but it  s not like that  it  s far more than that  because their is no monster at all and every episode that you see of lost  well it  s getting better every time . a deserted island with an underground bunker and especially the connection between the people who crossed paths with each other before they crashed . that  s the real secret .  br    br   this series rules and i can  t wait to know what  s really going on there i hope that they don  t air the last  episodes in the theaters  this series deserves a  out of    ,1
i was always curious about this film because it is so tough to find  so when i stumbled upon it on ebay i forked over the    and bought it  now i understand why its so rare  this film is so bad  so terribly written and hopelessly low budget that the ending credits  which show all of the cut scenes where they fumbled their lines  are literally the movie  s highlight . the film is about a psychic  pettyjohn  cast for one obvious reason  her topless scene  whom uses her powers with an experimental machine to pull objects from another dimension into this reality . when she pulls in some kind of box like object the military nonchalantly throws it into the open back of a truck with one soldier to guard it  and gee  what do you know  surprise  a kid in a foam  rubber monster costume pops out  instantly kills the soldier with a scratch across his face  then escapes to a nearby city . but rather than deploy half the armed forces of the county to find it and protect the public those in charge just leave it up to pettyjohn and ray to find it on their own  but no matter  this movie blows all its credibility long before then . this barely escapes being voted a  by me only because of unintentional laughs  somebody needs to alert the producers of  mystery science theater      if they don  t know about it already   out    really  really bad   ,0
i remember going to see the movie in the summer of    with my parents  and being pretty into it at the time . of course  i was seven at the time .  br    br   right before the jackson movies came out  my wife and i rented this movie since she had never seen it and i was feeling nostalgic .  br    br   ralph bakshi ran out of money about mid  way through the animation process for this movie  and was forced to drastically cut corners on this production . since this movie was done primarily with rotoscoping  the animation technique for people on a budget  this is saying something . much of this movie is animation only in the very loosest sense of the word . there are some scenes which are very obviously just people standing in front of a screen  with maybe some animation effects superimposed on top of them .  br    br   because of budget constraints  the movie   already a compression of  the fellowship of the rings  and part of  the two towers    was pared down even more . what you get is sort of like a film  strip version of the cliff notes of the books .  br    br   its not all bad  though  the animation brings a warmth to it  that i found lacking in the jackson movies . its nice to imagine what it could have been like with decent funding .  br    br   this movie is also noteworthy for having the sequel which never came . several years later  a half  hearted half  hour long tv special was aired  which was meant to wrap things up . all i will say about that is that it was a musical .  ,0
i have always liked spike lee  s movies  but this one was a total waste of     hours . i expected more about son of sam and instead got a movie that seemed to have very little to do with the     serial killings . the talking dog was laughable  you know you  re in trouble when all the movie patrons burst into laughter inappropriately  . the whole movie seemed very disjointed and not very interesting . the sex scenes were totally irrelevent to the plot . i  m not opposed to sex in movies  but it should have some point  unless it  s a xxx movie  . all in all  we were very disappointed at this spike lee effort    ,0
every so often a movie comes along that knocks me down a notch and reminds me that my taste in films i seek out to watch isn  t always impeccable . i normally would stay away from stuff like this  but i was duped by some glowing reviews and the rohmer pedigree .  br    br   there  s an initial and intriguing novelty to the production where rohmer essentially superimposes the actors onto painted  digital  back  drops of revolution era france . this quickly wanes and becomes about as interesting as watching the paint dry on a paint by numbers scene . what we  re left with is a boring and stuffy film about aristocrats in   th century france . none of the characters are appealing or sympathetic . the pace is so languid  the dialogue so arduous  and suspense is clearly a foreign concept to rohmer  that i ended up not caring whose head rolled  who was harboring who  or what the devil the revolution was supposed to be about . the movie would  ve greatly benefited from some semblance of emotional build  up and a music score  there  s some fine classical music used at the very end  . despite being so  talky   the film plays much like a silent film  and the worst kind of film at that  a dull and uninteresting film about infinitely interesting subjects . only the most astute french historians will find anything to take from this film  as it dose seem to paint well known events from a new angle  the lady is english and a royalist  . otherwise  avoid this yawner at all costs unless you are suffering from insomnia  i dozed off twice  .  ,0

this is the kind of film one watches in gape  jawed  horrified silence  and yet continues to watch  mesmerized  as if watching a train wreck in slow motion . and yet  in the back of your mind  thoughts are churning  who on earth green  lighted this garbage    br    br   some of the preceding user comments say things like   a good way to introduce children to laurel and hardy    an insult to children everywhere . that children would need some sort of training plan to learn to love slapstick comedy shows a profound misunderstanding of the nature of children the world over . others have commented on the faithfulness of the two stars  characterizations of laurel and hardy to which i would respond so what  one would think that the rash of movie bombs based on beloved series  rocky and bullwinkle  avengers  flipper  mod squad  ad nauseam  would have taught hollywood that there are some things that simply can  t be recreated . the films of laurel and hardy are readily available on video why bother with this   br    br   as for f . murray abraham  a fine actor of stage and screen . . . well  all i can say is  he must have been in trouble with the irs .  br    br   run  don  t walk  away from the television if this trash comes on   ,0
the freedom of having your own sea going power boat  the excitement of going on underwater adventures a rugged  an  s man of an adventurer and lovely  and so well endowed   assistants in fine bikinis were all definite selling points for  sea hunt           .  br    br   just what was the reason for producing a sort of sea going  gun for hire   series . let  s look closely now . there must be a some clues around .  br    br   if we were to look back just a little  we see the rko radio pictures production of underwater        . it starred jane russell  gilbert roland  richard egan and lori nelson as a quartet of very attractive scuba diving adventurers working on salvage in the carribbean  including a pre  fidel cuba . the film was moderately successful and was memorable not necessarily for its story as for the looks of the principals in swimming suits . fine  shapely women folk in some really keen  piece bathing suits  woo  woo  woo  woo   are always a plus for the guys and the presence of rugged  athletic men folk displaying their best beefcake  poses  is equally pleasing to the gals .  br    br   and there is one element that is a true legacy of this old rko feature . it is on the soundtrack contained in between the musical queues and themes . it is the recording of  it  s cherry pink and apple blossom white   written by louiguy and jacques larue and performed by damaso perez prado and his orchestra .  br    br   anyone who hears this insturmental or song  with lyrics  will not soon forget it . its carribbean beat is so very lively and its rich use of the brass section of the orchestra is powerful and instantly renders instant impression and memory . the   rpm record of this song made it to the top   most popular songs of the week for many saturday evenings on nbc tv  s  your hit parade  . we can  t remember just how many weeks nor just how high it got .  maybe some one can fill us in on that one item  please   so  we got back to  sea hunt  and its own odyssey in getting on  the tube  . the public had taken to underwater  all right  but would they go for a tv series .  br    br   ziv tv productions was getting a reputation for putting out a type of product that  for the most part  didn  t get signed on by the networks for the multi  station hook  up treatment . but they had been having some great successes with television syndication .  by that we mean  offering a series for stations for showings on a one to a tv station per each market area .  much like the various newspaper syndicates  sell  comic strips to various papers around the country  and world  even .  br    br   so  we got  mike nelson   himself  in the physical presence of lloyd bridges . mr . bridges had been around for approximately   years or so and had turned in some very memorable performances in mostly supporting and highly varying roles in a couple of boston blackie movies  with chester morris  to they stooge to conga   stooges       sahara  also       home of the brave       and the whistle at eaton falls       .  br    br   lloyd brought a very convincing manner to his characterization  along with a fine  convincingly athletic physique  having the look of a guy who makes his living with his physical abilities . he took very well as the diver  s diver  whether it  s performing duties on board ship  or fathoms beneath the sea .  br    br   and lloyd did take to the role quickly  but contrary to a lot of misinformation out there  he was not familiar with s . c . u . b . a .  prior to landing this mike nelson gig . but the athletic mr . bridges proved to be a quick learner  as so many of the close  up shots underwater revealed that there was no doubt about it  that it was lloyd with the mask  the bubbler  air tank  and the flipper fins .  br    br   stories almost always involved the helping  out some client for pay  much like a private detective would . so what if the client was a lovely lady who looked good in the bathing suit  all the better .  br    br   like so many of the other ziv  united artists tv productions   sea hunt  possessed a fine  haunting opening theme and closing  along with some original incidental music and queues .  br    br   at one time  i believe that  sea hunt  was the top syndicated tv series  a success that ziv series had known before with the likes of  science fiction theatre  and  highway patrol  . as far as the showing venue for this underwater saga  here in chicago it was shown late night  after      p . m .  on wnbq tv  channel   our nbc affiliate  now known as wmaq tv  .  br    br   and i can remember just who was the original sponsor in this particular market was . and there were even on scene commercials done by the star  how well we can remember and visualize lloyd as mike nelson  riding on his power boat . and as we were being invited to return the next week and watch  . . . . . another adventure of  sea hunt   sponsored by the g . heileman brewing company of lacrosse  wisconsin  the makers of old style lager beer    all while mike was toasting us  raising an old style bottle .  shame on you  mike  drinking beer on your moving boat  we  re tellin  the coast guard   then  the boat would leave the dock  accompanied by the sea hunt theme and rolling the credits .  br    br   note  more figuratively than literal  mike was for hire and things ran very much like a deterctive story .  br    br   note  ziv  s syndicated successes included  science fiction theatre    west point   and its clone  men of annapolis     sea hunt  and  highway patrol  .  br    br   note and of course  scuba is a acronym for self contained underwater breathing apparatus .  ,1
this was an excellent   part episode  although i had never been seen the older ones  i never thought the doctor would go up against anything that is paranormal  extra terrestial of course but not paranormal .  br    br   this episode brings the things that we most fear and how would we humans  in a futuristic time  would fight and defeat real live evil when most odds say that would be impossible .  br    br   being that it  s a family film i am surprised that they brought some stuff in like fear and faith  especially if its also going to entertain american audiences . but who care about what yanks say  we rock  doctor who has shown potential ever since from episode one from the new series in      first being so harmless to scary  from fun to serious  from light to darkness . i hope many old fans will one day soon say  the old doctor who has returned  .  br    br     out of    ,1
felix unger  jack lemmon  has just been dumped by his wife  because he is one of the most annoying  neurotic people in the world . suicide is his way out  but he just can  t seem to get it to work  so he heads over to his friends house . oscar madison  walther matthau  is also recently divorced and living it up in bachelor heaven . smoking  gambling  hitting on chicks  eating out and never cleaning is paradise to him . well  with the suicide attempts oscar decides to let felix move in . at first  it is a match made in heaven  felix cooks and cleans and helps oscar pay his alimony on time  but soon oscar is jonesing for women and felix  who in today  s world would probably be gay  isn  t ready to move on . they invite a couple of british birds over and they find felix so tender that soon they and felix are weeping and chatting about his family life  leaving oscar denied . this is it  he explodes and throws him out  but felix isn  t as helpless as it seems  and soon he has the upper hand . my favorite quote  you leave me little notes on my pillow . told you    times i can  t stand little notes on my pillow .  we  re all out of cornflakes . f . u .  took me three hours to figure out f . u . was felix ungar   based on a neil simon play  who also wrote the screenplay   this has a certain theatre feel to it . set and the repartee and looks feel quite play  like  for better or worse  . lemmon and mathau have excellent comedic chemistry and have appeared in the grumpier old men movies and out to sea  reprising the same finicky  slob roles  but with different names  to avoid royalty issues  i  m sure  .  br    br   this movie is like strawberries dipped in chocolate . the chocolate is smooth  sweet and rich  the strawberry is tart  juicy and bright red  unless you get those nasty greenish ones  . they are almost polar opposites  but together  the contrasts highlight each other and make a wonderful dessert .      br    br   http   blog . myspace . com  locoformovies  ,1
for me an unsatisfactory  unconvincing heist movie . with an a  list cast  particularly the three leads and an experienced maverick director like spike lee i was expecting far more and in the end felt that what was delivered added little to this movie sub  genre . for a start i didn  t like the pacing of the film  starting off with mastermind clive owen  s raison d  etre piece to camera  unnecessarily repeated at the conclusion  then finding the narrative peppered with confusing  not to say unreal  seeming witness interviews  then finding yourself jumped into scenes you sense had begun earlier . of course the camera work is fluid throughout  constantly on the move and incorporating hand  camera shots a  plenty  but director lee fails to deliver thrills or suspense  falling down fundamentally by not making anything of the key protagonists in the film . denzel washington is weighed down with the clothes and bad  ass jive talk of a  shaft  movie thirty  five years earlier  he even has that  no  one understands him but his woman  thing going on  replete with his  hot  girlfriend  baiting her with some downright crude and inappropriate  dirty  talk   and his mild  in the heat of the night  riff with willem defoe  in almost a bit  part  raises barely a ripple . clive owens plays his character with a resolutely english accent even as we  re given to believe the gang is arab  based  also hindered by having to play    of the film with a mask over his face . jodie foster delivers another of her patented tight  lipped  ice maiden  sub  clarice starling turns as a well connected financial bounty  hunter  if you will  to little effect . overall it  s a real mish  mash of a film  with a light but obvious twist at the end  in fact the title gives it away from the start  spoiler fans . worst scene  of many  is undoubtedly washington  s witness  interview  unbelievably  with an  year old street  kid  although owen  s dialogue with the same child minutes earlier runs it close in the embarrassment stakes . during the film in  joke references are made by characters to classic heist films like  serpico  and  dog day afternoon   but there  s no honour in self  praise . more like  the hot rock  instead . . . and even that was good for a few laughs .  ,0
first love is a desperately difficult subject to pull off convincingly in cinema  the all  encompassing passion involved generally ends up as a pale imitation or  worse  slightly ridiculous .  br    br   lifshitz manages to avoid all the pitfalls and delivers a moving  sexy  thoroughly engrossing tale of love  disaster and possible redemption  while tangentially touching on some of the deeper themes in human existence .  br    br   the core story is of mathieu     a solitary  introverted boy who meets cdric  brasher  more outgoing but just as lonely  while on holiday with his family . as the summer warms on  they fall in love and  when the holidays end  decide to live together . a year later  the relationship ends in catastrophe cdric cheats on mathieu who  distraught  tries to take his own life . he survives and  in order to get perspective back on his life he returns to the seaside town where they first met  this time cloaked in the chill of winter .  br    br   if the tale was told like this it would never have the impact it does much of it is implied  all of it happens non  sequentially .  br    br   the intricate narrative is essential to getting a deeper feeling of the passions experienced  through the use of counterpoint and temporal perspective . fortunately  the three time  lines used  the summer of love  the post  suicide psychiatric hospital and the winter of reconstruction  are colour coded warm yellows and oranges for the summer  an almost frighteningly chill blue for the hospital scenes and warming browns and blues for the winter seaside .  br    br   both main actors put in excellent performances though  whilst it  s a delight to see stphane rideau  cdric  used to his full capacity  i  m more used to seeing him under  stretched in gael morel  s rather limp dramas   jrmie elkaim  mathieu  has to be singled out for special mention you can feel his loneliness  then his almost incredulous passion  then his character crumbling behind a wall of aphasia . beautifully crafted gestures get across far more than dialogue ever could .  br    br   the themes touched upon are almost classic in french cinema our difficulty in really understanding what another is feeling our difficulty in communicating fully the shifting sands of meaning the film  s title  presque rien   almost nothing  points to all of these and  indeed  to one of the key scenes in the film in trying to understand why mathieu attempted to kill himself  a psychiatrist asks cdric if he had ever cheated on him  non enfin  oui une fois  mais ce n  tait rien   no well  yes once  but it was nothing  . cdric still loves mathieu  he brought him to the hospital during the suicide attempt  none of which we see  and tries desperately to contact him again once he leaves  but cannot understand that he has lost him forever  because something that seemed nothing to him  a meaningless affair  is everything to mathieu .  br    br   whilst the film is darker than the rather unfortunate pierre et gilles poster would suggest  it is not without hope we get to see cdric  s slow  painful attempts to get back in touch with life  first through a cat he adopts  then through work in a local bar and finally contact with pierre  who may be his next love . but here the story ends a teenage passion  over within the year  another perhaps beginning . so what was it  almost nothing  certainly not when you  re living it  ,1

excellent show . instead of watching the same old sitcom type shows where it  s the same old thing  just different  stars   this refreshing show provided an incredibly entertaining view of office situations . we have been away from watching any television for  years and after coming back  of all the shows available we look forward to watching this show on w . shame on global for pulling the plug on this one . i thought this one would be a winner . let  s be realistic about things  few canadian shows make it . everyone i talk to enjoys this show and i believe it was foolish of global to walk away . i guess they want to stick it out with the typical mind numbing shows from the states instead of pulling behind a canadian made show that had a lot of promise . don  t get me wrong  i enjoy a lot of shows on tv  but  come on people  let  s keep the variety . this unique show provided a very comedic view of a slightly exaggerated realistic side of office life and relationships  with unique characters that you don  t see on any sitcoms today or in the past . too bad that global had to say no to this one  foolish mistake .  ,1
this movie is once again  one of those movies that someone thinks or tries to make others think that they understood it . anyone who tries to make any sense of this is a moron  my advise would be to take two not one but two hits of very strong acid and at least you  ll get a visual thrill out of it   although at the end you may kill yourself for wasting your acid     being that this comment requires   lines of info  let me write something for those of you that will try to defend the movie . unintelligble . garbage . schitzoid . waste of talent . movie is ice  with paper on destination with ringing clouds  on a sunny dive in the pudding . . . . sounds like lion in a red light with seeing hair . now explain that to me      ,0
in my opinion  a guy thing is a hilarious  witty  sexy  romantic  and totally beautiful chick flick that guys will also enjoy . i thought that jason lee and julia stiles dazzled as a bewildered groom  to  be and his soon  to  be sexy cousin  in  law . if you ask me  they lit up the screen like magic . you can also feel their chemistry between them . before i wrap this up  i  d like to say that the performances were top grade  the direction was flawless  the production design was nice  the casting was perfect  and the costumes were perfectly designed . in conclusion  to anyone who  s a fan of jason lee or julia stiles  i recommend this movie . you  re in for lots of laughs and thrills  so  go to the video store  rent it or buy it  kick back with a friend  and watch it .  ,1
encompassing virtual reality  the potential of computers  communication with the past  the ongoing struggle to express your identity in a constraining society  and the fascinating ada byron lovelace portrayed by the fascinating tilda swinton  this film should have been great . but it is lousy  terrible if you consider the potential  the acting  aside from tilda swinton and karen black  veers from tolerable to atrocious . the plot construction is awkward to say the least  the modern day programmer is a dull one  note character  but half the movie is spent setting up her character  and then when ada finally appears  it is to narrate the events of her life  not to present an engaging story  swinton almost pulls this off  though  . you never fully get to know her as a real person  just an icon from a grad student  s history paper .  br    br   the digital effects  such as a digital dog and bird  are lousy and distracting  considering it was     and not     . and  finally  the script is just bad . bad  often pretentious dialog  especially the fights between the programmer and her boyfriend  which made me squirm  cold and distant characters  and zero attempt to create a sense of wonder . the programmer successfully contacts a person in the past  astonishing  but it hardly seems to surprise anyone  and her boyfriend says   well  be careful .   although we  re given no clue then or later why it might be dangerous  and it never seems to actually be dangerous .   br    br   also  despite being about computers and ada lovelace and her love of mathematics  it is clear no one involved with the script had any knowledge of mathematics or computers  any references to these subjects come across as complete mumbo jumbo that defies any suspension of disbelief .  br    br   one scene  towards the end of the movie  is quite good  a monolog by tilda swinton expressing her sadness at the fragility of life but her joy in that life . poignant  passionate  and insightful  it seems to be dropped in from another movie .  br    br   so i am disappointed in this movie  because it is a missed opportunity for a fascinating little cult film . if you find the subject matter interesting  you might want to rent it  but be forewarned . see orlando for another  much much better examination of gender roles in history with a great tilda swinton performance .  br    br   spoiler  question    br    br   at the end of the movie  ada asks that her memories not be preserved  in what i thought was the best scene in the movie  . but then the modern day programmer seems to do it anyway  transferring the memories into her little girl  hence the title of the movie  . am i correct  that the programmer violated ada  s wishes without even struggling over it  or is this another confusing plot point that i  m misinterpreting   ,0
someday somebody is going to write an essay comparing paul naschy  s  fury of the wolfman  to the great spanish surrealist films   l  age d  or  and  un chien andelou  . the naschy film is a masterpiece of delirium from beginning to end . dali and bunuel probably loved it  and ate their hearts out seeing someone do with such apparent ease what they had to rack their brains to pull off .  br    br   the film lacks cohesive structure even though it does have a plot that moves from a to b to c . some mishmash about a  professor walterman    his first name  mind you   who was bitten by a yeti monster during an expedition to tibet and hasn  t been the same since  which is understandable . one of his jealous colleagues  the insane daughter of the noted doctor wolfstein  knows about his condition and reveals that his wife has been cheating on him . but its a setup for a twisted scientific experiment to unleash his inner beast .  br    br    walterman  flips out  turns into a werewolf  kills a few people  is electrocuted  dies  is buried  unburied  taken to a castle filled with circus freaks  wired to various machines  zapped with assorted electronic effects  injected with potent elixirs  is chained up  turns into a werewolf  a woman in an evening gown with thigh  high nazi fetish boots whips him  he escapes  helps the pretty female doctor find her way out of the castle  fends off the circus freaks with a battle axe  eventually turns back into a werewolf  and has to fight to the death against the female werewolf incarnation of his cheating wife . the lady with the nazi boots shoots him with silver bullets from her luger pistol  they die together  and the pretty doctor walks off into the morning with the studly reporter  who did nothing .  look  what a beautiful day it is    br    br    la furia del hombre lobo  was written by paul naschy in a hurry . original director enrique eguilez was fired and replaced by jos mara zabalza  a drunk who was infamously intoxicated throughout the production . he was often unable to work  though he did find time to instruct his   year old nephew to make some alterations to the script  and naschy ended up directing much of the film uncredited . zabalza did rally enough to clip some action scenes from one of naschy  s previous movies   mark of the wolfman  . the scenes were fortunately good enough to use twice even if the costumes were different  and helped pad out the runtime after zabalza refused to get out of bed to finish the movie . post production was a nightmare . nobody knew who was doing the editing  the money ran out  the master print disappeared for a while  and then at a pre  release screening for a film distributor the executive arrived to find zabalza urinating into the gutter in front of the theater . he was too drunk to find the restroom but at least he made it to the curb .  br    br   yet somehow the film works  if you let it . it keys into those atavistic memories we have about murky castles  vaulted catacombs  chains  whips  gloomy moors . fans of those sort of things will find it hypnotically watchable even if the story as a whole doesn  t make much sense due to the fractured discontinuity of the execution . in one scene its pouring rain and the wolfman howls at the lightning in the next shot its bone dry and he  s howling at the full moon . then its raining again . and yet you don  t look at it as a gaffe . its like an unfolding dream where contradictions are possible  opposites are the same  and effects proceed causes first the wolfman picks up the power cable and screams  and then the cable starts sparking with electricity . people say its low budget hurts the overall effectiveness   i say the film would have been unwatchable if they had a dime more to spend . it is a marvel of making something out of nothing  and succeeds not because of what it could of had  but because of what it does . it  s easy to laugh at stuff like this and even easier to dismiss it . the trick is being able to see through the mayhem  or rather to regard the chaos as part of the effect .  br    br   paul naschy died last week at the age of   . he had been ill with pancreatic cancer for a year or more  was working on film projects right up until his last days  but passed away in madrid  spain  with his family while receiving chemotherapy treatment . his rich  varied  and surprisingly lengthy career is a legacy to a man stubbornly pursuing his artistic vision in the face of universal mainstream disinterest . and yet in all of us there is an eleven year old kid who will watch his movies like  fury of the wolfman  in rapt awe . even people who don  t like euro horror will discover something in this movie to marvel at  if only for just a minute in a couple spots . you can find it for free at archive . org or even buy it on a dvd for a nickel . it  s worth far  far more .  br    br   amusingly  naschy was horrified to learn that many others like myself regard this twisted  sick  demented little movie as a classic  if not an outright masterpiece of cinema dementia . the problems he encountered during the production and the mess of a film that was left after were perhaps too personal an artistic disappointment for naschy to forgive . i would never presume to dare to forgive it for him  but i will say this i  d rather watch  fury of the wolfman  in its dingiest  most cut and degraded fullscreen public domain print than ever sit though the overbearing  obnoxious crap churning out up at the swine flu cineplexes this or any other weekend .  br    br   the world lost a great artist this month . watch his films  and remember .  br    br        ,1
this is a very odd film . . . i wasn  t really sure what is was about  some n london lowlifes find a mute kid in the woods that they all believe is some kind of oracle and somehow makes them all  in their own way  change something about their lives that usually ends in disaster . the film ended after about   minutes leaving me feeling quite unsatisfied  almost annoyed at the pointlessness of it all . i didn  t care about any of the characters  none of them get a chance to endear themselves to the viewer .  br    br   what was the message  am i being dim  it was just too odd . what happens to runner  why does emilio shoot the kid  . . . that made absolutely no sense  pointless . can someone help me understand this mess of a film   ,0
the tragedy of the doomed ship titanic has inspired many books and movies . the battle between nature and technology always caught man  s imagination . the latest film concerning this tragedy in the atlantic ocean was written and directed by famous action movie filmmaker james cameron . the story of  titanic  involves two fictional characters  leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet  from different backgrounds  one is a hobo  artist  the other is an aristocrat  and how their love triumphs over societal barriers and the tragedy of a sinking ship that they happen to be on .  br    br   first of all  although using a historical name  this movie had little regard to history . the plot was built around two fictional lovers  french diamond  and treasure hunters . the deaths of over a thousand of people on the greatest luxury ship of its time became a mere background . many historical facts were simply forgotten . where was the radio operator that ignored the iceberg warnings  why was there no mention of the ship that was only  miles away from the titanic but did not come to the rescue because its captain failed to identify the distress signal  omitting these facts is an insult to the tragedy . and what was the point of flavoring this historical disaster with fictional cheesy romance when the story is already as sad as it is .  br    br   the overall plot was rather shallow rich equals greed and corruption  poverty equals compassion and heroism . it is very ironic to spend     million to make a movie about how money corrupts . there was absolutely no human side shown in anti  heroes . it seemed like billy zane was playing a part of the devil . casting was also very poor . if dicaprio was  inches shorter than winslet  you could swear she was his baby  sitter . the length of the movie was unnecessarily stretched to over  hours . first hour and the half was wasted on establishing the relationships between the characters that were known to audience long before they went to theater and the dialogue that was used to do so made it even worse . hearing corny pick up lines such as  i see you  and  this is my side of the ship  generated more pain than the screams of drowning people . also  jokes were too abundant and rather lame .  br    br    titanic  did involve some moving scenes such as the part when the musicians were playing while the ship was sinking but they were no way near anything original . the best thing about this film were its special effects  and that is the only thing that truly deserved an award .  br    br   although this film lacked artistical value in overall sense  the public could not resist a sentimental story starring romeo  dicaprio   and so the movie became a success . now it is safe to say that the industry will be less hesitant to invest large amounts of money in a single motion picture  so it seems that  titanic  did achieve something after all .  ,0
this film is totally garbage . some imbecilic intellectual comforting himself by making all his best to claim superiority of aristocrat over working class . nothing more than a piece of self  complacence catharsis . disgusting .  br    br   if this kind of a movie is set in us  it will sure make itself a big joke . and simply because it comes out from  the other side   it makes itself a masterpiece  a wonderful amusement for certain brain  washed and  or brain  washing westerns  some george w . maybe  . a typical cold  war sequelae  some kind of joke anyway .  br    br   i would say  if this   like expressed in this film   is all what soviet intellectuals had been thinking about all those years  then maybe they deserve all the miseries they claim they had gone through . but no   cause like many others  i  ve read and watched real masterpieces made by real outstanding soviet intellectuals . for example  something also relevant with dog   white bim black ear    both gavriil troyepolsky  s book and stanislav rostotsky  s movie   is a real masterpiece . real life  real tragedy  real sad  real pride and dignity  one of the real best of the soviet era .  ,0
this electrifying musical has more than a whiff of egotism from it  s star  the musical genius that is prince . the film is   or so minutes of posing but in truth it is easy to see why it is such a cult classic .  br    br   much like other films that centre around the struggling young musician trying to be big  this has a hint of drama in it to add a dimension to the musical numbers . while this film isn  t as good as  mile as a recent example  this is entertaining none the less and the soundtrack is much better . on the dramatic side of things the story centres around the kid  prince  a young artist and regular spot at a club . the owner of the club is frustrated with the kid  s arrogance and little does the kid know that he could soon be fired and replaced by a rival . one the side the kid  s parents are having trouble  with his dad abusing her violently . during the course of the film the kid learns a few lessons in life  and learns to appreciate his friends more . it  s all stuff we have seen in coming of age dramas of course  but this is combined as a musical  a very stylised musical .  br    br   the cast are good . prince is actually quite good on the drama side  when he  s not striking a pose . he seems human and relatable . clarence williams is very good as the abusive father as well . appollonia kotero makes a good debut as princes sexy love interest .  br    br   the main strength of the movie however is the superb soundtrack . the musical numbers are well staged and electrifying . prince is no doubt a musical maestro  albeit very eccentric . when he is inspired he is great but on the flip side he will often do songs that are solely for his own taste  and occasionally his experimentation can miss  fire  but that is the same for many musical geniuses . the soundtrack for this film is excellent though  with only sexshooter being a weak point . the show  stopping performance of purple rain is the standout though . it is one of my all time favourite songs .   br    br    ,1
it was once suggested by pauline kael  never a fan  that cassavetes thought not like a director  but like an actor . what kael meant was his supposed lack of sophistication as a filmmaker to take that comparison further  to me  it never feels like cassavetes is directing himself in a film  it feels like cassavetes implanting himself inside his own creation  like orson welles . cassavetes is just as much of a genius as welles  but far more important as a true artist  as opposed to a technician or rhetorician  . this is like a cross between italian passion  though cassavetes was actually greek  and scandinavian introversion . never before have inner demons been so exposed physically .  br    br   it  s about the mystery of becoming  performing  and acting . like a haunted skip james record  it  s got the echoes of ghosts all around . rowlands  breakdowns  which are stupefying and almost operatic  surprising coming from cassavetes  are accompanied by a jumpy  unsettling piano . who is this dead girl  the metaphysical possibilities are endless  and it  s amazing to find this kind of thing in a cassavetes film  just the overt display of intelligence  there is also a brief bit of voice  over at the beginning  . but then  he always was intelligent  he just never flapped it around for easy praise . this is not  adaptation   here  the blending of reality and fiction and drama is not to show cleverness but to show the inner turmoil and confusion it creates .  br    br   there  s so much going on . the pure  joyous love when rowlands greets her doorman the horror when she beats herself up . . . the scene where the girl talks about how she devoted her life to art and to music is one of the most effective demonstrations of understanding what it means to be a fan of someone . you can see some roots of this in  a star is born   and almodovar borrowed from it for  all about my mother .  i think the ending is a little bit of a disappointment because of the laughing fits  but the preparation leading up to it is almost sickening .  you can shoot me  but i think the alcoholism  despite its urgency in many of the scenes  is a relatively small point about the film .   br    br   it  s a living  breathing thing  and it feels like a process it could go any direction at any time . like  taste of cherry   we are reminded that  you must never forget this is only a play .  yet it is dangerous when rowlands says that line  is it great drama  how will the audience take it  is she being reflexive or does she just not care  her  character  s  breakdowns are incorporated into the performances  and ultimately the film  in such a way that it  s like witnessing a female james dean .       ,1
i shouldn  t even review this movie  since it  s not actually a horror movie   and thus not worthy of dr . cheese  s attention . at least  it  s not horror in the usual sense . it  s certainly a horrifying proposition to waste your time watching this crap . that  s why i turned it off after the first four hours . imagine my surprise  then  when the clock showed that only   minutes had passed . yep  that  s right in plain terms  this movie is b  o  r  i  n  g .  br    br    the order  had lots of flaws  not all of them unique . in particular  it seems to me the main problem with the  religious  subgenre of horror films is hollywood  s unwillingness to engage christianity on its own terms . it is quite possible to make truly creepy films that are also orthodox . just ask william peter blatty . in fact  without orthodoxy  films like this are just an anything  goes smorgasbord of the filmmakers   usually dull and illogical  imaginations .  br    br   think about it . if someone made a movie ostensibly about  say  physics  but not only got the basic laws of physics wrong  but based the entire plot on its wrong portrayals  you would soon get tired of the resulting pointless plot . the same goes for these sorts of movies .  br    br   in other words   the order   and many similar movies before it  invent out of whole cloth stuff about the catholic church and about the christian faith and attempt to build a plot out of these inventions . unsurprisingly  the plot ends up being incoherent and stupid . this movie has the added charm of being as interesting to watch as your toenails growing .  br    br   avoid this steaming pile .  ,0
this is an interesting treatment of a subject that is quite controversial   just read the other comments on this film  . apparently  you either love it or hate it and it seems most people make that distinction based on whether they believe the tribulation and end times will happen as portrayed in the movie .  br    br   basically  the film  and its sequels  were made for about   .   each . the production values are right down there with  plan  from outer space  and the acting is about on the same level as  glen or glenda    my apologies to ed wood  . putting aside the religious message  the story is as scary as they come . add in even the slightest thought that the story might actually be close to something that might happen in the future and it becomes even scarier .  br    br   this movie  and its sequels  didn  t try to bring in the reasons why the tribulation happened when it did .  left behind  and  the omega code  tried to get in everything  thief  did and to explain all the politics and maneuvering in the middle east leading up to it . the net effect was  thief  did a much better job on the scary part of movie  instead of spreading itself too thin trying to explain what was happening in the middle east at the same time .  br    br   forget the politics and watch this movie  and its sequels  for what they are  horror stories . that they may be horror stories told  indirectly  by god makes them just that much more frightening . if it makes you think about the subject  it has done its job  even if you never believe .  ,0
this is one of those films that makes you want the time you spent watching it back  and then some  like the time you spent accidentally picking it out  the time you spent getting to the video store  etc .  br    br   first off  the look it  s grainy  it  s low budget . now that in itself doesn  t make for a bad film . but the way it was filmed makes the action look unnatural  so that  s kind of distracting .  br    br   then  the story .  gals go on a gal  s weekend away from guys . of course  as everyone does when going on a camping trip  they stop on the way to get earrings . when they arrive at the area in which they  re going to stay  they get pulled over by mr . ranger sir  who scolds them for throwing a lit cigarette out of the car at fire season  and then drives them where they  re going  a remote cabin  . of course    cute guys  wander into their vicinity  and bambi  yes  bambi  and aubry are immediately smitten  but apparently bambi is smitten by anything with two legs . mady is rather disappointed by this development because she was looking forward to a weekend of forgetting about her ex by getting sh  faced and stoned with her gal  pals .  br    br   oh  and i almost forgot  there  s a mean old hermit that lives up that way  that  s perhaps someone to not tangle with  and the area  cabin in which they  re staying have a sort of  reputation  .  br    br   so of course  sooner or later  unfortunately  much later  some of our weekend wood  visitors begin to die  and find various booby traps  although a couple of them actually hit a little lower than that  and of course  the remaining campers are understandably upset . no cell phone reception of course  who would miss out on a chance to check their cell phone for reception in a movie anymore   . mr . ranger sir keeps popping up at odd times  his behavior seems a bit odd but he has said he will get help .  br    br   there  s a fantastic twist to this that you just won  t want to miss too  if you  re still awake . pray that you wake up to a blank screen .  br    br   the acting in this is terrible  the production values are terrible  and the whole undertaking is just lame  i find it amazing this was even released . avoid at all costs   out of   .  ,0
whilst reading through the comments left for this show  i couldn  t help but notice that a large percentage of the reviewers had either not actually watched any episodes of the show either all the way through or of their own free will . the thing about kerching  is that it  s a children  s show  for children so obviously if your older it is going to seem cheesy  forced  and probably stupid . i even found one person saying the sets were stupid  but i remember as an eight year old wondering why taj had ikea icecube moulds on his wall  and also wondering if my parents would let me stick some on mine  they didn  t  . yeah  it can be annoying  the acting could be better and some of the characters do really weird things with their hair  but as a kids show  i rate it      . compared to the stuff they air in its place today  well  lets just say i wish it  d be re  aired . dvd release  anyone   ,1
the question of whether or not one likes this film version of  the ghost train  invariably depends on one thing and one thing alone your reaction to the performance of arthur askey .  br    br   he tends to steal almost every scene he  s in  and not always in a good way . sometimes you wish he  d settle down or back off just a little  to allow the plot  s many characters to feature and develop  which they do to some extent  . but somehow everything keeps pointing back to askey  s tommy gander character .  br    br   personally i like the film  and even like askey to an extent . i always seem to plonk it into the vcr at those odd hours of the early morning when i can  t sleep and really can  t find the energy to watch anything else . there is something about watching old b  w movies in the quiet dark of pre  dawn that i find appealing . . . .  ,1
  panic in the streets  was a decent thriller  but i felt a bit disappointed by it . the central theme of a city being attacked by a plague in modern times is fascinating  but the film never really explores or develops it . its well made and entertaining  but its not as interesting as it should have been . the screenplay for this one is really weak and brings the whole film down . none of the central characters are really compelling or believable .  br    br   fortunately  the film is very well made so it compensates for the weak scripting . the direction by elia kazan keeps the film suspenseful and moving at a lightning quick pace . there are some standout sequences  particularly the memorable chase climax . when his direction was combined with better screenplays several years later  the man could mostly do no wrong .  br    br   the acting is also very good . richard widmark was always a watchable leading man and does what he can with an underwritten character . paul douglas spends his time yelling a bit too much but does a decent job as well . the standouts in the cast are the two villains . zero mostel  known primarily for his comic roles  is effectively slimy as one of cinema  s ultimate toady characters . jack palance is  unsurprisingly  a chilling villain .  panic in the streets  is disappointing but still worth watching .        ,1
might not consider this having a spoiler  but i  d rather be cautious than careless i never saw this movie when i was little . i fell in love with it the first time i saw it with my three year old daughter . i can watch it over and over again .  br    br   for the little acting ilene woods did in her lifetime  she was a wonderful voice for cinderella very appealing very believable . the music really fit the movie perfectly . the acting was great loved the mice   you really  hated  lady tremain and the step  sisters they were just awful . the cartoonists depicted the spoiled behavior very well .  br    br   this is a wonderful movie  especially if you are into love stories . my daughter has seen the movie about   times and still gets excited at the end .  ,1
in the movie several references are made in subtly to blade runner  but one of the most obvious is the fact the cain    and his unit are all genetic constructs  breed to be expendable warriors . but as favorite quote of mine from the movie is   you should have made them smart as well as fast  . kurt russell did a incredible job  his facial expressions or lack of in the movies gave more in the way of relating the story then the rest of the cast combined . even when he falls in love with sandra but does not know how to deal with these emotions  and his tears after being expelled from the group  or his shuddering when he is given a hug  and his attachment to the mute young boy who in many ways reminded todd of himself  and what he could have been if not for his selection to be a soldier .  ,1
this was a truly insipid film . the performances are third rate  and the dialogue is so stilted that at times it seemed to have just rolled over and died . my reason for renting this was simple find a movie with scriptwriting . i needed a visual aid for my presentation  so i figured why not use a clip  boy was i wrong . after searching my local video store  i came upon this  where it was suspiciously titled  starstruck  . i thought   what the hey   and decided to give it a try . well  i was very unhappy with my results . there was maybe one scene i could use  and meanwhile  i was practically falling asleep because of the sheer banality of the flick . so . . . . . i took this back and picked up ed wood . there  s a movie i can use as an example . then again  anything would be presentable compared to the drivel that is  starfucker  .  ,0

as a comic book reader  who still sees myself as a total kid at heart  i admit i might have been a bit biased towards this movie . i mean  there hasn  t been a good superhero movie out for quite some time  note batman forever was not a good superhero movie  . i really wanted this film to be good  and unlike most of my recent trips to the cinema  read blair witch project  i wasn  t disappointed .  br    br   mystery men was definitely not a high  effects  tension  filled action flick  it was a comedy . and on that basis  it was a success . it had everyone in the small theater laughing  and got applause and laughs right through the final scene . stiller and garofolo are hilarious together  as always  and azaria adds just the right touch of craziness . william h . macy plays a great straight man  while kel mitchell and the fart  powered paul rubens are added just to keep the kiddies happy .  br    br   though the sets are bizarre  and at times seem like ripoffs from both batman and blade runner   and some of the jokes are obvious  it is still just plain funny . there are some lines that will catch even the most jaded viewer off  guard  and bring tears from the belly  laughers among us .  br    br   i definitely recommend this movie . although not an all  time classic  it is twice as funny as the latest austin powers retread . the writing is good  and the cast is great . if you  re worried  plan on the matinee and pay less  but either way you  ll be pleasantly surprised . i mean  who among us doesn  t root for the losers once in a while   ,1
the power rangers is definitely the worst television show and completely ridiculous plastic toy line in the history of the united states .  br    br   there is absolutely nothing even remotely entertaining about this completely awful television show .  br    br   this is simply the worst show ever made  with awful actors  dressing up in multi colored spandex outfits that look completely ridiculous .  br    br   the owners of this show should be ashamed of themselves  since there is no redeeming value to this nonsense .  br    br   kids of today should try watching better shows like the toy story movies instead of this garbage .  ,0
this was a watchable movie  but plot was a little weak and most of the jokes were from some of rodney  s earlier movies . with that said  it was worth the time to watch . i gave this a  out of   . so basically  its one of those movies that you do not go out of your way to see  but if you find it on the tube  take a chance .  ,0

i think this one sucked on ice  because it left the cube  and gave us to much information as to the who  s and why  s . the original cube never left the cube  and it left everything to your imagination . this crap fest however  gives you it all . and i didn  t like it . . . though the acting is solid  i think the reason this one was a downer was because it was done by people other than the original filmmakers  if they had vincenzo natali do this prequel  or even the sequel i think it would have done better and would have been more true to the source . so i recommend you stay far  far away from this one  and hypercube  another movie i don  t even want to discuss . . .  i gave it a  for the acting only   ,0
i think that this movie was reasonbaly good . it  s kinda weird that now the olsen twins are   and have boyfriends and all . i enjoyed them alot when they were little kids on full house . anyway  the casting was good and the movie was somewhat funny . i kind of got mixed up between all the switching places and their names . it  s just kind of an older version of it takes two .  ,1
story of a man who has unnatural feelings for a pig . starts out with a opening scene that is a terrific example of absurd comedy . a formal orchestra audience is turned into an insane  violent mob by the crazy chantings of it  s singers . unfortunately it stays absurd the whole time with no general narrative eventually making it just too off putting . even those from the era should be turned off . the cryptic dialogue would make shakespeare seem easy to a third grader . on a technical level it  s better than you might think with some good cinematography by future great vilmos zsigmond . future stars sally kirkland and frederic forrest can be seen briefly .  ,0
fever pitch is a fun enough movie . it has a lot of funny moments  including a hilariously disturbing shower scene  . like most romantic comedies  it has a  dead zone  in the middle where all the heavy   she  s breaking up with me  stuff happens  but other than that it continues to be funny until the end .  br    br   even though the plot revolves around fanaticism towards the red sox  it  s not overloaded with sports . you don  t have to be a fan to enjoy this film .  br    br   of course that  s easy for me to say i  ve been a red sox fan since i was a boy  too .  br    br    out of   .  br    br   barky  ,1
one of the first of the best musicals  anchors aweigh features several memorable musical sequences  such as kelly dancing with jerry the mouse  kelly dancing with   year  old sharon mcmanus  sinatra singing with jose iturbi playing piano  kathryn grayson singing with iturbi conducting  and much more . the technicolor is perfect  with some innovative camera work such as seeing a piano played from beneath  through transparent keys  and grayson singing  seen through the finder of another camera . the plot is thin  but you get involved from kelly  s  sinatra  s enthusiasm . sailor  s on leave  they have to take home a runaway boy  dean stockwell  and sinatra falls for his aunt . to set him up with the aunt  grayson   kelly suggests that sinatra can get her an audition with jose iturbi . but sinatra  s young and naive in this one  and in his own sung words falls in love too fast . while they  re trying to contact iturbi  who  s never available  he starts to fall for another girl  barbara britton   but kelly  s now falling love with grayson . anchors aweigh is most often remembered for the combination live  action  cartoon sequence with tom and jerry  but there  s a lot more here that  s worth a look . i  m giving it nine stars because  while it  s not quite as good as the best musicals  singin  in the rain  the music man  oklahoma  it is one of the first of their class of technicolor big productions  perhaps meet me in st . louis was the first   and better than most others .  ,1
  the notorious bettie page  is about a woman who always wanted to be an actress but instead became one of the most famous pin up girls in the history of america . bettie page played by gretchen mol was one of the first sex icons in america . the type of modeling bettie page took part in included nudity and bondage which lead to a u . s senate investigation in the     s .  br    br   walking out of the film  all i could think about was how far we have come in terms of pornography since the     s . you can go on the internet now and find some of most disturbing and shocking images ever shot  that the footage questioned in  the notorious bettie page  seems almost childlike and innocent . most of the footage including the bondage did not feature nudity when bettie page was involved yet today we have sick images where we can see women having sex with animals . i find that maybe the envelope has been pushed a little too far since the     s because looking at this movie in terms of today  s pornography  it was very tastefully done .  br    br   to be honest  i was pretty impressed with  the notorious bettie page   i found the film to be very well done and interesting . the movie is exactly what the trailer leads you to believe it will be and is a very interesting look at one of the first female sex icons in america . gretchen mol looks just like bettie page and gives a very fine performance . i also thought that since the movie was shot in black and white it made the film seem realistic because it made the audience believe they were watching a film created in the late     s .  br    br   my only complaint about the film was the running time  there seemed to be a few scenes that were cut and seemed to be a little shorter than they should have been . i looked this up and it seems that   minutes was cut from the film since its original showing at the toronto film festival . also the ending was pretty tame and i was expecting a little more from it or maybe some paragraphs to come on the screen to tell the audience more about bettie page  s life where the film left off . those are my only two complaints about the film other than that the directing was solid  the acting was great especially gretchen  and the writing was good .  br    br   mary harron  who directed  american psycho   which is one of my favorite films  is the director and writer of  the notorious bettie page .  i feel that mary is a very talented director who knows how to create a setting and create great movies based on characters because like  psycho   bettie page is a character study and a fine one at that . harron captures the   s and   s with ease as well as all the characters . she is a very talented director who i hope will be around for many years to come .  br    br   bottom line  the notorious bettie page  is definitely worth a look . it  s a very interesting story that shows how far america  as well as the world  has come in terms of pornography . the film also provides a fine performance by gretchen mol who literally nails the role of bettie page on the head . and top it off with a talented director who was able to capture the look and feel of a previous era and you have a good movie on your hands . sadly  this film is probably going to flop since not many besides people who grew up in this era will show interest in the film but i think it  s worth checking out .  br    br   moviemanmenzel  s final rating for  the notorious bettie page  is a     . it  s an interesting character study about one of the most famous pin up girls and sex icons in american history .  ,1
filmed by mgm on the same sets as the english version  but in german  garbo  s second portrayal of  anna christie  benefited from practice and her apparent ease with german dialog . garbo appears more relaxed and natural under jacques feyder  s direction than under clarence brown  s  and her silent movie mannerisms have all but disappeared  which made her transition to sound complete . the strength she brought to the character remains here  although it has been softened  and garbo reveals more of anna  s vulnerability . the entire cast  with the exception of garbo  is different from the previous version of the film  and garbo benefits from not having to compete with marie dressler  who stole every scene she was in during the english  language version . in feyder  s film  garbo holds the center of attention throughout  although the three supporting players  particularly the father  gave excellent performances .  br    br   feyder  s direction was more assured than clarence brown  s  and his use of the camera and editing techniques did not seem as constrained by the new sound process as did those of brown . the film moves with more fluidity than the english language adaptation  and the static nature of the first film has been replaced with a flow that maintains viewer interest . even william daniels cinematography seems improved over his filming of the brown version . he captured garbo  s luminescence and the atmospherics of the docks with style . also  the screenplay adaptation for the european audience made anna  s profession quite clear from the start  and the explicitness clarifies for viewers who were unfamiliar with the play as to what was only implied in the brown filming . however  the film was made before the production code was introduced  which made the censorship puzzling .  br    br   garbo  s oscar nomination for  anna christie  was always somewhat mystifying  and i suspected that the nod was given more in recognition of her relatively smooth transition to sound films than for her performance . however  some of the academy voters may have seen the german  language version of the film  and they realized  as will contemporary viewers  that her  anna christie  under feyder  s direction was definitely oscar worthy .  ,1
i watched this film a long time ago  aprox   years or so  and liked it then . i remembered it the other day and decided to watch it again . the second time around was not pleasant . the acting is  so  so   the plot is illogical  unreasonable and predictable .  br    br   the acting . . . i  m sure it wasn  t a stretch for those actresses to play those characters . the plot . . . there  s no way in hell those women would have gotten away with the first robbery much less the  nd .  side note why did tt not realise that even if she came up with a load of money for her court date they would ask where she got it and she would have no logical answer  ding  ding . . . we have a crook   . it horribly stereotyped black women in saying basically that the only way black women can  beat the system  or obtain a large amount of money was to steal it and not use their intelligence or other resources . it plays too much on sympathy b  c all of them die in the end  bar jada  but it  s not sad  you  re thinking  they were so stupid they deserve to die  . you just don  t really care about the characters unless you  re a shallow person .  br    br   i can  t believe this film rates over a  .  ,0
i can see why laurel and hardy purists might be offended by this rather gentle  re  enactment   but this film would be an excellent way to introduce children to the pleasures of classic l  h . bronson pinchot and gailard sartain acquit themselves reasonably as the comedy duo and there  s a reasonably good supporting cast . i enjoyed it .  ,0
this movie sucked . the acting sucked  the script sucked  and the movie overall sucked . there were two threads in the movie that were not developed and the viewer had to do a bit of work to figure out what was happening .  br    br   i  m not saying that it needs to be spelled out  but you suddenly find things happening and being said as if you have the slightest clue as to what they are . examples  br    br   the heroine  s negative comments about the hero . the audience is never shown how she even knows anything about the guy and how he is tied into her fiance  s death . the viewer has minimal exposure to the guy  s death as well .  br    br   also  all of a sudden there is a scene with a bunch of guys loading up and cocking machine guns and that is all you see before cutting back to the other scenes . no explanation what  so  ever about the guns and the folks with them .  br    br   we gave it a  because we didn  t feel like we wanted our time back . it was fun to bad  mouth the movie while watching it  so it at least gave us a bit of entertainment .     ,0
i  m easily entertained . i enjoyed  hot shots  and  the naked gun  and their many sequels  even when most people found them unbearable . i  ve even managed to enjoy most pauly shore movies . there is only one movie that i  ve seen that i can honestly say was bad . . . and this was it . it  s been a while since i  ve seen it  but i do remember sitting in the theater thinking   this is a dumb movie . why did i see this   it  s honestly the only movie that i cannot recommend .  ,0
if you really have to watch this movie because your girlfriend is in a romantic mood  let it be boy . but prepare yourself by bringing your hp if it comes with a radio .  br    br   after having watched such a good movie as arisan        it is terrible to see what they come up with again in indonesia . it seems that the only idea is to make money  but no one seems seriously to work on the image of indonesia in the world of entertainment . that it is a  global  world doesn  t seem to come up in the minds of those who make movies in indonesia . and since the indonesian public swallows everything that is presented to them as  made in indonesia  with a flavor of the west  they get away with it .  br    br   ok  the story is nice to begin with . and it could have developed into a nice flick . but did the director never think about the fact that a musical needs first of all live music or at least good playback  and secondly good choreography  in this movie  the playback is so bad that it makes you wanna cry right there in the cinema . every single word you hear is followed seconds later by the actor or whoever sing playback  and it is extremely annoying while watching the movie .  br    br   the choreography is as if they planned to make a movie about morning gymnastics  but in the end thought it would be nice to turn it into a musical . . . they only forgot to change the choreography . it is hardly dancing you see  they jump here and there  throw their legs up in the air  and that is about it .  br    br   well  at least there  s a happy ending . . . . but if you can convince your girlfriend that a nice candlelight dinner is much more romantic  do so   ,0
i  ve only watched the first series on dvd  but would summarise the sopranos as a shakespearean plot with a tarantino  like script . the series is as good as goodfellas and casino  and almost as good as the godfather  hence not a       and far better than any of guy ritchie  s efforts . although there  s plenty of action  some of it pretty bloody  the story is character driven . even some of the minor characters contribute to great story lines e . g . the priest  s relationship  or lack of  with carmilla and the restaurateur  s wife  and christopher and his dimwit friend  who didn  t last very long  a darwin award nominee     br    br   apart from the plot  the script and the acting  the other reasons i liked it  br    br    . it made me want to visit new jersey and eat pasta with a tomatoey sauce .  . the music .  . it shows that literally anyone can suffer from mental health problems .  ,1

some of those guys that watch films and complain about them for a living are forgetting something dvd menu system . i tell you the people  i watched the main screen repeat in this one about   times . it was awesome . a cinematic tapestry of cascading brilliance that had me from where it was  which was the very beginning . many times the sum and bam  i was hooked . over and over and over . and over .  br    br    doot de doot  de doo de dodedo .  and that  s just the soundtrack   br    br   i is laid aside in the bed  curled up with my vaio . the rain is in the flat roof and tonight soft is again soft . the cat is comfortable and my ankle which crosses in me  is already rested . i popped in the dvd . i was mesmerized . through the night .  doot de doot  de doo de dodedo .   br    br   the blob . see it . steve queen  two cops  and one girl in a dress . two thumbs way up   ,1
the cure uses voice over to create an intense mood . although the vo accounts for all of the film  s lines it amazingly does not take away from the visual story . the use of multiple film stocks add a lot of texture to the story . the choice of combining b  w and color worked nicely to enhance the leaps in time . the ending will make you jump despite being able to anticipate the result . i was especially enjoyed the thrill of the film  s suspense . the close  ups for the love scene are also lovely and reflect a tasteful eye . the piece is quite short but accomplishes a lot . the tight editing really helps to show off what a short film can do . worth watching more than once   ,1
kurt russell is at his best as the man who lives off his past glories  reno hightower . robin williams is his polar opposite in a rare low key performance as jack dundee . he dropped the big pass in more ways than one .  br    br   you  ll see some of the most quotable scenes ever put into one film  as jack hisses at a rat  reno poses  and the call of the caribou goes out .  br    br   don  t miss this classic that isn  t scared to show football in the mud the way it should be played  note to the nfl  .  ,1
we viewed the vcr and found it to be fascinating . not knowing anything about this true story  i thought  oh  no  p . brosnan as an american indian   red  indian in the film   what a bad choice  until i discovered the truth about grey owl . the film does a good job of demonstrating the dignity of these native peoples and undermining the racist myths about them . and annie galipeau  wow  what a beauty  and very convincing as an indian woman  i believe she is french  canadian she sure reverts to the all  too familiar speech of such  . in spite  of brosnan  s detached  grunting style  in the end he comes through convincingly as a passionate  dedicated man . the plot is a little weak in demostrating his conversion from trapper to animal coservationist . good film  highly recommended .  ,1
this film is pretty poor . the acting is abysmal and completely forced . furthermore  by shooting the film as a docudrama doesn  t necessarily make it more believable  you can  t get out of it that easily mr dir . don  t let my comments mislead you however  as i would recommend you watch this film  as it does shed some light on the psychology or non existent psychology behind the perpetrators of such crimes . however  the climax of the film is absolutely rubbish  there is no other way to put it  it pure and simply fails to capture any sense of atmosphere  what takes place does not translate to me any feelings of desperation  panic  fear or dread that one would surely experience in such terrifying circumstances . no instead it leaves you with jaw dropping  was that it    spilling from your tongue  and by no means are you haunted by these boys actions . rather you just feel embarrassed for yet another film that started with potential  but ended up falling flat on its face at the most crucial point . zero day indeed . . . . zzzzzzzzzzzzz  ,0
i recently saw this movie in my international business class . i was not expecting anything other then another boring documentary  not to say i don  t love documentary i  ve just hard bad luck with movies in that class  imagine my surprise when this movie  that  s actually a movie  came up .  br    br   this film is a tell all of cultural differences in the work place and how they need to cooperate to get anywhere . the culture clash shows just how different the world is and just how differently we perceive ourselves until someone comes along and gives us a wake up call . i would highly recommend this film to anyone in business or who just wants a laugh  because yes it is funny .  br    br   well  that  s about it  cheers  ,1
a great suspense movie with terrific slow camera  work adding to the dramatics makes this a treat to watch and enjoy . director  writer brian de palma does a super hitchcock  imitation  many called it a  ripoff   with this film and the  .     widescreen dvd is a must to fully appreciate the camera  work  and several scenes with people hiding on each side which are lost on formatted  for  tv tapes  .  br    br   the downside of the movie  at least to anyone that has some kind of moral standard  is the general sleaziness of all the characters  including the policeman played by a pre  nypd dennis franz  who has hair here   .  br    br   the opening scene is still shocking with a fairly long shower scene of angie dickinson that is quite explicit  even   years after its release . the film has several erotic scenes in it as dickinson  if that is really her on the closeups  and nancy allen are not shy about showing their bodies .  br    br   there is not much dialog in the first   minutes and no bad language until franz enters the picture after the murder . the first   minutes are riveting and even though it  s apparent who the killer is  it  s still very good suspense and fun to watch all the way through  particularly for males ogling the naked women .  ,1
this movie deals with one of the most feared geriatric diseases among the aging today . as one who has encountered a number of families who are facing the potential of alzheimer  s or who are in the formative stages  i would suggest that every health care giver recommend this movie to any family facing the trauma of this disease . the movie is designed primarily to speak to the family of the patient and reaches into the very heart of the struggle . casting is excellent and the dramatic portrayal is outstanding with a very commanding plot line .  ,1
this is a re  imagining of tarzan in the era of the soloflex and apocalypse now . there  s nothing inherently wrong with using films eased moral constraints to portray an erotic side to the tarzan legend . there  s nothing inherently wrong with the premise that tarzan doesn  t speak . there  s plenty wrong with suggesting a woman who could get herself to an african jungle in      could be this offensively stupid and plastic . bo has as few lines as possible when bodies are explored because this movie is merely a video  centerfold  as neutral as possible so that you can project yourself and your lecherous fantasies into the project . if it succeeds anywhere it  s in the implication that national geographic has influenced the way the imagery of a tarzan movie might be constructed .  br    br   it would be ridiculous to argue that movies shouldn  t employ the sexual tease as one of many tools to draw in viewers . some really great film moments incorporate it . but this move is at the opposite end of the spectrum  the tease is the only thing going on here at the time of its release and now . you sit through awful  dumb scenes that offer no interest  and miles of footage of bad acting to drool over the next peek at either of two bodies . yes . . . bo derek and miles o  keeffe are beautiful  um  congratulations on having a working libido .  but if that  s your excuse for giving this schlock a good rating you really should visit a porn store and stock up . there  s only a hairs  breadth difference between the two formats and  i  m just guessing here  a horny viewer would probably really enjoy the latter . the question is whether a mainstream movie is the best venue in the marketplace for viewers to seek out products that satisfy lust alone .  br    br   as a showman  john derek successfully capitalized on the sexual mystique developed over wife bo in the movie      and created a media event out of a shallow project whose only merit was the hotness of the two leads . the movie itself was beside the point . he was about   years ahead of his time in thinking audiences would applaud him for making an insipid  shallow movie that was only about showcasing superficiality .  br    br   as a director  john derek appears to require only that mrs . derek look pleasant  empty and hump  able in every scene . it  s hideously shot . the camera placement is annoying . in terms of editing  the entire  wipe  catalog is exhausted . the credit sequence is garish . and it  s a toss  up as to who commits the worse screen offense bo derek who  s such a bimbo that she can  t even figure out how to play a bimbo  or richard harris who shouts every line  as he likes to do  until you want to shoot him . at least with bo you can imagine her blaming some horny writer for shortchanging her .  ,0
branagh is one of the few who understands the difference between a film and a play . hamlet is probably the most faithful adaptation of shakespeare to a film and yet is a very dynamic film  almost an action thriller . the scene of hamlet  s meeting with his father  s ghost won  t leave your mind .  ,1
there  s little to get excited about  dan in real life  . first off  the whole setup is incredibly contrived . did you really believe that during that very long first meeting conversation at the restaurant  marie wouldn  t have told dan where she was going  and since dan did all the talking during that conversation  why would she be so attracted to him  for that matter  i never figured out why marie was so attracted to dan throughout the movie . he  s very narcissistic and does little to convince us that he  s truly a good guy  for example he lies to marie in the bookstore  ridicules his brother about his past girlfriends and tries to make marie jealous with a  blind date   . there  s more contrivance such as that ridiculous scene at the bowling alley where dan and marie are caught making out by the whole family . yeah like that could really happen . dan in real life is slow  paced  sappy and manipulative . even chick flicks like the jane austen book club get higher marks than this predictable  tearjerker  .  ,0
like too many recent british films  this one takes a great cast and gives them a flimsy  cliched script to work with . the performances save it from total disgrace  and it has some charm but it certainly didn  t make me laugh . where are all the great british writers hiding   ,0
while not exactly offensive  the     version of  the perils of pauline  is certainly moronic . the title might lead you to expect a tribute to pearl white  the original pauline in the     silent   episode serial  but for that you would be better served by the     version starring betty hutton . this     version is like a mix of  casino royale  and the weakest of the elvis movies . worst of all it is not a blend of these but more like someone scotch  taped together segments from each so that the thing skips back and forth between the two styles .  br    br   what unity there is in the production comes from the pairing of pamela austin  pauline  and pat boone  george steadman   a good match because both lack even the most basic of acting skills  imagine mandy moore playing opposite dan quayle  .  br    br   austin would later play opposite john aston in  evil roy slade   with the talent disparity between them actually painful to watch . in the mid     s she was the  dodge rebellion  girl  as such she was featured in a similar series of perilous situations  imagine sandra dee in a dark blue jumpsuit . when the automaker  s ad agency replaced her with the  dodge fever  girl someone got the bright idea to showcase her in a feature film .  br    br   what story there is here begins with pauline growing up in the baskerville foundling home run by the actress who played mrs . chatsworth osborne sr . on  dobie gillis  . george falls in love with her  pauline  not mrs osborne  and sabotages several opportunities she has to be adopted . george leaves to seek his fortune and   year old pauline gets a job tutoring a young oil rich middle eastern prince . when he tries to add the attractive blonde to his harem she runs away and goes from peril to peril . these include african pygmies  a    year  old millionaire who wants to freeze her until his one year  old grandson is old enough for marriage  the movie industry  and the russian space program .  br    br   all this is intended to be silly and charming but manages only the silly part . there is some effort to incorporate a silent film look to the action sequences by simulating the under  cranking of a camera  which speeds up the action  . unfortunately everything else  film stock  production design  editing  is depressingly      s . nothing here even approaches the images of pearl white strapped to a log moving toward a buzz  saw or tied to railway track waiting for the approaching train .  br    br   then again  what do i know  i  m only a child .  ,0
i don  t pretend to be an authority on actors who have played othello  but i  ve never witnessed a performance of the play  on film or on stage  wherein othello was portrayed with more humanity and authenticity .  br    br   according to the biographical notes  fishburne never received any professional training as an actor . perhaps this explains why his acting  in this beautifully edited film  comes over as so believable and so powerful . instead of chewing the scenery in the approved fashion for such high  powered roles  fishburne  s portrayal is focused more on othello  s love for his wife  and on his profound sadness at her supposed betrayal  than on violence and vengeance . in a word  the performance is understated  and made far more impressive by fishburne  s extremely intelligent interpretation than it otherwise would have been .  br    br   the acting throughout is superb  and the  abridged  speeches gain grace from their light editing .  even shakesspeare  after all  can be improved upon  now and again   and if that be treason  make the most of it   ,1
whack    i got this movie because elizabeth hartman was in it . i was disappointed to find out she was in like two short scenes towards the end . other than that i was basically hitting the fast forward button the entire time . some teenager goes on a trip to romania with his dad and gets bitten by a wolf and turns into a werewolf if there  s a full moon . he kills his father and friends . about   years past but he doesn  t age a bit and enrolls in a high school . there he meets a shy teacher whom he ends up biting and then has kids with her . this movie sucked and i don  t recommend it to anyone . read war and peace instead . only ms . hartman did a great job . check out a very young bob saget in this one    ,0
i dug out from my garage some old musicals and this is another one of my favorites . it was written by jay alan lerner and directed by vincent minelli . it won two academy awards for best picture of     and best screenplay . the story of an american painter in paris who tries to make it big . nina foch is a sophisticated lady of means and is very interested in helping him  but soon finds she loves the guy . meanwhile gene kelly falls for lovely damsel  leslie caron . his main dancing partner  and i must say they are fantastic together on the floor and otherwise . famous french singer georges guietary sings  too . so if you like good smooth dancing and fun filled scenes filled with oscar levant  s nimble piano fingers  the songs of george gershwyn will live on forever in this colorful gem .      ,1
i saw this film at the toronto international film festival . filmed during an actual qualifying match for the     world cup  offside works brilliantly as both a comedy and a tragedy . the film follows the fortunes of a group of young women who are caught trying to sneak into a football match at tehran  s azadi stadium . the country  s islamic religious leaders have decreed that women may not sit with men at sporting events  lest they be exposed to cursing and other morally questionable behaviour . this hasn  t stopped the country  s young female fans  who continue to sneak in using various tricks . but panahi focuses on a small group who have been caught and are being detained agonizingly close to the action . they beg the bored soldiers guarding them to let them go or at least to let them watch the match . the soldiers tell them they shouldn  t have tried to get in  that they could have watched the game at home on tv . they banter back and forth in almost real  time as the game continues  just off  camera .  br    br   there is one very funny sequence where a young soldier accompanies one of the girls to the restroom . since there are no female restrooms at stadiums  he has to clear the room of any men before he can allow her to go in . plus  he makes her cover her face so no one can see she  s a woman . this is accomplished using a poster of iranian soccer star ali daei as a mask  with eye holes punched out .  br    br   you get a real sense that even the soldiers are baffled by the prohibition  and are only carrying out their orders so as to hasten the end of their compulsory military service . one soldier complains that he was supposed to be on leave so he could take care of his family  s cattle in the countryside . little by little  the girls and the soldiers talk to each other  and there are numerous small acts of kindness on both sides to show that these are basically good people living in terrible circumstances . however  the soldiers  constant reminder that  the chief  is on his way lends a sense of menace  since we don  t know what sort of punishment the women will face .  br    br   unlike most iranian films  which are known for their strong visuals  offside is filmed in a realist style with no artifice . in fact  the film was made during the actual qualifying match against bahrain that took place on june       . the  plot  in many ways was determined by the result on the pitch . if iran won the match  they would qualify . if they lost  they would not . since the world cup has come and gone  i don  t think it is a spoiler to say that iran won the match . the scenes of celebration at the end of the film were real and spontaneous  which gave the film a real authenticity . seeing how much this meant to the people of iran was deeply touching .  br    br   as well  one of the young women makes reference at the end of the film to seven fans who died during the iran  japan match on march    just a few weeks before . they were trampled to death after police began to spray the crowd with water to move them in a certain direction . knowing that this was a real  life tragedy added another level of poignancy to the celebrations .  br    br   i don  t want to go off on a long political tangent  but this film gave me real hope that there are those in iran who are hoping for change and working at it . iran is a nation of young people  and it is only a matter of time before they take the place of their elders in the political sphere . films like this one show the proud spirit of the iranian people in spite of their present difficulties  and it  s my sincere hope that there is a brighter future for them .  ,1
as the number of video nasties i  ve yet to see dwindles  this little pile of garbage popped up on my  to rent  list when i saw it was available .  br    br   the premise involves a fashion model or something being kidnapped and taken into the jungle to be held for ransom by a motley crew of idiots . some other goof gets hired to bring her back and is given a sack of money to use as a bargaining chip  though if he returns with the girl and all the money  he gets a significant cut . he  s brought a helicopter and pilot with him and  wow  that pilot is one of the worst actors ever  granted  they are all totally terrible and the dubbing will make you cry blood . after stealing away into the jungle  we learn that nearby is a cannibal cult whose flesheating earthbound god wanders the woods like a human king kong looking for tribeswomen to ravage and devour . now  this fellow is just a naked guy with some of the worst makeup ever  ping  pong balls for eyes and that  s pretty much it . his growls and groans are an everpresent feature on the soundtrack  and i found myself muting much of those scenes .  br    br   oh  did i forget to mention the almost constant nudity  this is probably the main reason this film was banned  though there is one specific scene  about one second long  where the god attacks a girl and pulls her guts out  but it  s not a redeeming factor for gore fans . also  jess franco goes beyond the usual t and a and shows lengthy close  ups of female genitals  and  sadly  male as well . so  if you want  fair  in terms of exploitation  you got it .  br    br   i can  t recommend this trash to anyone . it  s not even the good bad movie . it  s just atrociously padded trash that only a video nasty fan will probably view and even then  if you are making your way through the list  leave this for the very last . if you watch it first  you may get the notion that this is the norm for the list  which is certainly not true .  ,0
i wanted to like this film  yes its a saw  blah blah blah ripoff but i like those films . if done well this had all the ingredients of being a good  not brilliant  but good film . . . . unfortunately those ingredients had gone off  the acting was terrible  and this was first seen when the captives are introduced with their captor one by one  hoods taken off   the remarks and one liners are just terrible  yes i know  bad writing . . . . but this is more than that  it was bad writing coupled with bad acting . two of the captives had been in a relationship with each other and did not even acknowledge this until a lot further into the film . . . . .  br    br   sorry  im even wondering why i am bothering to review this movie at all .  br    br   i will end with plot holes  plot holes  more plot holes  disappointing   ,0
the    s is an occasionally entertaining film  most of this entertainment is from laughing at the film . it is extremely uneven  and includes many annoying elements . take for instance the switch between black  white  and color . if done right  this could of been fairly effective  but because it was done poorly  it turned into a nuisance and only detracted from the already bad experience much of the film had an odd feel to it . the acting wasn  t extremely bad for a made for tv flick  but then again it was downright embarrassing at other times . many of the events were not coherent  and ending up being confusing . how did this family somehow end up being at many of the big events during the      s  the ending was much too sappy for my tastes because it was hollywoodized  everything had to turn out right in the end . i would advise you to not waste your time on the    s and do something else with your time . i  m glad i watched this in class  and not on my own time . i think i can safely say that the best part of the movie was the inclusion of bob dylan  s music . those are just my rambling thoughts on the flick . i hope you take my advice  and stay away from this .  ,0
wow  what a great cast  julia roberts  john cusack  christopher walken  catherine zeta  jones  hank azaria . . . what  s that  a script  you say  now you  re just being greedy  surely such a charismatic bunch of thespians will weave such fetching tapestries of cinematic wonder that a script will be unnecessary  you  d think so  but no . america  s sweethearts is one missed opportunity after another . it  s like everyone involved woke up before each day  s writing  shooting  editing and though  you know what  i  ve been working pretty hard lately  and this is guaranteed to be a hit with all these big names  right  i  m just gonna cruise along and let somebody else carry the can .  so much potential  yet so painful to sit through . there isn  t a single aspect of this thing that doesn  t suck . even julia  s fat suit is lame .  ,0
left behind is an incredible waste of more than   million dollars . the acting is weak and uninspiring  the story even weaker . the audience is asked to believe the totally implausible and many times laughable plot line and given nothing in return for their good faith . not only is the film poorly acted and scripted it is severely lacking in all the technical areas of filmmaking . the production design does nothing to help the credibility of the action . the effects are wholly unoriginal and flat . the lighting and overall continuity are inexcusably awful even compared to movies with a tenth of the budget . however none of this will matter in that millions of families will no doubt embrace the film for it  s wholesomeness and it  s religious leanings and who can blame them . however it is unfortunate that they will be forced to accept  rd rate amatuer filmmaking .  ,0
pufnstuf is what it is . i saw this in the cinema at age  and i have very fond  and vivid  memories of it . seeing this as as adult allows one to catch the references that are way over the heads of the target audience  like the bit where jimmy  s grey witch wig is ripped off and witch hazel  cass  sneers  i knew she had brown roots   . it is of course heavily influenced by the flower power culture of the time  and in some ways quite progressive . the track different  for example sends a clear message to the young viewers about being yourself  not running with the pack  and cherishing what is is about yourself that is different . this could be an anthem to the gay community  it should be  great track .  br    br   martha raye  cass elliot and billie hayes are all great as witches  and the living island cast give it their all in the confines of their character suits  includes billy barty  felix silla and other famous names  . there is a lot of over acting in this film  there  s really nothing subtle  and when little jack wild has to emote his concern for the kidnapped residents of living island it  s really little more than yelling . this is drama and comedy spread on with a trowel . while i think of it  i never could stand the flute though .  br    br   i love the soundtrack  especially the above mentioned different but also zap the world  pufnstuf and even jack wild  s touching if i could . what  s more  it is now out on cd from the tasteful people at el records in london . see here for more www . cherryred . co . uk  el  artists  pufnstuf . htm  ,1
nikolai gogol  s story  viy  has been filmed again and released to home video in the us via faith films .  br    br   the original story concerns a priest who has to watch over the body of a witch with only his faith to protect him . greatly expanded and set in america  though clearly filmed in russia  the houses  clothing and furnishing are all wrong despite the english signs   this is an odd film that doesn  t really work . part of it is the weird setting that tries very hard to be backwoods america but clearly isn  t . there are also some weird  intentionally oblique moments as the main character being a reporter at the start and a priest a short time later . i  m not sure why they did that  even after watching the making of piece on the dvd  the other problem is the dubbing which is beyond awful . its done in such away that everyone speaks when their lips are not on camera  or if they are the voices don  t even remotely match the lip flaps . i don  t know if its faith films fault or that of the producers who made the film hoping to dump into the west  revealed in the making of piece  .  br    br   the film isn  t very good . as i  ve said it has all sorts of technical issues that just make this an odd ball curio . despite some really good looking horror images the film never works as a horror film . as film to engender faith its much too confused in this retelling to amount to make anyone feel anyone closer to god .  br    br   given the choice i  d give it a pass  even at a bargain bin price . my advice would be to find the      s version of the tale called viy which will bring both some shivers and some understanding about a belief in god .  ,0
 . . . this is  above all else  the typical crown international pictures drive  in  read  passion pit   programmer . the     sammy johns hit record  chevy van  is heard repeatedly on the soundtrack  this movie has even been reissued with the title chevy van   despite the film  s title vehicle being a dodge . danny devito makes only six minutes of on  screen appearance  but countless vhs reissues falsely credit him as the star of the flick . the movie is a comparatively sexist morality tale   will bobby find sexual satisfaction through the one  night  stand his customised van facilitates  or must he wait until tina  the girl of his dreams  gives him the time of day  still  it is representative of the prevailing carnal dream of male american high schoolers of the time  and on that basis alone the van has  almost in spite of itself  become an artifact of the period that must be referenced in any honest retrospective of the period  s popular american cinema . . .  ,1
john van druten  s  bell  book and candle  is a delightful and unexpected fantasy about a coven of modern  day witches living in new york city it was obviously an attractive movie property . it had a stellar part for gillian holroyd  for her erstwhile book publisher enforced  sweetheart  shepherd henderson and her madcap family and circle  including shep  s bewildered fiance  the hateful merle kittredge  against whose chances with shep gillian begins her magical spell  casting . it even had pyewacket  a siamese cat  familiar with well  timed miaows  sidney redlitch  a fake witch expert with atrocious pretensions and bad manners . in short  it seemed to its producer  perhaps  box  office magic . and so it proved to be . so many things were right about its production  it only had one element not perfect but i found the rest to be amusing  charming and very consistently  entertaining . to begin with  the screenplay by daniel taradash kept the best qualities of the fine theatrical play but opened out its scenes to include greenwich village and other areas of new york  s scene . the technical production was beautiful  with cinematography by the legendary james wong howe  a fine score by george duning  more  than  clever sets by louis diage and gowns by jean louis . in the attractive cast were wolfe barzell  howard mcnear  janice rule as merle  ernie kovacs as redlitch  jack lemmon as gillia  s mischievous brother  wonderful comediennes elsa lanchester and hermione gingold as fellow witches and lovely kim novak in one of her most touching parts as gillian . jimmy stewart was the imperfect element in my judgment he did well with the comedic portions of his part  but he was never convincing as a new york book publisher  and a bit too  old for the part of henderson anyhow . but director richard quine used subtle lighting  pace changes  and unusually  composed shots to indicate the oddness of the witch portions of the film  keeping the other portions very luminous but straightforward in their presentation . the plot  s main crisis in the film comes to pass when in reality gillian falls for henderson  who does not believe in witches at all . she started out merely to alienate him from his fiance  her stuck  up college rival . later  when henderson tries to walk out  he keeps coming back to her   and realizes he is under a spell  as she has apologetically tried to explain to him . . . meanwhile  sidney redlich has been summoned by witching spell to come to new york to sell his book to henderson . of course he knows nothing at all of magic  but is quite puzzled and interested to find out why he had come anywhere at all but gillian  s brother enlightens him . all comes out right in the end in this romantic satire as gillian proves her love to henderson by losing her powers   which is what happens to witches when they truly love a mortal . of course  he never really wanted to resist her anyhow . the film has sprightly dialogue  charm  and a little  magic  of its own in the fey charm of the witches and the torments gillian must undergo in her battle with herself  and to win the man she loves . a lovely ending to this beautifully  photographed and unusual romance makes its amazing realism  though a fantasy  just about complete in my view . memorably delightful .  ,1
this movie goes beyond just being bad  it is definitively the worst movie i have ever seen in my entire life . unless you yourself have a problem with necrophilia than you will not enjoy will not enjoy the scenes depicting it in this film   if you can call it that  .  ,0
the funniest scene of this movie is probably when our saviours get their medals and plaques and whatnot . so the basic idea is  the police outnumbers these gangsters by like a million to one  but they  re powerless because the villains  guns are just a bit bigger . i guess police ammo just kinda bounces of . they decided to shoot this movie in documentary style with fake interviews and all and seriously  what is wrong with these guys  they  re talking like they were armed with rolled  up newspapers . okay i admit  it  s probably still dangerous to be in the line of the fire  even when the situation is so much to your advantage  but don  t go nuts . and why the hell did it take   minutes to solve everything anyway  i  d say that  s a very long time when you have them surrounded and you  re allowed to shoot . they  re like ten ft . away  they hit absolutely nothing . then they go and buy bigger guns themselves to increase their heroism . and then yeah  there you have it  one of the cops actually hits someone . bullet was probably diverted by a lamp post or something . i had a good laugh i guess .  ,0
it should come as no shock to you when i say that alone in the dark is a crappy movie . to put it bluntly  it  s as if a dung monster defecated  ate the result  and then vomited . the final product would still outshine this movie .  br    br   seemingly based on an ancient    atari video game  the movie has something or other to do with a portal to the bowels of the earth  the unleashing of demons  and ancient civilizations . something about there being two worlds  that of darkness and that of light .  guess which one  s ours .  oh  and       years ago a really super  duper advanced civilization opened the portal  demons came over and had a blast  then wiped out the civilization . which is why we  ve never heard of them  conveniently enough .  br    br   christian slater  perhaps pining for the days of heathers and pump up the volume  plays edward carnby  a paranormal researcher to whom something bad happened when he was   years old . he  s hot on the trail of one of the artifacts of said advanced civilization . carnby used to be part of a secret institution called     which has been trying to figure out what happened to that long  ago civilization . but carnby believed he wasn  t going to be able to find the answers he sought  so he left the group .  br    br   but see  these beasties are out  and they get their prey in varying ways  such as gutting them  splitting them down the middle  implanting neurological control devices in them  or just turning them into killing zombies . yes  it  s another zombie movie .  br    br   that  s about as distilled i can make the plot . it  s pretty convoluted and incomprehensible . in similar movies  one might see the intrepid researcher  adventurer figure things out a step at a time  and when we the audience are mentally with the researcher  it  s a lot of fun . but when the scenes shift from attack to attack with no perspective or context . . . not so much fun .  br    br   the acting is dreadful  save for slater  who  although he almost seems embarrassed to be in the movie  showed he was capable of carrying the acting load . he had to get this  tara reid is cast as a museum curator  honest to goodness  i thought i  d seen the casting of a lifetime when denise richards was cast as a nuclear physicist in tomorrow never dies . but reid here matches richards  crappy emoting for crappy emoting . hightlights include reid pronouncing  newfoundland  as  new fownd land   reid delivering most of her lines in a dazed  throaty monotone  kinda like she  d been on an all  night bender for the past week before filming   reid  a museum curator  mind you  spending a lot of the movie in a midriff  bearing top and hip  hugger jeans . oh yeah  she was as believable as jessica simpson giving stock quotes . oh  why must the pretty ones be so dumb   note i don  t think tara reid  s all that good looking . she looks like she  s in perpetual need of food .  almost everyone else in the cast is completely forgettable  except perhaps for steven dorff  who played burke  one of the leaders of    . dorff  s character wasn  t terribly well developed  but nothing in the movie was  from the sets to the characters to tara reid . but i digress .  br    br   anyway  the perplexing and utterly preposterous storyline is tough enough to follow with the film moving at such a breakneck pace  but director uwe boll tosses in a pounding  mind  deadening soundtrack it  s so loud you can  t hear what the actors are saying in some of the scenes  that can  t be right . given the acting level  however  perhaps thanks are in order to mr . boll .  br    br   oh  and a fun note . the opening moments of the movie include narration . . . of the words that are crawling across the screen at the same time . remember the first star wars  you heard that now  familiar star wars theme while the prologue crawled . there was surely no need for narration why do i need some doofus to read what  s on the screen for me  were the producers simply looking out for blind people  maybe that also explains why the soundtrack was so loud  they were also looking out for hard  of  hearing people . also  the narrator inexplicably had a lisp for the first few lines of the crawl  then lost it . bizarre .  br    br   alone in the dark is a loud  dopey mishmash of dreadful acting  an incoherent script  and ham  handed directing . hardly a note rings true . there  s so much chaos that the audience simply gives up caring about the characters and roots for their demise . even in the dark  the demonic creatures seem cooler and much more developed by comparison .  br    br   ironically  since there were only three other people in the theater  i watched this alone in the dark . i wonder if uwe boll planned it that way  i can  t quite give this the lowest rating  because i had low hopes for it to begin with  and because it never grabbed me enough for me to get worked up about it . it  s atrocious  although slater redeems himself a tiny bit .  ,0

as big as a texas prairie and equally as boring . even liz taylor  james dean  chill wills  and dennis hopper can  t float this overbloated boat . taylor actually looks bad   wrong wardrobe  wrong hair  and wrong makeup   a unique accomplishment in her remarkable career . hopper gives the only believable performance  and dean in the climactic scene displays remarkable talent as something we usually don  t remember him for   a comic actor . rock hudson is his usual prototype of barbie doll ken and makes one wonder what a  say  redford could have done with the male lead . there is no discernible plot that provides any tension until the final twenty minutes  just a pastiche of milestones that have little relationship to each other . except for hopper  there is no character development  only a collection of cardboard cutouts that pop up periodically for no discernible reason like random targets in a shooting gallery . to its credit  the film does tackle racism and sexism at a time when they were taboo subjects  and it does have size  making it an excellent choice for ridding yourself of unwelcome house guests . those with the dvd version can spare themselves some of the tedium by starting with the second disk . you won  t be missing anything of interest .  ,0
wonderland is the fascinating film chronicling the x  rated film star john c . holmes involvement in the brutal wonderland murders .  br    br   the movie  s promotion misleads one into thinking this a romanticized portrayal of the porn industry in the vein of boogie nights and that is not the case here . in fact  except for a few references made by newscasters that john holmes is a porn star and a brief montage of real  life footage of john holmes this film is strictly drama about a fallen celebrity  s involvement with murder and how it happened .  br    br   despite being mislead the film is actually engaging . the acting from all the cast is excellent and i  d like to say that val kilmer is amazing in his ability to get down all the mannerisms of john holmes . i was completely convinced that i was watching what john c . holmes probably looked and acted like in real life .  br    br   if you are a john c . holmes fan or like stories about hollywood then i think you will enjoy watching wonderland .  ,1

frailty is a non  gory horror film that achieves its chills by following the logic and impact of a man  s delusion  obsession straight into depravity . dad  we never learn his name  is a gentle man and loving father who  s raising his sons alone after mom died giving birth to the youngest son  adam . the family  s world flips upside down late one night when dad rushes into the boys  room and tells them god has given him a vision . and what a vision  the entire family  s job is to destroy demons  who  of course  are disguised in human form .  br    br   proceeding from this premise  the movie is unflinching in following it . dad kidnaps people  demons whom god has told him to destroy  binds them  lays his hand on them to see a vision of their evil  then kills them  while making his young sons watch . fenton  the older boy  is horrified  seeing only a father who  s turned into a crazed murderer . adam  the younger  is uncomfortable  but trusts that dad is following god  s will . eventually  dad takes his sons on missions to abduct the  demons  that god has put on dad  s list  and finally  invites them to fully participate in god  s mission for the family .  br    br   this is not  you understand  an abusive father . he loves his children . he is only following god  s instructions  this is our job now  son . we  ve got to do this .  when fenton  terrified and convinced his father has gone mad  says he  ll report him to the police  his father explains   if you do that  son  i  ll die . the angel was clear on this .  the pressure that the children are under is unbearable and tragic  and warps their entire lives .    the movie  s structure is similar to the one used in the usual suspects a story in flashback  told in a police station to a fbi agent . the moody lighting  the stormy weather  and the eerie calm in the present day add to the menace of the backstory . i wanted to believe the unfolding horror was just a story  until i remembered the real  life parallel of andrea yates  who believed she was possessed by satan and could save her children by drowning them . even then  i wanted to believe that i was watching a human tragedy  rather than a story of divine retribution .  br    br   the movie gave me no such comfort  though  as it gave strong clues at the end about the veracity of dad  s vision . and this  as much as some plot holes  posed a problem for me . regardless of the accuracy of dad  s visions  regardless of the evil that his victims may have committed  where does anyone derive the authority to act as an angel of death     roger ebert review          ,1
full marks for pacino  s rendering of the speech over the dead kid  s coffin shakespeare  s mark antony would be put to shame    br    br   was it paul schrader or was it ken lipper who should be complimented on the remarkable dialogues  they are rich and intelligent and well worth your time if you like movies with good scripts . i found the story narrative developing quite well right up to the voice  over postscript .  br    br   there is little else to talk about in this film even john cusack has done better roles than this one . interestingly  the film is very male oriented   the women are mere appendages .  ,1
how i got into it when i started watching this series on cartoon network  i have to say that i  ve never seen anything like this  and it was the best . but when i started collecting the series on vhs  and years later on dvd part of bandai  s anime legends collections . it was amazing  and truly worth watching . it had a lot of exploding action that will blow you out of your seat . and of course  the theme songs  just communication   and rhythm emotions  were the best .  br    br   characters  and gundams my favorite characters in the show wereheero  duo  relena  treize  lady und  noin  and zechs . my favorite gundams in the show that i liked the most are the wing zero  and epyon  and of course the altron  and deathscythe i  and ii .  br    br   meaning of the show what this series also tells us that in real life  wars are very hard and we can sometimes win  or lose . but peace can also be hard to obtain  and i do believe the gundam pilots are doing the right thing  and are trying to obtain world peace .  br    br   but however  this show is truly the best of the best . so in closing to this review  after you watch this show  see the movie endless waltz .  ,1

another norman lear hit detailing the problems that african americans had to go through in the turbulent     s and     s .  br    br   with esther rolle and husband along with  children living in a chicago high  rise project in a predominantly black neighborhood  the show depicted what black people were going through with a landlord  black agent mr . bookman  as well as prices and the day  to  day problems of just existing .  br    br   the  children depicted how people seem to face their problems differently  from the comical jj to the militant ralph carter  to their daughter who also aspired to attain success  this show was a perfect description of african  american life .  ,1
i think i usually approach film festival comedies with the low expectation that they will invariably be  quirky   and that any intended humor will be derived solely at the expense of the characters  simplicity in the face of a complicated context . what was exceptional about big bad swim was that the director was able to maintain the integrity and development of his characters in his film while still finding laugh  out  loud humor in scene after scene . there was a sophistication  maybe due also in part to the sharp work of the dp  i  ve rarely seen in an indie film  and even more rarely in a comedy . of special note here paget brewster  s turn as amy the math teacher . after seeing this performance i cannot understand why brewster hasn  t been  discovered  by a larger audience . she brings the necessary mix of anger and likability to the role that really helps this picture reach its potential . this is a terrific work deserving of a larger audience . i look forward to more from the director and this cast   ,1
i went into this film with expectations  from the hype  that it would be insightful and uplifting . certainly something more than a cheap promotional for the band  wilco .   br    br   instead we get a lot of moping and whining about  the process   a dishonorable and no doubt one  sided portrayal of one band members who was kicked out by the prima donna lead singer  songwriter  a gut  wrenching confession by the fallen member  s friend   for like   years   saying the  friendship had run its course   and this whiny  uncompelling story about how one record label  hurt their feelings  by dumping them  only so that the band could immediately get   offers from other labels  oh  the tension . . . not   they tried their best to make it look like it was a strain  but i suspect it was all smoke and mirrors to generate a tragedy that didn  t exist . this doesn  t even take into account the long stretches where we get many of their newest songs shoved at us in full without any storyline  insight or even a decent job at cinematography . the strained attempts at emotional sincerity or reasonable perspective on life made me sick to watch .  br    br   from the film  this band sounds like a bunch of vile little babies who poke around to find a voice they don  t have and think they  re some kind of guardians for the art of music  which they most definitely are not . and i thought the music sucked  and i couldn  t even understand the lyrics due to the mumbling style of the lead singer .  br    br   i give it a     .  ,0
this was a great movie that had a lot of under lying issues . it dealt with issues of rascism and class . but  it also had a message of knowing yourself and taking responsibility for yourself . this movie was very deep it gave the message of that you and only you can control your destiny . it also showed that knowing yourself and being comfortable with who you are is the only way you will ever fit into society . what others think of you is not important . i believe this movie did a wonderful job of showing it . the actors i think were able to convey each character wonderfully . i just thought it was amazing how deep this movie really was . at a just glancing look you wouldn  t see how deep the movie is  but on further look you see the underlining meaning of the movie .  ,1
first let me say the director has some wonderful use of titles in his establishing shots . i really enjoyed them . i really enjoyed this movie but i got to say next to pierce brosnan  greg kinear is pretty lackluster . brosnan melts into this character so well  that it is really hard to remember that this is the same guy that played bond . it also shows his range and depth as an actor . it is kinda of an indie flick and was really nice to see especially with all of the mainstream movies that flood the movies at this time of the year . i found the characters to be well crafted . the twist in the middle i felt was especially good . i also liked how the characters come off realistically . so many times we have in film these caricatures of people that are not really characters but walking  stereotypes . . . i like the different approaches this movie takes . i think of sideways when i think of this movie but i think this is more watchable and a better movie overall . . .  ,1
this is one of the funniest shows i have ever seen . it is really refreshing to watch and i was in stitches many times . i guess there is a social awareness factor to this too which makes it quite interesting . if these were white girls would they get the same reaction  maybe they would  maybe they wouldn  t  the characters know no limits  check my lyrics  and do not exclude anyone from their twisted sense of fun  there are so many funny sketches . my favorites is the bob the builder one . it  s so silly it  s genius . if you like twisted black comedy then this is for you . if you like keeping up appearances it probably isn  t .  non blonde  s is yet another hilarious british bbc comedy shown on tv  it is such a funny show and the characters unleashed on the unsuspecting public are laugh at loud funny  it would be impossible to keep a straight face watching the crazy characters and the reactions of the public  this series easily adds to the excellent comedies being produced   ,1
since starting to read the book this movie is based on  i  m having mixed feelings about the filmed result . i learned some time ago to see the movie adaptation of a book before i read the book  because i found that if i read the book first i was inevitably disappointed in the film . this would undoubtedly have been true here  whereas in the case of atonement  which is probably the best filmed adaptation of a book i  ve ever seen  it would probably not have mattered .  br    br   i  m trying to figure out what the cause is  and i suspect that i have to point my finger squarely at michael cunningham . much as i respect him for the hours  which i have not read but which i saw and was awed by  i cannot escape the feeling that he not so much adapted susan minton  s book as he did take a few of the characters and the basic premise and write his own movie out of it .  br    br   it  s not that i dislike the movie . i actually love the movie  which is why  since i started reading the novel  i  m feeling disturbed about the whole thing . i feel disloyal to ms . minton for enjoying the movie which was so thooughly a departure from her work . reading it  i can understand why she had such a struggle adapting it . unlike what one reviewer of the movie said  it  s not so much that some novels don  t deserve to be a movie it  s more like some books just can  t make the transition . ms . minton  s novel operates on a level so personal and intimate to her central character  so internally  that it seems impossible to me to place it in a physical realm . even though a lot of the book is memory of real events  it is memory  and so fragmented and ethereal as to be  i feel  not filmable . i think that ms . minton  s work is a real work of literature  but cannot make the transition to film  which in no way detracts from its value .  br    br   i cannot yet report that evening  the film  does not represent evening  the novel  in any more than the most superficial way  since i  m only halfway through  but the original would have to make a tremendous leap to resemble the film that follows at this point . i guess i  m writing this because i feel that if you  re going to adapt a novel  adapt it  but don  t make it something else that it  s not . i  m not sure if michael cunningham has done anything wholly original  but from what i can see so far the things he has done are all based on someone else  s work . we would not have the hours if virginia woolf had not written mrs . dalloway  and we would not have evening  in its distressed form  if susan minton had not had so much trouble doing what probably should not have been attempted in the first place . but it  s too much to say that it would be better if ms . minton had left well enough alone  because evening  the film  is a satisfactory and beautiful work of its own .  br    br   thus my confusion  mixed feelings  sense of disloyalty  and ultimate conclusion that  in this case  the novel cannot be the film and vice versa  and my eventual gratitude to both writers for doing what they did  so that we have both works as they are .  ,1
  birth of the beatles   for being a us television movie  released in the fall of     has actually been  so far the best movie which tells the tale of the the four lads from liverpool that revolutionized the music industry and the world . as told by the point of view of former beatle pete best . the performance from the entire cast is excellent but  most especially the performance by stephen mackenna as john lennon and rod culbertson as paul mccartney . the film was produced by a legend of the rock and roll era  mr dick clark . who a year earlier in     had produced another tv movie  that has stood the test of time starring  kurt rusell  in the lead role about another musical legend  elvis  . that movie was directed by an unknown director named  john carpenter  who went on to direct other successful movies such as  halloween    escape from new york   and  the thing  . the same can be said for the director of the  birth of the beatles   mr richard marquand . he went on to direct other theatrical blockbusters such as  star wars return of the jedi    eye of the needle   and  jagged edge  among many . the only other film that tells the story of the fab four that i know of  is back beat which had a theatrical release in     . however  the critics did not care for it  nor did the public  for it did not have a long life span in the theater . birth of the beatles is very charming and simplistic film that gives you the essence of the beginning of the legend and the struggles  hardships they went thru and ends at there pinnacle of success when they arrive in nyc and appear in the ed sullivan show in     . i highly recommend this film .  ,1
i must say  i was surprised with the quality of the movie . it was far better than i expected . scenario and acting is quite good . the director made a good job as well . although some scenes look a bit clumsy  it is a decent movie overall . the idea was definitely brilliant and the truth did not reveal itself till the very end . the mental hospital atmosphere was given quite good . the plot was clear  consistent and well thought . some people may find it a bit boring though since the story line is very focused and they take their time for character and story development . moral of the story  it is a decent movie for its genre and it is astonishingly good .  ,1
this film was choppy  incoherent and contrived . it was also an extremely mean  spirited portrayal of women . i rented it because it was listed as a comedy  that  s a stretch   and because the cover said andie mcdowell was acting up a storm in it . she wasn  t . i  m a gal  i watched this film with two guys  and we spent an hour afterwards exclaiming over how bad it was .  br    br   warning plot summary below  rampant spoilers   br    br   the movie starts out with a fairly hackneyed plot about an older woman who takes up with a younger man  to the severe disapproval of her two jealous single girlfriends . they want her to marry a boring guy their own age who is kind of in love with her . but she  s so happy with her oversexed puppy that you  re rooting for them to stick it out  and sure enough  she decides to marry the guy . but her harpy girlfriend  aided by the wishy  washy one  sets up a plot to trick our heroine into thinking the guy is cheating on her . it works . she has a fight with him  he runs out of the house and is crushed by a truck  remember the movie  s title   so now he  s dead  two  thirds of the way through the film . and although our heroine is a school headmistress who spends her time watching over girls  she apparently forgot to use birth control and is pregnant .  br    br   she  s already broken off relations with her girlfriends  because they were so unsupportive . alone and pitiful  she decides to marry the boring guy . did i mention that the boring guy who kind of loves her is a minister  she had asked him to marry her to the young guy  nice  huh    but now she tells him she  ll marry him  and apparently he has no objections to being dicked around in this fashion . but her girlfriends rescue her at the altar and take her home  where they not  quite  confess that they were mostly responsible for the love of her life getting smushed . she has the kid . in the final scene  they leave it in a crib inside her house while they go out on the porch to drink  smoke and be smug . i kid you not  it  s that bad . i left out the part about the cancer red  herring and the harpy  s ridiculous lesbian moment .  ,0
i just saw the third week of stephen kings  nightmares and dreamscapes mini series meaning  i saw  episodes so far . i have to say that the stories are really weak . i have read stephen king  s skeleton crew  a collection of his short stories that was published way back . i recall most of the stories were average to poor but there was one that was really excellent  if not outstanding .  br    br   what i  m trying to say is that just because this mini series is from a collection of stories from stephen king does not mean that it will be any good . in fact  if his previous collection of short stories are of any indication  then most of this mini series will be average to poor .  br    br   in stephen king  s defense  i have not read these new short stories . perhaps they are good as stories in a book and not readily adaptable to television  or perhaps it was the fault of the scriptwriters in trying to write an interesting script . who knows . also  these short stories may have been made exclusively for this mini series and not not for print purpose . maybe that may have been the problem . if stephen king had submitted these crap stories to an editor  i am sure the editor would have immediately told him to make it more interesting because as is  it is simply boring .  br    br   what is clear from all of this is that the problem is with the stories  script and not the actors and actresses because this mini series has some excellent people acting on it .  br    br   seeing this mini series really makes me appreciate those old  twilight zone  series . each series was only half an hour but it was compelling and riveting . i don  t understand why this mini series could not accomplish similar feat . i am sure this mini series had a good deal of money to make a good mini series but unfortunately  something must not have clicked .  br    br   for instance  this week there were two episodes shown . the first involved a horror story writer who buys a picture drawn by an artist who committed suicide . the writer begins to see changes in the picture as he is driving homeward . feeling uncomfortable  he throws away the painting but it keeps appearing near him . also  the portrait of an individual in that picture is killing people and is out to kill him .  i will not even mention the second episode for this week involving criminals and their loot because it was even more boring than this episode    br    br   this premise is interesting and so the story should be good but after seeing it  i was frustrated because there were too many gaps in the story as well as extraneous materials that was shown that did nothing to help the story . after the last scene  i was left with more questions than answers .  br    br   i tried for  weeks to get into this mini series but it was just too aggravating due to poor stories  script . if this was a movie  i would have recommended that people should wait for the movie to come out on cable or such . i would not even recommend that it be rented in your video store . however  given that this is on tnt  a cable channel  i would say if you have not seen it already  then try it for one week . if you do not like it that week  then you will not like the past series nor the future ones  since they all share the same boring trait .  ,0
in     brad pitt and juiliette lewis did a tv too young to die where both played the almost the same kind of parts that they do in kalifornia . i have no doubt that is what led to their casting in this big screen film .  br    br   kalifornia finds aspiring writer david duchovny and his girl friend  art photographer michelle forbes on a rocky relationship of sorts due to duchovny  s obsession with writing a book and getting in the minds and souls of serial killers . in fact he  s got a most unusual odyssey planned  he wants to go cross country and visit the sites of several famous serial killers . but he and forbes are flat broke .  br    br   fate intervenes in more ways than financial with the arrival of brad pitt and juliette lewis a pair of strange southern types who agree to split the cost of gas on this cross country trip . it turns out pitt is a serial killer himself and he decides to do a little research on his own  delving into the mind of someone who is fascinated with amorality .  br    br   kalifornia is not the type of film i usually go for  but in fact the acting ability and charisma of brad pitt make it work to a large degree . pitt is the walking definition of an inbred gothic refugee from deliverance . but better than he is is juliette lewis who once again is playing these low self esteem types which she seems to do well . watch her scene with forbes as she does her hair and lewis describes her sad and pathetic life . lewis  s dialog and forbes  s reactions ought to be shown in acting classes around the country .  br    br   for those who like their slasher flicks  they don  t come better than kalifornia .  ,1
and that is the only reason i posses this dvd . now i haven  t seen the first nemesis film  but i did check the info out of it and i here by say what  why  because in the first film alex was male . but then again the first one was set in the future  so maybe this alex is brand new one and the scientist just happened to make alex female this time . who knows  at least it wasn  t addressed in the film in any way .  br    br   here  s a quick summary of the plot alex  still a baby then  or how ever you want  as it was  is  in the future  escapes with her mom using a special time vessel and ends up in the    s africa . there mommy gets killed and alex  sue price  grows up in a african tribe . then the tribe gets slaughtered by a cyborg from the future and alex then runs and hides and finally she kills the cyborg . so there . does sound familiar  doesn  t it  .  br    br   terminator isn  t the only film being ripped here  predator gets its fair share too and i think the first fly movie  the vincent price one  gets special nomination for giving a solid base to build up your cyborgs head from .  br    br   lets see  what else  okay  the film was quite standard small budget flick  but it did have bad special effects for a mid    s film . it would have looked okay for a    s flick how ever . biggest problem is the plot . things just happen and the viewer is barely interested . nemesis  isn  t the crappiest piece of cinema i  ve had pleasure    to watch but it does come damn close .  br    br   i won  t say a thing about acting  because let  s be honest here did anyone expect oscar worthy performances here  oh well . . . at least i did find sue price hot in that amazonian warrior way .  br    br   a  real  movie rating     there isn  t a lot of pros about the over all quality . and despite of the very basic plot the film it self makes very little sense .  br    br   a camp movie rating     i did get occasional laughs from the sheer badness of the film  so it does have small merits in it .  ,0
i rented this movie because it falls under the genres of  romance  and  western  with some grand canyon scenery thrown in . but if you  re expecting a typical wholesome romantic western  forget it . this movie is pure trash  the romance is between a young girl who has not even gone through puberty and a middle  aged man  the child is also lusted after by other leering men . it  s sickening .  br    br   peter fonda is portrayed as being virtuous by trying to resist his attraction to brooke shields  and her character is mostly the one that pursues the relationship . he tries to shoo her off at first but eventually he gives in and they drive off as a happy  loving couple . it  s revolting .  br    br   i don  t see how this movie could appeal to anyone except pedophiles .  ,0
i bought this dvd for   and now i realise why . the acting was the worst i  ve seen in a long time . the lighting and sound are shoddy at best . the plot makes little sense even when sober  warning i don  t advise watching this film when sober .  this film feels like you  re watching the home movie of someone who doesn  t get out much . it really is a shame that all the very little money spent on this project went to such a waste  i look forward to seeing if any of those envoled still have a career  other than eva longoria who is the only  star  of this film that was apparently not hit with the bad acting stick . i  m sorry that none of this criticism seems constructive but i will say one thing to james cahill  don  t try it again . in the words of squirlyem  its severely lacking in the good department  .  ,0
this batman movie isn  t quite as good as batman mask of the phantasm and batman and mr . freeze subzero but it is still a good installment to the batman cartoons i say it is equally good as batman beyond the movie . this movie is good for all the same reasons the storyline is good not quite as good as the other one  s but still pretty good it has lots of action in it the cartoon effects are good the voice of actors are really good such as kevin conroy as batman  bruce wayne  tara strong as barbra gordon  efrem zimbalist jr .  eli marienthal as robin . the villains are good such as kyra sedgwick as batwoman  david ogden stiers as the pequin  hector elizondo as bane . so i am sure you will not be disappointed with batman mystery of the batwomen . so make sure that you rent or buy batman mystery of the batwoman the movie because it is really good .  br    br   overall score  out of   br    br    out of   ,1
i  ve never been impressed by jd anyway  and final justice  which i hadn  t seen prior to its mst  k airing  proves to be no exception . it  s not that the character is any less likeable than mitchell it  s just that there  s less that geronimo   call me  heronimo   to dislike .  br    br   in fact  one suspects that mitchell and final justice were all schemes of a revenge  seeking agent of joe don  s trying to get the  star  killed by inducing a heart attack .  br    br   joe don must have found a new agent  since he  s now graduated to  comic relief  in james bond movies . the problem is  it  s hard to tell the difference between his comedy characters there  and his  serious  characters in his action  movies like this one .  br    br   as for the plot . . . umm  what plot  they repeat the same set pieces so repeatedly you  ll think you were watching groundhog  s day  . presumably  the fact they keep using the same scene of geronimo getting out of jail is supposed to be comic relief of some sort . ummm  yeah  whatever .  br    br   on the plus side  the malta scenery is pretty gorgeous  so that kicked it up to a  for me . one suspects this flick set maltese tourism back a couple of decades  though .  ,0
if you can imagine mickey mouse as a new york street pimp  or john wayne as a communist spy  then you might believe pat boone as a juvenile delinquent on his uncle  s farm in kentucky and you could conceivably enjoy this movie .  br    br   this film is so stupid that it isn  t even campy for a mid     s sexless love story . and the problem is that hollywood made such a big deal about pat boone  s refusal to kiss a woman not his wife on screen before its release that the audience knows he won  t kiss shirley jones so you cannot build any anticipation for the  screen consummation  of their love . it  s sort of like watching a western in which the cowboys don  t have guns .  br    br   the story is pointless . even the title song is sung with pained enthusiasm .  br    br   april love belongs in the worst film bargain bin along with ishtar and plan  from outer space .  ,0
it was extremely low budget  it some scenes it looks like they recorded with a home video recorder  . however it does have a good plot line  and its easy to follow .  years after shooting her sexually abusive step father amanda is released from the psychiatric ward  with the help of her doctor who she is secretly having an affair with . the doctor ends up renting her a house and buying her a car . but within the first   minutes of the movie amanda kills him and buries him in her backyard . then she see  s her neighbor richard sets eyes on him and stops at nothing until she has him . she acts innocent but after another neighbor buzz finds out that amanda killed that doctor and attempted to kill richards wife laurie  this is after amanda and him get it on in the hot tub  . then she stops acting so innocent and kills buzz and later on attempts to kill richard whom she supposedly loves and cares for . and you  ll have to rent the movie to find out if amanda dies or not . overall good movie  reminds me a lot of my life you know the whole falling for the neighbor and stopping at nothing until you have him part .  ,1
sean  you know i think that you are absolutely the greatest actor in the world  but i can  t commend you for this . comedy just isn  t your strong suit .  br    br   however  it wasn  t all your fault . some of the stuff was just too hard to understand . alfred lynch did a decent job  but you gotta wonder where the lines came from from the beginning .  br    br   once again  sean . . . i apologize .  ,0
daphne zuniga is the only light that shines in this sleepy slasher  and the light fades quickly . if not her  than what other reason to watch this . five college kids are signed up to prepare an old dorm for its due date of demolition . problems are automatically occurring when a weird homeless man is soliciting  and the group are short a few people . then  a killer is on the loose . i honestly wanted to say i was going to enjoy this one . it had a fair set up  or maybe that was just daphne zuniga in it . the film is too slow  and almost as silent as a library . most of the acting is below average  and the  point  of  view  moments are so old news . acclaimed composer christopher young of such films as  hellraiser  and  entrapment  scored this  in a repetitive cue line that was better made for a tv movie . still  it seems higher than the movie deserves . so  other than young and zuniga  this one scrapes the bottom of the barrel .  ,0
i always felt that a good film should have a plot . this particular film was missing one  and i feel that it would have been more effective with a plot . this was made even worse by the fact that it seemed to go on forever i was anxious for it to finally end . however  i just noticed that it was only    minutes long it felt like four hours . not only was there no plot but the film also lacked a notable conflict . it  s not the worst movie i  ve seen  but i used to say that it was until i saw  the fast and the furious  . so  don  t think this review of mine is from someone who needs nothing but action . i actually hate most action films out today it  s just that this film is all the way on the other side of the spectrum . not much really happens in this movie . however  the scenery and costumes were nice .  ,0
this is the perfect example of something great going awfully bad . . . hence  can i advice anyone to watch it  well  i was kinda obliged by the fact that in was in the tiff competition  i still can  t believe it won  . . and i only remained until the end because the director was there for a qa section . . but that was also anything but interesting . . what  s it about  well the first half  the worth watching one  presents three characters a hooker  a musician and some kind of official . . the first two lie about their professions . . but the third is the actual liar . . the second half  do something else . . don  t ruin a good evening  includes some old breasts and heavy drinking . . but maybe you will see it completely different . . . the tiff jury did  were they drinking vodka    ,0
i had never seen richard thomas play a bad guy . i wasn  t sure i would like him this way . and i wasn  t sure he could pull it off . but this astounded me . he sent shivers up my spine and caused me to take a closer look at street people . the movie is engrossing and fast paced . bruce davison is convincing but all he can really play is a nice guy . the real talent here is thomas . the ending was a little clumsy but perhaps that  s the way real people would fight . . . if you are a thomas fan you must see him here at his best being bad   ,1
richard dreyfuss stars in  moon over parador   a     paul mazursky film also starring raul julia  sonia braga  jonathan winters and charo . dreyfuss plays a new york actor  jonathan nolan  in the caribbean country of parador to make a film . when the dictator dies suddenly  the secret police chief  julia  who is the one actually controlling the dictator and the country  drafts jonathan to play the dictator  having noticed the resemblance between them . soon jonathan is ensconced in the palace as alphonse simms  and simms  prostitute girlfriend madonna  braga  who realizes the switch promises to help him in any way she can .  br    br   mazursky  who appears in drag as simms  mother  gives us a look at how the cia operates in third world countries . the winters character  supposedly a salesman  is actually a cia operative . the film  however  flirts with but doesn  t really tread on very serious ground and is more of a send  up  and a funny one at that .  br    br   richard dreyfuss does a fabulous job as jonathan the actor and alphonse the dictator  creating two separate characters and nailing both . the gorgeous sonia braga is great as madonna  and raul julia hands in a wickedly funny performance as strausmann  the man behind the dictator . it  s one of those performances where you never quite know what the character is thinking  he can be pleasant or turn psycho at any moment . charo is on hand as a maid and manages to be funny and unobtrusive at the same time .  br    br   a very good film  not a big blockbuster  but very entertaining .  ,1
i simply could not finish this movie . i tuned out after what i would say is my nomination for the most wretched attempt at sexual suggestion award a scene in which pia zadora  at a picnic  stands between two boys who want her . one  the good boy  pleads for her to see the error of her ways . the other  the bad boy  simply asks if she  d like a hot dog  which he then holds out for her . at crotch level . i hope i  m not spoiling anything to say she turns  and takes the hot dog  with a smile . just pathetic .  ,0
this is seriously one of the worst movies i have ever seen . i love japanese movies  and i think another film by the same director  electric dragon       v  is a masterpiece . i really wanted to like this movie  asano is a terrific actor and the storyline was immensely appealing . but i couldn  t find anything entertaining about it .  br    br   the movie takes forever for nothing to happen . and the effects the director used  like the constant percussion and the exorbitant use of slow motion  merely added to my growing annoyance at the fact that the plot was so mind  bogglingly slow and the actors were heinously overacting . a lot of the boredom was a result of extraneous additions that were completely unnecessary  like an hour spent on asano going around slicing buddha statues and proclaiming how he doesn  t worship anything . this added nothing to the plot . a fellow japanese film buff and i were both checking the time constantly . we couldn  t believe this film was as terrible as it was . and the finale was awful . i thought the director would at least attempt to reward the viewer for managing to sit through this  but sadly i was mistaken .  ,0

  ruby in paradise  is a beautiful  coming  of  age story about a young woman  ruby lee gissing  escaping her stifling roots to become herself . although the title character is played artfully by the gorgeous ashley judd   in likely her first movie role  albeit one to be quite proud of   the emphasis is not upon becoming  somebody   a la the next madonna  whether jesus  mother or the lurid  attention  hungry singer  .  br    br   it instead emphasizes following ones  instincts and being somewhat introspective about them  to grow into one  s ideal  adult self . note this isn  t an action movie    it uses an occasional voice  over narration  by ms . judd  while writing in her journal   and oh  i see i  ve just lost the male half of the readers out there . but be patient with this beautiful movie  where we learn that one  s bliss can be discovered in   oh  i dunno  carrying water and chopping wood .  br    br   actor  director  writer todd field  who played nick nightingale in  eyes wide shut   co  stars as ruby lee  s noble love interest  one who helps her heal her idea of relationships implanted from youth .  br    br   but not even his character is the answer for ruby lee there  s no external hero imposed upon her . the ultimate message is that we are responsible for ourselves . writer  director victor nunez  who also wrote  directed  ulee  s gold   did an amazing job showing a young woman growing into herself   confronting age  old challenges of good v . evil along the way .  br    br   the supporting cast is also stellar  and the music used  particularly the cuts by chanteuse sam phillips  whom i hear is the wife of t . bone burnett   is right on   most especially  trying to hold on to the earth .  now  when i hear the first few chords of that song  tears spring to my eyes  pavlovian and unbidden   not sure if it  s the music  or the indelible connection to the movie  s quiet  charming message of empowerment .  br    br   this movie is highly recommended for any young person trying to find his  her way . for any woman of any age  it is a must see  the downside it is not on dvd  except in spanish .  we learned  however  that it is legal to make one copy of a vhs version  which can be readily found online . my beloved husband found someone with a vhs copy and got a dvd copy made for me .  although this treasure of a movie occasionally pops up on  air  on an indie channel  usually  you can  t count on that when you might need it most as a tonic to soothe the pressures of the world . so buy a copy for yourself .  br    br   this movie should have a major re  release  and it would  if i were queen of hollywood .  br    br     figgy jones  ,1
eric stoltz delivers an extraordinary performance as joel garcia  a successful young novelist who winds up paralyzed and in a special hospital for the recently disabled after breaking his neck in a hiking accident . while learning to cope and adjust with the gravity of his new limited physical condition joel befriends slick  fast  talking  charming womanizer raymond  an amazing wesley snipes  and boorish  surly  racist biker bloss  a terrific william forsythe   who feels threatened by the diverse multi  ethnic array of fellow patients he  s forced to share a room with . joel also receives substantial support from his loyal and loving  but married girlfriend anna  radiantly played by helen hunt  . but he still must come to terms with being disabled on his own .  br    br   this remarkable movie  s key triumph is its laudably stubborn refusal to neither sanitize nor sentimentalize the severity of what these men are going through . directors neil jimenez  who also wrote the thoughtful and insightful script  and micheal steinberg relate the story with exceptional taste  wit and warmth  specifically addressing with disarming candor and matter  of  factness how being handicapped irrevocably alters one  s lifestyle  including and especially your sex life  this point is most powerfully made in a striking sequence when joel and anna try and fail to make love in a motel room  . besides the expected poignancy  the film further provides a surprising surplus of wickedly funny raw  earthy humor that  s highlighted by the uproarious sequence with joel and bloss making a secret nocturnal expedition to a strip club . the uniformly superb acting qualifies as another significant plus stoltz  snipes  forsythe and hunt are all outstanding  with stand  out supporting turns by grace zabriskie as bloss  doting  amiable mother and elisabeth pena and william allen young as compassionate hospital nurses . despite the grim subject matter  the film ultimately proves to be a very moving  positive and uplifting cinematic testament to the astonishing strength and durability of the human spirit . a simply wonderful little gem of a drama .  ,1
generally i don  t like films directed by sydney pollack   the firm  being somewhat of an exception  and i  ve never been a robert redford fan either . still  i thought  three days of the condor  must be good because of the number of praising comments it has received .  br    br   although the widescreen cinematography is quite pleasing for the eye and max von sydow does a nice job as the sinister professional killer  i found the whole affair tremendously disappointing . the film undeniably radiates paranoid atmosphere  but everything is ruined by the muddled plot which doesn  t seem to make any sense .  br    br   the film also contains one of the most unsatisfying endings i have ever seen which really leaves the viewer hanging in the air . and what can one say about that absurd romance between redford and dunaway  i  d much rather watch any of hitchcock  s films five times in succession than to sit through this piece of waste once more .  ,0
enjoyed catching this film on very late late late tv and it kept my interest through out the entire picture . this wonderful creepy  yet mysterious looking english home  with evil looking decorations and weired furniture and rooms that make you wonder just why anyone would want to rent this home or even own it . there are four    tales concerning this house  and each resident of the home meets with all kinds of problems . you will notice the beautiful lake and pond around the home and also the sweet singing of birds  but don  t let that fool you  there is horror all over the place . peter cushing   black jack      gives a great performance as one of the person  s living in the home and even christopher lee   curse of the crimson altar     and his little daughter  chloe franks   jane reid  make a wonderful exciting story together  his daughter for some reason loves to read witchcraft books  if you love creepy  horrible and mysterious films  with lots of surprises  this is the film for you      ,1

when i read the back of the dvd case  i thought that it sounded really interesting . . . so . . . i had my mom throw it into the pile of movies in the   for   dollars  section at blockbuster . when we got home and popped in the movie . . . twenty minutes into it  we found ourselves turning to each other going  this sucks . let  s put in something else .  i  ll admit  a few of the lines from the friends at the caf made us smile a little bit . but come on  at least get some decent actors  every once in a while in a movie  if the acting is bad and the movie isn  t going at a painfully slow pace and actually seems interesting  i can gut it out and get a few laughs at how they  re over  or under  doing their lines . but i can only take so much . crying scenes looked like the actors were having hysterical fits of laughter  there was no delivery for their lines . . . amateur doesn  t even come close to the acting in this film .  br    br   anyone who came on here saying that this film was good had to have been on some really good drugs while they were watching the movie . it  s the most pointless thing i  ve ever had the displeasure of watching . do not watch or buy this movie       ,0
a very cheesy and dull road movie  with the intention to be hip and modern  shown in the editing style and some weird camera angles  resulting only in sleepiness .  br    br   the cast is wasted  the writing is stupid and pretentious . the only thing worthwhile is the top  notch lalo schifrin  s soundtrack  really cool and also the opening sequence  very original and interesting .  br    br   run if you can  the bad opinions and comments about this flick are totally deserved it is really pure garbage . of course that this has its charm  of watching a movie which everybody would not drop the beer glass on if it were on fire  but save it for a stormy day where you have absolutely nothing else to do .  ,0
it begins on a nice note only to falter quickly and let down expectations .  br    br   mac  akshay kumar  and sam  s  john abraham  characters are not properly built before mac  s boss decides to hitch him with three air hostess . rest of the drama is about how mac  sam and uncle mambo  paresh rawal  deal with situations which at times seem forced .  br    br   about the cast  paresh rawal is a very talented actor  i thought was wasted in the role of a moody cook . akshay kumar is tolerable  john abraham is very bad keeps stumbling over furniture  rajpal yadav is the only saving grace in the movie .  br    br   the second half of the movie is funny at times  but in all a dud  songs are boring  and a major let down if you are hoping for some wholesome entertainment and comedy .  ,0
  pet sematary  succeeds on two major situations . first  it  s a scary horror movie . those that just aren  t produced in these days . second  it  s an emotional  clever movie overall . so if you are looking for chills  scares  creepiness and visually stunning settings  great acting  dialongs  and gruesome effects this is the movie you are looking for . a classic now and truly a must see for any horror fan .  br    br   probably  the best adaptation to any of king  s novels . the events feel a little rushed compared with the novel  but that doesn  t means that this underrated movie isn  t a complete horror  drama accomplishment .  br    br   stephen king  s novel is widely known for being very emotional and gruesome at the same time . the movie captures the same feeling mainly because there  s a great character development and you can feel the loving relationship between it  s members . then  when everything seems to be happiness  technically happy  because the title  pet sematary  does not offers appiness   a tragic event changes the movie  s atmosphere  now it turns very dark . the movie has a sinister feeling since the opening credits  but after gage is killed the movie becomes sad  gray  creepy . dealing with the loss of a baby son is something that can ruin a family  s entire life  and  pet sematary  proves it dramatically .  br    br   the legend behind the pet sematary is more than a myth that no one wants to experience  but sadness and desperation lead an emotionally destroyed father to give it a shot . sadly enough  the legend comes true and baby gage returns from the dead . the previous encounter with the pet sematary legend turned out to be a tragedy but this time it  s something much  much worse . what will happened with the lives of our all american family  could pascow prevent this tragedy  what is it with the surreal nightmares   br    br   watch  pet sematary  to witness one of the most touching  emotional horror movies of recent times . you won  t regret . the acting is very good although i didn  t dig the actor who portrayed the father . he didn  t seem disturbed enough when the situations asked for his desperation . but that  s just my opinion . denise crosby truly delivered a great performance and worked perfect as the noble  tender mother . baby gage was amazing even on his creepy parts . shivers . overall this is a great classic of all time and a disturbing movie that touches people  s deepest fears . . . the loss of someone you love  the dead returning to life  and a feeling of desperation .  br    br   something is for sure . . . i don  t wanna be buried  in a pet sematary    ,1
slow  boring  extremely repetitive . no wonder the weinstein company did not buy this . this spurlock should eat more mcdonalds while filming himself  and quit producing . there is no way you can watch this and enjoy . the preacher is a joke . the whole idea is not funny . you can make a  minute film with this idea not a feature . i am so sorry i rented this movie . i will never watch anything with the name spurlock on it . it is completely garbage . filmmakers like this should be on youtube and never be granted a distribution deal . the film states that the american consumers and their shopping are at fault for the current depression when shopping and buying products  making money circulate in the system are the base of a healthy economy .  ,0

this movie is now my gauge against which all other movies will be compared . . . as in   was it as stupid as revolver   i too was in the toronto international film festival audience last night where a room filled with over     people walked out in an eerie silence after being absolutely dumbstruck by  hours of sheer nonsense . jason stratham would have been amazing if only he had a purpose . within the first   minutes he  s given a proposition by andre     and big pussy  of soprano  s fame  which makes no sense at all  then there  s some shooting and then there  s ray liotta wearing embarrassing bikini briefs  then there  s some animation  ray liotta  s naked butt  lots of shooting  teeth gnashing  art house wanna be pretensions and more of liotta  s embarrassing body that elicited laughs at every showing . . . which i  m not quite sure was the reaction he was looking for . . . not  times anyway . everyone in this movie thinks they  re smarter than the average bear and guy ritchie thinks he  s yogi bear incarnate . the story lines might have went nowhere but the posturing was outta sight  the only way this movie could have been worse is if madonna herself was in it .  ,0
the young dr . fanshawe  mark letheren   an avid archaeologist  is dispatched by his museum boss to the large country home of squire richards  pip torrens   where his task is to find provenance for and catalogue the collection of antiquities and curios belonging to the recently deceased father of the squire . the squire is surprised by the arrival fanshawe  he hadn  t been expecting him for another week  but none the less welcomes him and gets his only servant  patten  david burke . . of dr watson fame   to show him to his room  as fanshawe must stay over for some days in order to finish his rather large task . patten it would seem is not the friendliest sort and seems to resent the extra work that fanshawe  s visit will entail  the large empty house providing an endless amount of cooking  cleaning and maintenance for him . fanshawe is a fussy sort  very neat and precise with everything having its place  whether they be his clothes or his books and papers and he is rather disgusted by the dirt in his room . needless to say he is rather eager to begin his work  but unpacking he finds his binoculars have been damaged in transit  so he asks the squire for a replacement pair  the squire who is a modern thinking man but also it would seem rather uncultured with such matters  is also eager to get rid of the clutter around the house  so he obliges and walks fanshawe to the top of the hill so that he can survey the estate and the surrounding villages  there the squire directs him to points of interest  including gallows hill  where locals were hung for their crimes and misdemeanours  his interest is also taken by a local abbey which the squire describes as a ruin  but fanshawe can see through the binoculars that it clearly isn  t  he investigates further and pays a visit to the site of the abbey and is shocked to find that there are but a few stone remnants  fanshawe doesn  t have too much time to think about this conundrum as he darkness falls he feels he is being watched  he feels a presence  he begins to see moving shadows in the woods  startled he runs home . over dinner he imparts details of his harrowing day to the squire  patten overhears the story and suggests an explanation for it . . the binoculars  they used to belong to a local man called baxter  whom it would seem collected bones and skulls from gallows hill  boiling them up for some concoction or other  baxter had disappeared mysteriously one night  the late squire had acquired his belongings  including a mask made out of a skull and some old etchings of the area . these etchings fascinate fanshawe as they portray the abbey he seen through his binoculars  but he learns that the abbey had been destroyed during the reign of henry vii and so it would be impossible for baxter to have drawn the sketches  never the less they are signed and dated by baxter to the recent past so he concludes that the binoculars have some special power . that night he has horrifically vivid dreams  when he wakes  he sets off with the binoculars to have a closer look at the abbey through them  what he finds surprises him but has he put himself in perilous danger by doing so  fanshawe finally becomes trapped in his dangerous obsession  as darkness falls the squire and a search party go in search of the now missing archaeologist  they are alerted by dozens of loudly cawing crows circling above gallows hill  they quicken their speed  but will they be in time to help or save fanshawe from his destiny  the ghost story for christmas series of films made by the bbc sadly ended its initial run of films in     with the ice house  they were for the most part based on the work of the great m . r . james . in     and     the series was revived briefly and thankfully a view from a hill also marked a return to the work of james  whose ghostly writings have haunted many generations of readers . director luke watson being new to the series might have worried fans of the older films  but he returns to the period setting abandoned by the later films which immediately sets the tone for a great ghost story  his direction is assured as he stays true to the mood of the masters works and gradually builds up the fear factor to a terrifying climax  all the while keeping what the viewer sees to a minimum  thus upping the tension and mystery . the autumn countryside provides oodles of atmosphere  the falling leaves and low lying sun providing an unsettling backdrop for the sinister events to come . the cast it must be said are all superb and are perfectly cast in their respective roles . the idea behind the binoculars is simple but very effective  the use of a man made object to see supernatural beings and events that the naked eye cannot see  may even have influenced lex de la iglesia in his film la habitacin del nio       of the following year  with which it bears striking similarity . i had heard mixed reviews of this particular film  but i must say i found it at all times intriguing and it even raised a few hairs on my head and gave me a few shivers  something that doesn  t happen much these days  i think any negativity surrounding the film can only be attributed to its pacing  which to my eyes is perfection but to modern audiences it will be seen as deathly slow . plenty of time is given  even within its brief   minutes running time  for character development and plot expansion and i must say its a new favourite of mine and certainly one of the better films of the decade .  ,1
excellent film dealing with the life of an old man as he looks back over the years . starting around      he reminisces about his boy and young adulthood his family  friends  romances  etc . very nostalgic piece with a bittersweet finale . . . .  all things in life come together as one  and a river runs through it . and that river haunts me .  worth seeing .  ,1
  scoop  is easily woody allen  s funniest film of the      s so far . allen  although finally looking his age  is at the top of his game as low  brow magician sidney waterman . his one  liners and demeanor are hilarious . don  t let the critics sway your opinion .  scoop  is a top notch  woody  lite  picture .  br    br   the classical music score is an excellent compliment to the action on screen . scarlett johanson looks gorgeous in that bathing suit . jackman is dashing . the cinematography glows .  scoop  is wonderful escapist fare from start to finish . the last shot of the film alone is worth the admission price .  ,1
sorry everyone    i know this is supposed to be an  art  film   but wow  they should have handed out guns at the screening so people could blow their brains out and not watch . although the scene design and photographic direction was excellent  this story is too painful to watch . the absence of a sound track was brutal . the loooonnnnng shots were too long . how long can you watch two people just sitting there and talking  especially when the dialogue is two people complaining . i really had a hard time just getting through this film . the performances were excellent  but how much of that dark  sombre  uninspired  stuff can you take  the only thing i liked was maureen stapleton and her red dress and dancing scene . otherwise this was a ripoff of bergman . and i  m no fan f his either . i think anyone who says they enjoyed     hours of this is   well  lying .  ,0
philip . k . dickian movie . and a decent one for that matter . better than the paycheck  woo  and that abomination called minority report  spielberg  . but lets face it  the twisting and cheesing ending was a bit too much for me . half way through the movie i already started to fear about such kind of ending  and i was regrettably right . but that does not mean that the film is not worth its time . no  not at all . first half  as already many here have commented  is awesome . there are some parts where you start to doubt whether the director intended to convey the message that showmanship is highly important thing in the future  we will do such kind on corny sf things because we can  or is it simply over combining . but the paranoia is there and feeling  out of joint  also . good one .  ,0
this movie had the potential to be really good  considering some of the plot elements are borrowed from the sci  fi actioner the hidden . and dolph always lends some cheesy appeal to his roles . but someone somewhere really dropped the ball on this one .  br    br   dolph plays a butt  kicking monk    who travels to new york to retrieve a key that unlocks a door beneath his monastery that has imprisoned the antichrist for     years . he must battle the minion  who is a spirit that jumps from body to body much like the hidden and jason goes to hell . the minion  naturally  wants the key so it can let the antichrist out . along for the ride is an annoying female archaeologist and together she and dolph are chased by the minion  possessed bodies .  br    br   if i  m making this sound entertaining  forget it . the pacing is very awkward and sluggish  the acting subpar at best  and the fight scenes staged poorly . dolph sleepwalks through his role and spouts some of the worst dialogue of his career .  br    br   the cheese factor really picks up at the end when the minion battles an army of machine  gun wielding monks at the monastery  but the rest of this flick is a snoozefest .  br    br   too bad  i really wanted to like this .  ,0

first an explanation on what makes a great movie for me . excitement about not knowing what is coming next will make me enjoy a movie the first time i watch it  case en point twister  . there are also other things that go into a great first viewing such as good humor  john candy in uncle buck and the great outdoors   good plot with good resolution  madeline and matilda   imaginative storytelling  all star wars episodes  george lucas is the man   and good music  again all star wars episodes  wizard of oz  sound of music  . what makes me watch a movie at least six times in the theatre and buy a dvd or vhs tape  characters . with that said  i present cindy lou who and the grinch . excellent performance taylor momsen and jim carrey . the rest of the cast was very good  particularly jeffery tambor  bill irwin  molly shannon  christine baranski  and josh ryan evans . but  every single scene with cindy and the grinch  together is excellent and very funny and  or heartwarming . cindy lou is my favorite character in this movie and the most compelling reason why the movie is better than the cartoon . the grinch has a strong plot  good conflicts  and a very good theme  i can  t get started because i don  t want to spoil it  . jim carrey was very funny as the grinch  particularly when he interacted with cindy . and the music  wow  excellent music by james horner . i loved his selection of instruments and the compositions . very good job jim carrey  i didn  t know you could sing . taylor momsen  whoa  your voice is reason enough to see the movie at least once . on your solo  where are you christmas  is your voice really as high as it sounds  sounds like an f  that is an obscene range for a   year old  obscene meant in the best possible way  . great job . this is the best performance by a child i have ever heard in a movie  taylor beat out the von trapp children  no small feat   . and now to the actors . jim carrey was great  funny  and  surprisingly very sensitive  this really showed through in his scenes with taylor momsen  . taylor momsen  s unspoken expressions  one of the secrets to a good acting performance  are very strong  she really becomes cindy lou who . and when she does dialogue she is even stronger .  br    br   dangerspoiler alert   br    br   examples expression when she first sees the grinch . this is a classic quote   you  re the the the  and then filled in with the grinch line  da da da the grinch  after which she topples into the sorter and then is rescued by the grinch  . the  thanks for saving me  quote and subsequent response by the grinch was also very good .  br    br   my favorite part of the movie is when cindy invites the grinch to be holiday cheermeister . this scene is two excellent actors at their best interacting and expressing with each other . little taylor momsen completely holds her own with jim carrey in this spot . i sincerely hope we see taylor momsen in many more films to come . all in all everything was great about this movie  except maybe the feet and noses  .  ,1
for a long time i haven  t seen so beautiful animated feature . having healthy respect for pixar  i must say that ratatouille or any other movie made by  em can not be compared to this . animators have created an incredibly beautiful world here . the graphics is amazing  the background surroundings are mind  blowing  almost every object in every frame is drawn perfectly . sometimes i felt tingles down my spine  so much i loved what i  ve seen .  br    br   the plot is absolutely romantic . as romantic as the animated film plot can possibly be . the characters are lovable  especially hector  the blue rabbit  he owns  pawns  rocks and rules  the other char  s are very nice also . the humor is top  notch .  br    br   generally it seemed that creators didn  t invest much effort into this . i mean it looked like it didn  t take em too much in difference from people of pixardreamworks who try hard every time to think on something new . and i  m very glad that a product of european animation studio turned out to be so great . they  ve made a magnificent  touching movie  a candy for eye and heart .  br    br   the only minus is stupid beginning and that  s why it  s  of   not       ,1
if you don  t mind having your emotions toyed with  then you won  t mind this movie . on the other hand  if you enjoy british crime mysteries  following clues and seeing how they all logically fall into place at the end  you  ll be very disappointed .  br    br   here are some of the logical inconsistencies that lead to that disappointment  br    br    while the police utilize the cctv cameras early on to gather clues about the mystery  the huge truck that stopped and blocked the children  s view just before her disappearance doesn  t get caught on camera . this is a critical piece of the mystery . it  s inconsistent to have the car the children were in caught on camera and not the big truck that is so critical to the mystery .  br    br    the movie goes to great lengths to show the sophistication of the equipment in tracking down the children  s movements but misses the opportunity to utilize the same sophisticated equipment is tracking down vehicles that may have entered the crime scene from camera  visible locations adjacent to the crime scene as part of developing clues .  br    br    in england  driving is on the left . the director goes out of his way to have the car at the crime scene park on the right  several meters away from the flower kiosk  when it could have easily parked immediately behind  or even on the side as the huge truck did .  br    br    the police forensics team is so meticulous as to find a discarded cell phone in a sewer drain several miles from the scene of the crime  but can  t find any blood evidence from the head injury right at the crime scene  even though they secured the scene just hours after the disappearance and with no intervening rainfall .  br    br    search dogs were not used at all to find the missing children this from the country that is well known for developing the hound dog for search and hunting .  br    br    it is illogical that such a highly publicized news story would not turn up the presumably innocent truck driver that stopped at the flower kiosk .  br    br    it is illogical that the mother would go to such extremes and expend so much effort to leave carpet fiber clues under her fingernails for her eventual murder investigators even coaxing her daughter to do the same   while she simply could not have crawled out of the unguarded mobile home . if she had enough sense about her to ask her daughter to get carpet fibers under her nails  she could of just as easily asked her daughter to call out for help or even leave the mobile home that was in a crowded residential park .  br    br    the suspect that abducted the little girl was portrayed as mentally slow  dimwitted   justifying his unknowingly drowning of the mother but  he was smart enough not to cooperate with the police and also fully exercise his rights not to self  incriminate .  br    br   there are more inconsistencies like this that will lead to a true sleuth aficionado  s disappointment .  five days  is a very weak british crime story .  ,0

first off  this really is my favorite film ever . i don  t need to give anyone a description because every ahole does that . i am literally obsessed with this practically bloodless  cheesy  lame effects having   boom  stick showing   badly edited     s metal horror masterpiece . the director  i heard  had hoped for a hit at the box office so that he could do sequels and have a freddy  jason type of deal for himself . damn  i wish that could  ve went down like that  the soundtrack  s banging  . the acting  s good . . . . check this mofo out . and any die  hard fans out there  feel free to email and chat sometime . midgetorgy . . . . i can be found at yahoo .  ,1
i was  years old when i saw this musical movie while on vacation with my family in st . thomas in     and immediately fell in love with it .   years later  it is still an original inspiration for achieveing my goals that i have set to accomplish since that time   br    br   this tragic story of a hard  core  behind the scenes  of the entertainment industry during the late    s   sparkle  successfully portrays the struggle of three young sisters looking for their place in the sun . this story could simply become the biographical story of many young aspiring artists about what could materialize when things seem to happen too fast and role models are not available to lend a helping hand .  br    br   the phenomenal music written and composed by aretha franklin and curtis mayfield  the soundtrack carries the plot with every song . from being subjected to situations that almost leave no choice for strong long  term decision  making  to making the ultimate sacrifice in order to get ahead  all three young girls  sparkle  sister  and delores  represent the different routes that one could take when you set out to achieve your ideal opportunity as your contribution to society .  br    br   this movie could have possibly spawned the ideas of creating  dreamgirls  on broadway  and mariah carey  s  glitter     years later . as an original audience member of both productions  i have seen a lot of similarities in both stories to  sparkle   as well as in  saturday night fever    fame    flashdance   and the off  broadway smash hit  mama  i want to sing .   ,1
the week before i saw iowa  i saw art school confidential  in which a pretentious student makes a film and can  t decide whether he wants it to be art or violent exploitation . iowa could be the film that he made . i can see elements of much better movies in iowa  spun and natural born killers . however  in addition to artiness  both those movies had good character development and coherent story lines . iowa . this movie stumbles to a preposterous end . i have to admit that it had consistency . this movie is bad from beginning to end and not particularly worse or better in any part . the actors all did what they could . roseanna arquette deserves better . she demonstrates that she is very talented  very funny  and very sexy . but why does she have to demonstrate it in this turd ball .  ,0
i made a special effort to see this movie and was totally disappointed with the outcome . on paper  the script seems hopeful  and the choice of actors leaves one with hopes  i liked pacino in scent of a woman and have seen anny duperrey and marthe keller in several french and other films of the   s    s . but i had forgotten how important a part dialogues can play in a film  and in this film they are absolute . . . . . trash  the filming locations were also attractive but the hopeless  pretentious and forced dialogues pulled the whole thing down to sub zero level . in addition to that  i am pretty allergic to the world of motor racing and find no interest in this sport . even the inelegant dialogues in  love story  were better than the ones in this film  and that  s saying something    . i was really expecting better from this film and was very disappointed to have been let down so much .  ,0
this movie sucked . it really was a waste of my life . the acting was atrocious  the plot completely implausible . long  long story short  these people get  terrorized  by this pathetic  crazed killer   but completely fail to fight back in any manner . and this is after they take a raft on a camping trip  with no gear  and show up at a campsite that is already assembled and completely stocked with food and clothes and the daughters headphones . additionally  after their boat goes missing  they panic that they  re stuck in the woods  but then the daughters boyfriend just shows up and they apparently never consider that they could just hike out of the woods like he did to get to them . like i said  this movie sucks . a complete joke . don  t let your girlfriend talk you into watching it .  ,0
as is often the case  films about self  loathing characters do not usually make for good drama .  downloading nancy  is no exception . it  s supposedly based on a true story about a woman who  s murdered at her own request by someone she meets over the internet .  br    br   the protagonist is nancy  maria bello  who is married to albert  rufus sewell  . albert is a successful software developer who has developed a golf game which his company has successfully marketed to various bars and bar  restaurants . unlike most human beings  albert has virtually no positive attributes  except for his ability to be successful in the business world  . throughout the film  albert has a grim and dour expression on his face . he has no sympathy for his wife with all her emotional problems and resorts to patronizing prostitutes . when his wife asks for sex  he punishes her by masturbating in her presence instead .  br    br   nancy is equally one  note as a character . not only has she had a loveless   year marriage but was sexually abused by her uncle when she was growing up  thankfully there are no flashbacks of that back story in the film  . her self  loathing takes the form of self  mutilation and a result  she  s forced into therapy . however  she has such contempt for her therapist that no progress can be made .  br    br   finally  nancy is so depressed that she contacts louis over the internet . he  s sort of a sadomasochistic gigolo  who has sex with women for money while inflicting massive amounts of pain to boot . it  s revealed that louis has two children but no longer sees them  the children  s mother no longer wants anything to do with him  .  br    br   nancy  s plan is to first have painful sex with louis and then have him kill her . there  s a particularly unpleasant scene where louis has sex with nancy while slashing her vaginal area with a broken piece of glass . these scenes are shown as flashbacks after louis pays a visit to albert who ties him up and strikes him with a golf club . it seems that louis has a two  fold plan in going to see albert   berate him for his treatment of nancy and   enjoy the beating he receives . it takes awhile before louis will reveal nancy  s fatefirst  he forces albert to do him the favor of taking his dog to a relative so someone will care for it in the future . nancy  s fate of course is that louis finally ended up choking her to death  but showed some hesitation first as he made it clear that he had some  feelings  for her  . we soon learn that louis is imprisoned for life for nancy  s murder .  br    br   what exactly are we to take away from a film such as downloading nancy  are we supposed to feel sorry for victims of sexual abuse and domestic violence  is that the main point of the film  is sympathy for nancy actually warranted  i don  t think so . the film  s writers create a straw man in the character of albertsomeone who is so cut off from his emotions that he is the one that is held responsible for nancy  s decline . but are people so one  dimensional in real life  i think not . they have the repulsive louis  a man who makes a living by inflicting pain  come over and berate albert for neglecting nancy . furthermore  his expressions of love towards nancy  before he kills her   is supposed to show his  sensitive side  .  br    br   in the end  it matters little whether the filmmakers have defined where their sympathies lie with the various characters in the film . they are so bent on titillating their audience with scenes of gratuitous violence  that downloading nancy becomes nothing more than an exercise in poor taste and soft pornography .  ,0
god  i was bored out of my head as i watched this pilot . i had been expecting a lot from it  as i  m a huge fan of james cameron  and not just since  titanic   i might add   and his name in the credits i thought would be a guarantee of quality  then again  he also wrote the leaden strange days . .  . but the thing failed miserably at grabbing my attention at any point of its almost two hours of duration . in all that time  it barely went beyond its two line synopsis  and i would be very hard pressed to try to figure out any kind of coherent plot out of all the mess of strands that went nowhere . on top of that  i don  t think the acrobatics outdid even those of any regular  a  team  episode . as for alba  yes  she is gorgeous  of course  but the fact that she only displays one single facial expression the entire movie  pouty and surly   makes me also get bored of her  gal wit an attitude  schtick pretty soon . you can count me out of this one  mr . cameron   ,0

i appreciate the need to hire unknowns for these kind of  horror  movies  but they should at least hire some proper actors . the sergeant especially is guilty of using his monotone to bulldozer every single line he has . but let  s face it  the lines aren  t really important . there isn  t really a recognisable plot  so most of the writing involves the words fk  st  mfr and other assorted bad language in place of proper dialogue .  br    br   the  story  as it is  is mostly made up of seemingly random gore and death  with a couple of cringe  worthy  surprises   which happen around   minutes after you see exactly what  s going to happen . not only this  but there are several glaring plot holes and continuity errors  why are they going in there  didn  t he have a weapon  wasn  t he dead    so it makes the whole film seem as if it has been cut down by the several hours it would take to fix them .  br    br   another film which simply relies on blood and gore instead of any real cinematic experience .  ,0

this film is so bad and gets worse in every imaginable fashion . its not just the poor acting and script nor is it the lame and perverse time one wastes on watching it . what really puts this film in my hall of shame is the apparent struggling that the writers and producers do with the film to try and make it funny . the actress replacing jean reno  s descendant is to old and learned her lesson in the first film so they add a new girl who is to be married . nearly all of the original extras and gags return however this time makes me want to ripe my eyes out of my sockets because it  s a waste of perfectly good film . the torture of the constant camera cuts and shots in any scene in this movie can put the viewer into violent convolutions . this second film takes the successful original and drags it out of its coffin and parades the corpse out in the public square and perversely degrades not only the original idea and its legacy but our intelligence as well . this film unlike the spruce goose could not fly for it had no plot in the principals returning for a  necklace  . no script since it was apparently written and added to daily . no attention to camera or shots in mind . poor lighting and special effects done for the sake of doing so . this film would not even pass for a student film in basic film    . how this pile got through no one can tell . it was a big loosing investment and it appears that no one had the strength to put this unnatural cruel mistake out of our miseries . this movie has one good part . . . its end  this film is my   worst film of all time  finally  howard the duck  is no longer the goose .  ,0
it  s a waist to indulge such great actors in such a weak and boring movie . besides all the unanswered questions posted in the other comments  what  s so difficult about capturing the robbers  just eliminate the bank workers  see who was at the bank  from all the cameras  footage angles  prior to the robbers entry and you have those extra  remaining robbers among the hostages . where is the suspense every body is talking about  it was so obvious the moment the hostages were asked to change into this identical uniform that they were all going to walk out the front door . . . seen it many times . at least mr . spike lee could have seasoned the movie with some good music score and artistic shooting . the movie is not worth it . pronto   ,0
no one better spoil this piece of work  awesome movie  written expertly by the likes of ira levin and depicted with the best performance of christopher reeve  s career and one of caine  s very best  this is simply excellent . i wish i could catch a staged version somewhere . . . maybe someday i will . i hope this grossly underrated  overlooked film has not become too difficult to locate because it a  must  for any hitchcockian  agatha  phile or lover of great film . one of very few movies i couldn  t instantly solve or predict and worth a second or even third viewing   deathtrap  gets a     and earns every iota of it . we need and deserve more movies like this   ,1
alexandre aja  s remake of the hills have eyes was one of the bright spots of     . not only was it a remake of a classic horror film  but it was pretty damned good too . so  nearly a year later  we are being treated to the sequel to that remake . while original scripter wes craven is back as producer and co scripted  this film just fails to rise to the level set by the original and the remake . a group of military trainees stop by in the desert to check in on some scientists and find themselves run afoul of the mutant family from the first film  at least those that remain plus some new ones  . there  s plenty of gore to be had here . what annoys me about this film is the utter lack of characterization . the viewer does not give a damn about what happens to any of these people because we haven  t gotten into them . even the mutants had some characterization last time out and this time  nothing . gore for the sake of gore is pointless . there has to be a reason for this to happen for it to be interesting . nothing that happens here is interesting . and what is it lately with rape scenes in films  here we get yet another one for no real reason . hopefully this is one set of hills that won  t be visited again .  ,0
i  ve read countless of posts about this game being so similar to max payne  when i played it the first time i thought it was a bit weird arcade  like game with a desire to rip  off the max payne style  not just bullet  time  . so when i played it for a couple of hours i realized how much fun it is  and how different from  max payne   yeah the bullet time is a bit similar but i think it fits differently to the game  style . this game is non  stop action  a mix between a shoot  em up and a fight  em up  so much fun  as a big fan of max payne i must say that the storyline of dtr is not near to the greatness of max payne  the graphics are a bit average and some of the levels look the same  but if you want a bit more of that  bullet  time  you should definitely own this game .  ,1
this movie is a ripoff of james cain  s novel  the postman always rings twice . apparently  the director and producer never bothered to pay for rights to this story   perhaps the fact that we were in the middle of fighting the italians in wwii might account for their forgetting to consider royalties  despite this  the movie isn  t really just an italian version of the hollywood movie . in some ways it  s a lot better and in other ways  it is definitely not .  br    br   the three central characters in this movie are really pretty ugly people . in fact  the male and female lovers are a bit icky  looking . the male lead is pretty ordinary except for his profuse body hair  particularly on the back and shoulders  and his lady love is  to put it frankly  unattractive . they are a very  very far cry from lana turner and john garfield in the hollywood version . and the ill  fated husband is really  really obese and loves to walk around shirtless   and his counterpart in the american film  cecil kellaway is definitely better looking  and probably better looking than the other two italian leads  actually  . and this unattractiveness is generally a reason i actually preferred the italian film   since i just could not imagine a finely coiffed  dish  like lana turner in the middle of nowhere married to kellaway   i am     sure she would have had dozens of better offers  whereas  the italian wife frankly might not have been able to do much better and this made the marriage actually believable .  br    br   part of the italian film  s believability comes from the blunt way it handles sex . the sanitized american film tries to make you believe that although turner and garfield kill kellaway  they never actually get around to sex  this is pretty silly and totally unrealistic . in addition to the casual sexuality of the film  it  s also pretty casual in showing the seamy side of life   with lots of sweaty people  a fly strip hanging over the kitchen table and everyone appeared to need a bath .  br    br   the movie is also pretty fast  paced compared to the over  long american film . and what you get due to brevity isn  t all good . the film lacks a lot of the style and polish of the american film   with grainier footage  relatively poor orchestration and sets . it sure ain  t a pretty film  but the neo  realistic  like style makes the film seem more realistic . but it cannot make up for the short  cuts in the plot . many of the plot elements in the later american version are either missing entirely or glossed over . and the ending seems a lot less interesting than the american film   and misses the entire human nature dilemma when turner and garfield turn on each other like rats  the best part of the american film  .  br    br   so which is the better film  well  a lot of this probably depends on you . as for me  the warner brothers film was simply too polished and too unrealistic  though many like this style and may dislike watching films with subtitles    but it packed a great ending . and the italian film was much  much more realistic   until the crappy ending that seemed too rushed . so neither film is exactly great  but i  d give my nod to the italian one being a bit better . it  s too bad they couldn  t have combined the best elements of both films into one exceptional film .  ,1
attention spoilers  br    br   first of all  let me say that rob roy is one of the best films of the    s . it was an amazing achievement for all those involved  especially the acting of liam neeson  jessica lange  john hurt  brian cox  and tim roth . michael canton jones painted a wonderful portrait of the honor and dishonor that men can represent in themselves . but alas . . .  br    br   it constantly  and unfairly gets compared to  braveheart  . these are two entirely different films  probably only similar in the fact that they are both about scots in historical scotland . yet  this comparison frequently bothers me because it seems to be almost assumed that  braveheart  is a better film than  rob roy  . i like  braveheart  a lot  but the idea of comparing it to  rob roy  is a little insulting to me . to put quite simply  i love  braveheart   but it is a pale shadow to how much i love  rob roy  . here are my particular reasons . . .  br    br     rob roy  is about real people .  br    br   let  s face it  the william wallace in  braveheart  is not a real person . he  s a legend  a martyr  a larger than life figurehead . because of this depiction  he is also a perfect person  never doing wrong  and basically showing his scot countrymen to the promised land . when he finally does fail  it is not to his fault . like jesus  he is betrayed by the very people he trusted most . he even goes through the worst kind of torture because he wants freedom so much .  br    br   the depiction of wallace is very well done and effective . but it really doesn  t inspire or intrigue me . i find human ambiguity far more facinating than human perfection . that is why  the last temptation of christ  is a better film than  king of kings   and that is also one of the reasons why i think  rob roy  is better than  braveheart  . rob roy may be heroic and brave  but he is far from perfect . he makes several mistakes that affected the lives of many of his loved ones . now sure  not bearing false claim against the duke of argyll was an act of nobility and courage  but it was also an act of egoism and self centeredness . let us not forget that the kinfolk that he had claimed to protect were driven homeless by the end of the film because of this act . but rob did the best he could  and that was all you could ask of him .  br    br   rob  s wife mary  is also a normal  ambigious person . let us start though  with how she looks in this film . sure  she  s beautiful  but she doesn  t wear makeup and she basically allows her natural beauty to show . compare this with the two loves  or one  depending on your point of view  of william wallace in  braveheart  . now these two ladies are hot  but hardly indicitive of how women looked at the time  especially the lay persons  . maybe not a fair comparison  but just another example of how rob roy  s attempts for accuracy are far more effective .  br    br   throughout  rob roy   mary has to live with her vicious rape by the dastardly carrion  cunningham . she feels compelled to tell rob of her struggle  but doesn  t because she knows that rob must seek revenge for her rape . such revenge would surely mean the death of rob  and mary is not prepared for such a sacrifice .  br    br   the villains in  rob roy  are equally as compelling . although the enemies in  braveheart  are well written  they are hardly original . robert the bruce  a man both brave and cowardly  is plagued by moral decisions that are all to familar in the fictional realm . should he take his claim as the king of scotland  or should he betray wallace in order to ensure the safety of his family name  bruce is the most ambigious character in  braveheart   but from brutus in  julius ceasar  to fredo in  the godfather part ii   these types of characters are hardly original . longshanks  although a compelling villain in his own right  is very one dimensional . he is the epidemy of evil  and his tyrant ways stand in direct contrast to wallace  s heroism .  br    br    rob roy  has three villains that are wonderful in their chicanery . first of all  let  s start with marquis of montrose . he is a man who is so obsessed with his self image  that he  s willing to let an innocent man suffer because of it .  see to it that i am not mocked  are his favorite words to his  factor  . he is a man obsessed with power  upset that a man of great noble bearing as the duke of argyll can be considered of greater providency then him . he is shamefully self obsessed and insecure . he is an evil aristocrat  but in ways that make him unique .  br    br   cunningham and callarn are the conspirators in  rob roy   and are also roy  s direct assailants . callarn is so cunning in his cowardace that he is almost comical . he will do anything to maintain the good will of the marquis  which includes backstabbing and trickery . cunningham is a compelling character in that he seems to have been raised to do whatever he can to obtain status and the affection of the marquis . he needs a father  little does he know that the marquis is his real father . therefore  when the opportunity to obtain wealth comes from callarn  he grabs it without even questioning it . he is very much like the evil of modern man  so self centered and vain that he cares not about the consequences of his actions on others .  br    br   many have criticized tim roth  s performance in this film as overacting . hogwash i say . it is clear that cunningham is not simply evil but also psychopath throughout the film . in a world where a man and his stepson can go around shooting random people for amusement  is cunningham too much of an unbelievable character  we live in a society where people seem to have decreased the value of human life .  rob roy  simply teaches us that only the circumstances of this decreased value has changed . it is a problem throughout human history that the vanity of the human heart will not allow for the capacity for compassion . rob roy and mary give us hope that goodness will prevail  but snakes will always exist in our world .  br    br   another character that i find fascinating is the duke of argyll . he is a true nobleman  and his values of honesty and courtesy are in direct contrast to the marquis . he appreciates the bravery of rob roy and mary  and has a direct vexation for the marquis and his factor . he gives the world hope for the people of power . hopefully  people like the marquis are an exception and not the rule .  br    br    the final duel in  rob roy  is more exciting then   of the battle scenes in  braveheart  .  br    br   one thing i get tired of is people telling me that  braveheart  is a better film because of the battle scenes . first of all  battle scenes are hardly original . from  spartacus  to  gladiator   hollywood has had a long tradition of historical european battle scenes .  braveheart  has some of the best battle scenes ever put on film  but they suffer from one important problem . these battle scenes have no context except for the fight for freedom .  br    br   now  don  t get me wrong  duels are hardly original either . in fact  there are probably   times as many films with duels as there are with battle scenes . but the context of the duel between cunningham and rob roy is a beauty to behold . it is one of the greatest scenes in film history . let me explain why . . .  br    br   first of all  the fighting style and the bearing of the two characters in this duel describe the characters perfectly . cunningham is effette and dangerous  rob roy is strong and courageous . cunningham uses a fencing sword while rob uses a broadsword . cunningham fights with quick tricky movements  while roy  s fighting style is more obvious .  br    br   the whole film  from the deliberately slow first half to the exciting second half  is leading up to this moment . it is powerful stuff  and it is clear that rob must exterminate this menacing evil that has plagued his whole world . when rob finally gets the upper hand  literally and figuratively   it is one of the greatest moments in film history . rob wins because he has more to live for  and his honor is more powerful than   cunningham  s . the use of music is absolutely chilling in this scene . good prevailing against a real evil is more powerful to me than seeing a dude get disemboweled just so he can yell  freedom   . but hey  maybe that  s just me .  br    br     rob roy  is more realistic than  braveheart   br    br   i don  t know that people in the aristocracy or scotsmen talked like the people in  rob roy   but i do feel that it clearly an attempt to capture their speech patterns . i feel that many people are bored by  rob roy  simply because they can  t understand what the characters are saying . if this is the case  then read some shakesphere  or put on the close  captioning .  rob roy  is actually one of the greatest written films of the    s . many of the dialogue in this film is clever  but maybe you have to watch the film a couple of times to understand it .  br    br   by contrast  the dialogue in  braveheart  is hardly very interesting . of course  what do you expect when the main character is a scotsman played by an australian  this is a legend  and there was clearly not an attempt to capture the speech of the times . this film takes place several centuries before  rob roy   and yet they talk like the people today . thus the reason that many people like it better . audiences today have become increasingly lazy  and they don  t want to take the time or patience to understand things that are complex . therefore  as with many epic films  they expect to see the villians speak a recognizable english accent while the heroes speak in a vernacular not too far away from our american language . sure  it is clear that the wallace is scotish  but other than sounding like scotty from star trek and a couple of  aye  s for acknowledgement  the scots in this film fit into the hollywood tradition of how we believe scots should sound .  br    br   so  do these descriptions prove that  rob roy  is a better film than  braveheart   hardly . but if it proves one thing  it shows that it is hardly common knowledge that  braveheart  is a better film than  rob roy  . to put simply   rob roy  is a film that has themes that are very apropos in today  s world .  braveheart  is a film about a legend that is inspiring but hardly realistic . you can make a decision on what you think is better . . .  br    br   grade  a score    ,1
this movie was so badly written  directed and acted that it beggars belief . it should be remade with a better script  director and casting service . the worst problem is the acting . you have jennifer beals on the one hand who is polished  professional and totally believable  and on the other hand  ri  chard  who is woefully miscast and just jarring in this particular piece . peter gallagher and jenny levine are just awful as the slave owning  and keeping  couple  although both normally do fine work . the actors  and director  should not have attempted to do accents at all   they are inconsistent and unbelievable . much better to have concentrated on doing a good job in actual english . the casting is ludicrous . why have children of an  african  merchant  thus less socially desirable to the gens de couleur society  been cast with very pale skinned actors  while the supposedly socially desirable marcel  has pronounced african features  including an obviously dyed blond  fro   it  s as if the casting directors cannot be bothered to read the script they are casting and to chose appropriate actors from a large pool of extremely talented and physically diverse actors of color . it  s just so weird  this could be a great movie and should be re  made  but with people who respect the material and can choose appropriate and skilled actors . there are plenty of good actors out there  and it would be fun to see how jennifer beals  daniel sunjata and gloria reuben would do with an appropriate cast  good script and decent direction .  ,0
i know it  s crude  and i know that it isn  t at all pc  but it  s so funny . if you can put it into perspective that it  s from the early    s and it carries all the stereotypes of the time   and the movie still makes you almost pass out with laughter   than it is truly a good comedy . going with the tradition of what comedies have been for thousands of years  the subject matter of this film is exagerated . if you can suspend your political correctness for an hour and a half  just to have an all  out laugh  than please watch this .  br    br   p . s . would someone please put this out on dvd  it  s so hard to find on vhs anymore .  ,1
the writers probably had no experience in the army  and probably never glanced at a history book  but i still give this cheaply produced war film some credit for taking a long  needed look at the role of black soldiers in the second world war .  br    br   the action is confused and unbelievable   any episode of combat  has better production values  but the cast is interesting . seeing new york giant rosie greer was worth the buck i paid for this . the art direction is fifth rate   the men wear korean war uniforms  and it was pretty lousy weather by the time the u . s . army reached germany in      not sunny as they show here  and i don  t think the terrain resembled northern california . the script never does make clear why the black support troops are used as combat soldiers . there is a nice touch that shows some of the men carrying springfield rifles instead of m   s  which second rate troops probably would have been issued with .  br    br   this basic story idea  racist southern officer commanding black troops  should have been expanded into a big budget production back then  and its not too late to try it now . you have to take this for what it is  and i admire the creators of this film for making the effort .  br    br   i remember seeing this a while ago and thinking it was set in italy  which would have made more sense because there were black combat troops operating there in     .  ,0
where do i begin  i wanted to enjoy this movie  and i did . still  i wanted to be able to enjoy it for being another zombie film that was worth my loot  and it wasnt . this was a different kind of enjoyment . this was unhealthy  a perverse glee that i partook in watching one of the most ridiculous films id seen yet . and i dont much care for whatever fulci  s excuses were  there was no excuse for this film going how it went . this was a bad film all the way around  yet i still cant give it below a  out of ten  which is what i gave it  because well . . . at least i was able to laugh at this misfit of a movie .  br    br   i had to imagine these zombies  that were all over the ceilings of these buildings everywhere . . . had to imagine that they were either bored as hell so they crawled up on the beems  and perched themselves high on stone erections  or they saw the fleshy living motley band of jerk  offs coming around  so they took it upon themselves to stage numerous aerial ambushes . hell  what else is there to do when youre dead   br    br   i had to laugh at some zombies performing what looked to be martial arts swings  kicks  and jumps  and some shambling about like traditional meatlovers . i feasted my eyes on a floating head that was never explained . i watched in pure horrific delight as the land they were in  the phillipenes  was absolutely engulfed in fog  heavy doses of fog  and that the ponds were as they were boiling castle moats . i had to even cringe when i saw that the design for a cure for this plague was sketched on a chalkboard as an octagon with lines stretching from each angle  with  dead one  written in the middle . i had to ask myself . . . if the science of curing zombies is that easy  then i wonder if i could come up with a little something to start a zombie outbreak here   br    br   all in all the effects were overboard  the dubbing horrid  im sure the original acting as poor  the story absurd  the zombies inconsistent  even in a bad way they couldve all been similar  and the women ugly  but i found myself enjoying this thing . it was a fun watch . it turned out to be a very very bad film  and i would not recommend this thing unless one is into bad directorial exploitation films  but still  again i say . . . it was worth a good laugh . i crave zombie films no matter what  but when this had fulci  s name attached to it  it shouldve been much better . let me dare say  zombie holocaust was better .  ,0
this movie is a journey through the mind of a screenwriter caught in his own paradoxical philosophy . he examines the ever illusive question of  who am i  and  what is i   it  s a courageous and thought provoking enterprise . there is a shipload of beautiful images  dream  inspired  escher  like paradoxes reminiscent of the hand drawing itself  or rather  erasing itself . more and more we follow the writer in his agony over what to say and what to film  we see him phoning with his wife who left for peru  leaving him to take care of their baby  a task he performs with less and less attention until he  s so absorbed in his dilemma  s that he hardly looks at the child anymore . his wife comes back and makes a scene  destroys his notes and helping him go over the last treshold until he erases him  self . interspersed with eye  pleasing and i  destructing images  the story is mainly philosophical . it  s about the veils of maya  the world of illusion . the paradox of the movie however  is that it needs a lot of talking and thinking to prove that thinking should stop . during the more than two hours of provocative beauty and rapid philosophising the movie made me long for silence or a shorter movie . if that was the purpose of the maker  he succeeded quite well .  ,1
interesting  fast  paced and amusing .  br    br   i  m not one of those people who watches loads and loads of television . i stumbled across this show while home sick with a bad case of the flu one day  and was immediately hooked . i developed quite a crush on john burke . both he and claire did an amazing job of hosting the show together . you could really tell that they both loved their jobs .  br    br   the super  collector segments were excellent . i found myself interested in things i had never previously given a single thought to .  br    br   what i would really like to know is whatever happened to jack the dog  did one of the hosts adopt him   ,1
the first two sequences of this movie set up the two conflicts the  thematic  conflict between the soldier todd and his suppressed humanity  and the  physical  conflict between todd and his bio  engineered replacement . both sequences are quite gripping in different ways .  br    br   peoples  screenplay falters somewhat by resolving the first of these arcs half  way through the movie  which means the second half is little more than a straightforward action romp .  br    br   nonetheless  kudos to the makers for creating an genre action piece with heart and even a bit of soul and especially to kurt russell who conveys much with very little .  br    br   not a great film  but one worth seeing .  ,1
this was the worst film i have seen for a long time .  br    br   not only that it has nearly nothing to do with the other american pie movies  the story is obvious  flat and absolutely not funny .  br    br   the girls are nice though  but spending your time watching a cheap soft porno would possibly be greater than watching this film .  br    br   this film seems to be a very bad made sex ad  made for an audience that is not older than   .  br    br   i never visited an american college  but i would seriously doubt that anyone who did could really laugh about any of the scenes .  br    br   save your time  do something else .  ,0
gung ho tries to express many ideas and entertain us with a wiseguy comedy at the same time . the result is uneven  but generally entertaining . keaton balances all three aspects of his lead character quite well . wantabedde is even better . one warning george wendt is very poor in his supporting role . otherwise  this is quite enjoyable time capsule .  ,1
i  ve recently went back and watched this movie again from not seeing it in years . when i first seen the movie i was too young to understand what the movie was about . now that i  ve seen it again i couldn  t believe what i  ve missed all these years . for me being able to see movies for what they are  i think that this movie was great . most people feel as though the music are the best part  but i don  t think that  s true . most people don  t realize how good the story is because it  s judge by the acting . the truth of the matter is that no one in the movie were really trying to act rather they were just being themselves . the entire main cast were just playing themselves . they weren  t trying to be anyone else  but themselves .  br    br   i  ve actually watched and analyzed the work and effort put into the movie . now from my perspective  the situations shown in the movie are pretty much based on what actually went on musically in minneapolis at the time and it  s most of the things that happen are actually true events that happened in prince  s career and who can tell it better than him  the music that was coming from the city at the time was starting to be recognized and be revolutionary . it was interesting to see how the music was very influential mainly at the club  first avenue   th st entry  where in fact prince  among other musicians  got their career started . it  s also a known fact that prince and morris day always had a competition with each other in real life  but it was a friendly competition . they were always friends . so the story basically plays off of that competition aspect of their rivalry rather than their friendship which shows the true competitive side of what occurred at club  first avenue  for it  s time .  br    br   another reason why this movie is good is due to the fact that some of the situations that occur in the movie are actually based on events that prince has gone through in his life with the music aspect and the personal . to me  this made the movie more realistic as far as the emotion because he  s telling his trials and tribulations pre  superstardom . plus  his dedication he puts into his performances is phenomenal . prince made sure that every moment in the movie was done perfectly . anytime you hear a song play in the movie it  s in perfect sync with the situation at hand .  br    br   prince is in all a musical genius and he has proved it on many occasions . this movie is what really put prince on the map officially and he hasn  t slowed down since . anyone who has watched this movie or still  unbelieveably  hasn  t watched it yet  when you sit down and view this film you have have to watch it with intellect or you will miss the whole aspect of the movie . if you really love music this is definitely the movie to watch . above what anyone else says i think it  s a great movie to watch and own .  ,1
i attempted watching this movie twice and even then fast forwarding the irritating parts but still could not make it to the end .  br    br   i don  t understand how this movie genuinely got any good reviews . i think these people giving such good reviews are just trying to hype the movie for marketing purposes . their reviews seem very unrealistic and it looks like an inside job  which makes things more pitiful . movies should get true positive comments on their own steam and not contrived ones    br    br   the acting was reminiscent of a cheesy porno movie  and not in a funny way . i don  t mind low budget movies with bad acting if they know how to work with it .  br    br   i found the lead character to be irritating . his facial expressions and humor was unbearably childish . i thought this was intentional to make the womens conspiracy seem more enjoyable and founded  but they were even worse .  br    br   the script was also very awkward  his bosses overdone business speech  and the unfunny sarcastic remarks .  br    br   i did not find anything redeeming about this movie other than some of the attractive women .  br    br   never have i felt that a rating was this misleading . i was interested by its premise but scared off by everything else . of course see it if you want  but i just didn  t want anyone else to get their hopes up  waste their time .  br    br   maybe it is just me . . . probably not .  ,0
really started the   s trend of disgusting violence masquerading as a  horror film  . i was the target audience for this repellent piece of trash and i was disgusted then as now .  br    br   oh  where do we start . let  s see  the setup you can bring people back to live if they died a violent death . so that laughably weak premise is the excuse to butcher people in horrible ways  because  well  that  s needed to bring them back to life  this might have worked if played over the top for black laughs a la re  animator or something . but no  it  s played straight . there is a whole terrified family in a wagon that gets hunted down  one of the few scenes at least where their demise is off screen . however  just about everything else is on screen . there is actually a scene where a young girl walking along is beaten and killed by zombie townspeople  who are all filming it and grinning with several cameras . then  there is a closeup of her face as the filmmakers lovingly   and time consumingly   reveal in time  lapse photography her beaten face being carved down to a skull and rebuilt to look  normal  again . this done  of course  by a slumming jack albertson as the mortician behind it all . he likes to drive around in a ambulance  hearse playing old tommy dorcey tunes  i guess that is supposed to be cute .  br    br   in the end  of course  even the sheriff is undead and the doctor offers kindly to fix his rotting hands . not clear why the sheriff is not out with the other townspeople killing children with glee and slicing their faces off  sticking needles in burn  victims eyes  etc .  br    br   i wonder  really wonder  what people see in a geek show like this to give it any kind of rating at all . it  s not scary  the twists are laughable  and overall it  s kind of sick . it  s not even well enough done to  see it on a dare  or enjoy on a level you might watch a bad hg lewis film . it  s just god  awful trash  made for people who get off on this type of pointless gore  and made by people slumming for a paycheck .  br    br   sad that albertson was even involved .  ,0
this movie starred a totally forgotten star from the     s  jack pearl  radio  s  baron munchausen   as well as jimmy durante . however       decades later  it  s being billed as a three stooges film because they are the only ones in the film who the average person would recognize today . film fanatics will also recognize the wonderful edna may oliver as well as zazu pitts .  br    br   as for the stooges  this is a film from there very early days   before mgm had any idea what to do with the team . at this point  they were known as  ted healy and his stooges  as healy was the front man . fortunately for the stooges  they soon left this nasty and rather untalented man  read up on him   you  ll see what i mean  and the rest is history . within a year  they were making very successful shorts for columbia and executives at mgm were soon kicking themselves for losing the team . this sort of thing was a common occurrence at mgm  a great studio which had no idea what to do with comedy  such as the films of buster keaton  laurel and hardy  abbott and costello and others  . in fact  up until they left for columbia  mgm put them in a wide variety of odd film roles   including acting with clark gable and joan crawford in dancing lady . and  oddly  in this film they didn  t act as a team   they just did various supporting roles  such as larry playing the piano   br    br   this particular film begins with pearl and durante lost in the african jungle . when they are rescued and brought home  all sense of structure to the film falls apart and the film becomes almost like a variety show   punctuated by scenes with the leads here and there . as for pearl  i could really see why he never made a successful transition to films  as he has the personality of a slug  but slightly less welcome  . as for durante  i never knew what the public saw in him   as least as far as his films are concerned   he was loud and . . . loud  he apparently took time off from helping mgm to ruin buster keaton  s career to make this film . together  pearl and durante rely on lots of verbal humor    and vaudeville  style routines that tend to fall rather flat .  br    br   in this film  the stooges they didn  t yet have the right chemistry . seeing healy doing the job that moe did in their later films is odd . what they did in the film was pretty good  but because all the segments were short  they came on and off camera too quickly to allow them to really get into their routines . stooges fans might be very frustrated at this  though die  hard fans may want to see this so that they can complete their life  long goal of seeing everything stooge   even the rotten joe derita and joe besser films  oh  and did they got bad after the deaths of shemp and curly  .  br    br   overall  the film is rather dull and disappointing . however  there are a couple interesting things to look for in the mess . at about the   minute mark  you will see a brief scene where a tour guide on a bus is singing . look carefully  as this is walter brennan in a role you  d certainly never expect  another unusual thing to look for in the film is the  clean as a whistle  song starting at about   minutes into the film . this song and dance number is clearly an example of a so  called  pre  code  scene that never would have been allowed in films after      when the production code was strengthened  . despite the word  clean  in the title  it  s a very titillating number with naked women showing lots of flesh   enough to stimulate but not enough to really show anything  it  s quite shocking when seen today  though such excesses were pretty common in the early     s . finally  at the   minute mark  see jimmy durante set race relations back a few decades . see the film  you  ll see that i mean   ,0
  moonstruck  is a love story . there is not one romance  there are at least three  but they all have to do with the same family . loretta  s family . loretta  cher  is about to marry johnny cammareri  danny aiello  . she doesn  t love him  but he is sweet and good man . when he leaves to visit his dying mother in italy loretta meets johnny  s brother ronny  nicolas cage  . he and johnny haven  t spoken each other in five years and loretta wants to invite him to the wedding . of course they fall instantly for each other .  br    br   how this story and love stories of loretta  s parents and uncle and aunt develop is something you simply have to see for yourself . every seen is a delight to watch  with cher as the bright star in the middle of everything . she won and really deserved the oscar that year . cage is pretty good  and goofy as well  and olympia dukakis as loretta  s mother and vincent gardenia as her father are terrific . this movie is funny  charming and therefore highly enjoyable .  ,1

a small funny film . it is totally incredible  unbelievable  impossible . but it is funny how an introverted masochist can become totally dependent and mesmerized  even hypnotized by a girl he hardly knows but who was able to get down into his phantasms . of course it is a denunciation of the foolish deals you can get to on the internet . you must not believe ten percent of what you  re told there and never  ever  ever accept to tie up your hands in a way or another to someone or something or some organization you do not know personally . most of their  businesses  there are in a way or another going to fool you and raid you . but here the chap deserves being the victim of such gangsters because he is not only naive  he is absurdly silly . but then the film becomes funny because it ends up with the victim of the crooked business having the upper hand and ending up playing the same game with his victimizer and winning . one think is sure too . security in english airports is not exactly what it should be  but i guess it  s not better anywhere else in the world and even now they have tightened up all rules and regulations it is just fun to go through their procedures and foil them systematically . then they have their vengeance by losing your luggage  a real plague on modern airports  and don  t expect to get fair compensation . or even confiscating a bottle opener or a can opener because it may be dangerous . i can see myself cutting my way through the side of the plane with a can opener . funny  isn  t it  dr jacques coulardeau  university paris dauphine  university paris  pantheon sorbonne  university versailles saint quentin en yvelines  ,1
this is peter falk  s film . period .  br    br   i was   years old when this film came out i was already a film maven at the time . of course neither my parents nor i saw this film when it came out  but i was in love with the typeface of its ads  the aura that this was an important film . okay    years later i  ve finally seen the film   having never seen any cassavetes  directed film previously . he  s a hack  overall . zero sense of timing  editing . gena  s performance reminds me too much of dustin hoffman  s stint in  rain man   technically on par but entirely one  note . as tom cruise stole  rain man   falk takes the cake for this film .  br    br   i was annoyed with gena  s performance  really throughout   it seemed better suited for  awakenings   blecch   . it  s not all her fault she  s a basket case from first scene to last . we never find out why   but falk  s character seems real  is performed wonderfully by falk as a seriously flawed man .  br    br   shave off at least an hour  an editor needed    and this would have been an arresting portrait not of a woman under the influence but of a simple  cro  magnon  man coming to grips with a wife who doesn  t work  yet cannot deal with her three kids  her husband  s long hours of work .  br    br   i  d rather remember cassavetes for  the dirty dozen  or  rosemary  s baby .  he would have been a better director had he snipped his own tendency for excess   as he amply demonstrates with this film .  br    br   bob  ,0

sondra locke stinks in this film  but then she was an awful  actress  anyway . unfortunately  she drags everyone else  including then real life boyfriend clint eastwood down the drain with her . but what was clint eastwood thinking when he agreed to star in this one  one read of the script should have told him that this one was going to be a real snorer . it  s an exceptionally weak story  basically no story or plot at all . add in bored  poor acting  even from the normally good eastwood . there  s absolutely no action except a couple arguments and as far as i was concerned  this film ranks up at the top of the heap of natural sleep enhancers . wow  could a film be any more boring  i think watching paint dry or the grass grow might be more fun . a real stinker . don  t bother with this one .  ,0
there  s nothing worse than renting an asian movie and getting an american movie experience instead .  br    br   it  s only my opinion  but a good thriller is dependent upon the establishment of likable  intelligent characters . as far as likability is concerned  the protagonists in say yes are a quaint married couple . nicely done . unfortunately  they are stupid beyond belief . let us count the ways they mishandle being terrorized by a stalker .  br    br    . after a hitchhiker threatens to kill you  be sure to tell him what hotel you  re staying at when you drop him off .  br    br    . beat the hell out of the stalker in broad daylight and in front of dozens of witnesses  thereby allowing him to press charges of assault .  br    br    . don  t bother telling the police about the stalker and simply assume  for no apparently good reason  that the cops were bribed by him .  br    br    . while trying to escape  let your lady out of your sight as much as possible to ensure that the stalker kidnaps her .  br    br    . after getting help from someone to find the stalker after kidnapping your wife  be sure to send them away as soon as possible so you can face him one  on  one . no point in being unfair  right   br    br   now  i  d never expect that any person would be immune to making a few mistakes under these stressful conditions  but the characters in say yes are so dense and make so many unbelievable mistakes that it  s effectively impossible for the viewer to care about their safety  since they are victims of their own doing . this kills the enjoyability of the entire film .  br    br   in case you were wondering  the scriptwriters didn  t stop with dim  witted characters . since they themselves are surely dim  witted for writing this crapfest  they decided to make situations so absurdly unrealistic that all sense of reality goes out the window .  br    br    . the stalker kills a cop inside a police station  while the protagonist is asleep no more than ten feet away .  br    br    . the stalker engages in all sorts of dubious activities in broad daylight and around tons of people  yet no one other than the married couple seems to notice his odd behavior .  br    br    . the stalker survives an absurd amount of violence that would have killed any human being .  br    br    . the  suspense  scenes had no imagination whatsoever . in fact  some scenes were direct rip  offs from american movies .  br    br   the only positive is the decapitation near the end  which was a pretty brutal scene since it was inflicted upon the wife . it  s too bad the filmmakers followed it up with an outrageously stupid ending that comes out of left field .  br    br   truly  the koreans behind the making of say yes should be ashamed of themselves . better yet  they should just move to california and take employment with people who make movies with a similar disregard for quality and intelligence .  ,0
unfortunately i have to agree with the critic written by halopes .  br    br   for a short film the cinematography  costumes  sets  sound  editing and everything else is very  very good . this might seem surprising at first but i was told that the technical crew working on this consisted of professionals  so the quality is to be expected . the problem  as usual  resides in the story itself .  br    br   thing is  it  s not really a story . to tell a story  or in cinema  s case  show a story  you need plot and conflict . you need things that happen to the protagonist events . these events happen because the protagonist wants something and  for some reason  he can  t get it . tim watcher has no problems or goals . he  s a kind of supernatural entity who observes mankind . that  s it . so what we have here is pure exposition . instead of being shown a story  we  re simply learning things about this tim watcher individual . of course  considering the peculiar nature of tim watcher and the film  s short duration  it  s hard to give enough background about him so the movie resorts to voice  over narration . in this case it  s used in the worst possible sense which is to give information that otherwise we  d never glean . in fact  if it wasn  t for the vo we  d think the character was just a kooky old man going around looking at things . to make it worse the vo also explains what  s happening on the screen  the images we  re shown are just decoration for the text we  re listening to .  br    br   i could say that this short film would make a good video for a band or something  but because the images don  t stand on their own it  s impossible to say that . what  s left obviously has value as a measure of the crew  s technical capabilities  not incredible  but good  but fails to entertain  amuse  thrill or  at the very least  show a story .  ,0
carlo verdone once managed to combine superb comedy with smart and subtle social analysis and criticism .  br    br   then something happened  and he turned into just another dull  holier  than  thou  director .  br    br   il mio miglior nemico can more or less be summarized in one line  working class  kind and warm  while upper  class  snob and devious . but love wins in the end  .  br    br   such a trite clich for such a smart director .  br    br   there isn  t really too much to talk about in the movie . every character is a walking stereotype the self  made  man who forgets his roots but who  ll become  good  again  the scorned wife  the rebellious rich girl who falls for the honest  but  poor guy . . . acting is barely average .  br    br   severely disappointing under every aspect .  ,0
whoever said that horror wasn  t an educational film genre  huh  thanks to this marvelous hammer short movie  i now at least know never to offer a strange visitor any wine and a slice of bread with salt in my own house  because he might just be hypnotist and this combination will give him the power to control my thoughts  mind forever  thank you hammer  the tenth episode in the house of horror series is another one i  ve been looking forward to seeing  mainly because the guy in the director  s chair was don sharp one of britain  s finest filmmakers but still sadly underrated . sharp was responsible for some very cool hammer films  like  kiss of the vampire  and  rasputin the mad monk   as well as some overlooked independent productions like  dark places  and  psychomania  . his contribution to house of horror is easily one of the best in the series  with a complex yet fascinating plot outline and revolving on delightful occult themes . the plot centers on two antique dealers that stumble upon a strange object resembling a mirror  but it  s actually an ancient scrying device that can be used to summon choronzhon the demonic guardian of the abyss . the mirror is heavily desired by a satanic cult since they need it for their ceremonies  but michael is reluctant to sell it before knowing the real value of the device . when he picks up a clearly petrified girl who  s running from the cult to avoid being sacrificed  michael is drawn even deeper into an occult conspiracy . satanic cults and the carnal sacrifice of young women are typical british horror topics  but david fischer  s screenplay is never dull and offers plenty of neat plot twits  among which a highly inventive climax . there  s also plenty of tension to admire  the dialogs are wit and the acting performances are splendid  especially john carson as the leader of the cult is genuinely eerie  . recommended   ,1
now days  most people don  t watch classic movies  such as this . most of friends only watch movies from the    s to present . thats kinda stingy .  br    br   most old movies like this are masterpieces  unique in their own way . only because  back when these movies were being thought of and made  thats when ideas were fresh . now people strain just to think of new ideas .  br    br   anyway  to the movie . for true fans of classic horror . this is for you . the movie is based with a investigator from scotland yard investigating the disappearance of an movie actor  and stumbles on to three other strange occurrences with past residents of the same house .  br    br   i won  t say anymore  for i will ruin the movie more than i already have . but it is a terrific movie for as old as it is . and would never mind watching it again   ,1
i actually have a fondness for christopher lee  but this just wasn  t up to his other performances . . . and he was one of the better actors .  br    br   the film does not live up to its premise . it  s not that scary  it  s overly melodramatic  and it draaaaaags . every time i thought   oh  here comes the good part  the good part never quite arrived .  br    br   the evil ones aren  t at all convincing . most of the other characters were also lacking in depth .  br    br   perhaps if i  d been in the proper frame of mind  i might have enjoyed some mstie  fication at this film  s expense  but . . . . naaahhh . . . didn  t really seem to be worth the effort . it wasn  t really very good  it wasn  t really very bad  it was just mediocre .  ,0
a christmas together actually came before my time  but i  ve been raised on john denver and the songs from this special were always my family  s christmas music . for years we had a crackling cassette made from a record that meant it was christmas . a few years ago  i was finally able to track down a video of it on ebay  so after listening to all the music for some   years  i got to see john and the muppets in action for myself . if you ever get the chance  it  s a lot of fun   great music  heart  warming and cheesy . it  s also interesting to see the    s versions of the muppets and compare them to their newer versions today . i believe denver actually took some heat for doing a show like this   i guess normally performers don  t compromise their images by doing sing  a  longs with the muppets  but i  m glad he did . even if you can  t track down the video  the soundtrack is worth it too . it has some muppified traditional favorites  but also some original denver tunes as well .  ,1
this movie is a perfect example of an excellent book getting ruined by a movie . jacob have i loved is quite possibly the worst film that i have ever seen . there is no storyline  plots disappear  and the editing is awful . to top it all off  the music is straight from a synthesizer and sounds unbelievably terrible . bridget fonda  s acting is decent  but everyone else  s acting is totally amateur . i would suggest this movie to someone who is studying to be a producer as a study on how not to produce a movie as it is chock full of bad cut  scenes  bad transitions and acting that should have been re  shot  read the book and don  t waste your time with this film .  ,0
why didn  t the producers give that show a chance of all the junk on tv  why didn  t the producers give six degrees a chance  will the series go on video  i would love to see how it ends . put season one on video and sell it . i was a loyal fan of six degrees and waited for it  s return . i set my recorder to tape all of the shows . thank god for that . i just found out that the show was canceled and i  m heart broken . i wish i knew it was going to be canceled  why didn  t they tell us  i thought the show was just developing some depth in the characters . the writing was pretty good also . steven  campbell scott  is my all time favorite . i am so sorry to see it go   ,1
there are pretty landscape shots . writers putting trite mouthings into actors mouths . with lesser actors this show would be silly .  art must uplift humanity or it  s bs .  not so because art of all those mentioned is also to stir humanity and express the dark side . the lead character even says those who don  t drink hide the shadow side . wrong  he lived in darkness and repressed his dark side by drinking and being one dimensional not expanding his horizons with something other than landscapes . there wasn  t a breathing organism in his work nor expression of his pain . all the artist did was limit himself to dime a dozen landscapes . the discussions between the characters was grade school  trite stuff always giving the one character the upper hand the writer wanted . i tried to like it after reading all the first wow comments on here . i had to dig deep to see those i agreed with . i figure the great comments were from those connected to the movie . i was moved only once towards the end . the kid was way too passive . the scenery was nice and the music ridiculous . just my opinion but nowhere show for me .  ,0
this film is about british prisoners of war from the world war ii escaping from a camp in germany .  br    br   i find  the wooden horse  disappointingly boring . the subject could have been thrilling  suspenseful and adrenaline fuelled  but  the wooden horse  is told in a very plain way . it  s a collection of plain and poorly told events  with no suspension and thrill . the first half plainly tells how the prisoners of war dug a tunnel  but the events are so plain  with not enough blunders and close shaves to make me on edge . the latter half of the film is even worse  they are just moving from one place to another without any cat and mouse chase . and could the characters talk a bit less and have more action in an action film  i am disappointed by  the wooden horse   it wasted the potential to be a great film .  ,0
i found this movie to be charming . i thought the characters were developed since as i watched  i found myself caring about these people . this is a period piece that i believe took place during the depression . a single mother  who is known as the town recluse  she has reason to be   puts an ad in the paper for  a husband  . christopher reeve plays a ex  con who happens into town looking for work . he sees the ad and he goes out to see her . she hires him . i really had some chuckles as their relationship progresses because i found it easy to put myself in their shoes . everything went on so matter of fact . he needs the work so he doesn  t want to upset her . and she needing his help  but doesn  t want him to get the upper hand . they dance around the fact that they begin to really need each other . things start warming up until . . . . . . the big blowup . i won  t spoil it by telling you what happens . but the point of resolution is perfectly wonderful . i found the story to be very believable for the time it  s taking place . i think this is one of the better  relationship  stories out there . maybe the younger generation won  t  get it  but if you are over   i think you  ll like it . and if you liked christopher reeve in  somewhere in time  you  ll like him in this one also .  ,1
i won  t argue with anyone who pronounces this film execrable  as is january jones  s performance  but please check her out  if you haven  t already  in the amc tv series  mad men   starting later this month . she  s excellent  as is the entire cast . i  ll charitably assume she took on the  taboo  role strictly for the money  and  realizing what a putrid mess it was going to be  turned in a minimal acting job to avoid starvation . don  t know if that  s the case  but i  now  know for sure that she can act .  br    br   at first  watching  taboo   i was convinced her flat delivery was a shrewd choice that would later give rise to some significant revelation about her character or the plot . no such luck . hard to believe the director didn  t suggest to her at least once that not changing expression for   successive scenes could cause lockjaw .  br    br   ironically  her winning performance in  mad men  comes as a character who  at least in her early appearances  is very repressed  reserved  unsure of herself  and rather colorless  not unlike her  taboo  role . but as the tv series progressed  she began to blossom into someone who questions her traditional early     s whitebread mom role . can  t wait to see where they take her character in the  nd season .  br    br   to sum up  avoid  taboo  like leprosy  but definitely check out  mad men .   ,0
during a kurt weill celebration in brooklyn  where do we go from here  was finally unearthed for a screening . it is amazing that a motion picture  from any era  that has weill  gershwin collaborations can possibly be missing from the screens . the score stands tall  and a cd of the material  with gershwin and weill  only underscores its merits  which are considerable . yes  the film has its problems  but the score is not one of them . ratoff is not in his element as the director of this musical fantasy  and fred macmurray cannot quite grasp the material . then  too  the  modern  segment is weakly written . but the fantasy elements carry the film to a high mark  as does the work of the two delightful leading ladies  joan leslie and june haver . both have the charm that this kind of work desperately needs to work . as a world war ii salute to our country  s history  albeit in a  never was  framework  the film has its place in hollywood musical history and should be available for all to see and to find its considerable merits .  ,1
i was honestly surprised by alone in the dark . it was so bad  i could hardly believe what i was seeing . there are no characters  just a few stereotypes wandering around and getting killed . the extent of the character development was giving each character a name and an occupation  and that  s about it . there was no real plot  and none of the characters seemed to have any motivation . in fact  many action scenes just began on their own  coming from nowhere with a pounding techno track . while i was watching this movie i kept asking  where is this happening  what  s going on   the acting was high school drama quality  with stiff wooden delivery  as though the actors were reading from cue cards without comprehending their lines . their trouble delivering lines was made even more obvious by horrible sound design . adr sounded like it was recorded in an open room . the actors were constantly taking obvious care to hit their marks  looking almost robotic in their movements . so  these listless automatons are whisked through a series of implausible and confusing scenarios  often without even the benefit of transition scenes . they were here  now they  re there . this was happening  now that  s happening . random scenes with little rhyme or reason . i had a lot of fun watching it . definitely not worth nine bucks though .  ,0
rohmer returns to his historical dramas in the real story of grace elliot  an englishwoman who stayed in france during the apex of the french revolution . one always suspected that rohmer was a conservative  but who knew he was such a red  blooded reactionary . if you can put aside rohmer  s unabashed defense of the monarchy  and that is not an easy thing to do  given that  for instance  the french lower classes are portrayed here as hideous louts   this is actually an elegant  intelligent and polished movie . lacking the money for a big cinematic recreation of   th century france  rohmer has instead the actors play against obvious painted cardboards . it is a blatantly artificial conceit  but it somehow works . and newcomer lucy russell succeeds in making sympathetic a character that shouldn  t be .  ,1

i voted this a   out of   simply because it is the best animated story i have been able to see in quite some time . the animation is stunning . the artwork behind each and every landscape was beautiful . from the colors to the lighting to the not standard fare of artistry . i was amazed . moving beyond the beauty on the screen  you are immersed in a storyline that is at once timeless and at the same turn fresh . character development is brief yet these touchstone moments are exactly what is needed to clue the viewer in to what and why and how the character has come to where they stand . i  m impressed with the entire affair and think this is a must see for the entire family .  ,1
this is one of those movies that made me feel strongly for the need of making movies at all . generally speaking  i am a fan of movies based on worthy true stories . and this one is great  besides meryl  s performance which has gained a lot of recognition and praise  the movie  s greatest asset is the story it is based on . the riveting tale of a couple who suffer social and legal torture  after having undergone enormous emotional pain at the unexpected and brutal death of their infant child is really an eye  opening fable that exposes the inhumane side of fellow humans  and uncovers the barbarism of a very refined and lawful society . it is interesting to see how people who consider themselves as kind and intelligent people  the emotional jury ladies in the movie for example  are in reality nothing more than selfish dupes who would  for their dogmatic beliefs and prejudices  shut their brains to any deliberation and contemplation even in the light of all facts pointing very clearly against their opinions . the other face of the so  called  civilized  society that the movie exposes is the apathy to the pain of fellow human beings  needless to say  this is very general  even though this specific tale unfolds in australia   that goes as far as becoming a true cruelty . must see if you are willing to take something serious and perhaps thought  provoking .  ,1
  warning minor spoilers   br    br   i ran into this one partway through and watched from there  not knowing what it was or what the plot was . it certainly held my attention i didn  t know until the ending that it was based on a true story  the guy she used to do the dirty deed came out looking like a seriously nice guy who just got his head twisted around by a devious girl i have to question how true to life that portrayal is . anyone who would murder a husband and wife as they slept just can  t be entirely nice . still  i did have some sympathy for him  as he had been set up and taken advantage of that much was made clear .  br    br   my main complaint is with the ending  here comes the biggest spoiler  skip this paragraph if you don  t want to learn it  . a few minutes before it ended  there seemed no way for the truth to be discovered . the way it got discovered was in a  sting  operation  but my question is how did the police get convinced to go along with it  the movie didn  t show us that  and it seemed a bit too convenient absent the explanation of how they were persuaded to do it .  br    br   i think the way they handled that was done for dramatic purposes  as the omission of the explanation lent an aura of suspense to the crucial scene which otherwise wouldn  t have been there  we would already have known what the scene was about  and what was going on with brad in it  .  br    br   otherwise  this is a pretty good film i give it     . it made me think . now i  m interested to find out the facts of the real case .  br    br   one more thing the movie was done in     . some of the reviews here seem to be treating it as a more recent movie .  br    br   p . s . meadow sisto is lovely . i hadn  t seen her before . she can act a little  too  always a plus in her line of work  lol  .  ,1

there seems to be little in the way of middle ground where watch on the rhine is concerned . one either likes it very much  applauding its sincerity  its liberal point of view and fine acting  or else loathes its obvious propaganda  mediocre dialogue  cardboard characters and overall tendentiousness . i fall very much in the latter category  and found the film and play    concerning the activities of european refugees in washington during wartime   a crushing bore  worthwhile mostly for the acting  and even then only intermittently . that author lillian hellman was on the side of the angels is irrelevant . her plays were written for people who shared her point of view  and she seldom explored ideas that weren  t already held by the author and audience except to point out how dreadful the  other side  is . even when i find myself in one hundred percent agreement with what she has to say    as in rhine   i still can  t stand the way she says it . her characters are unreal  and while her ear for dialogue shows a certain facility for the way people talk she possesses no real brilliance or originality . she really had nothing new to say . i thoroughly agree with the late mary mccarthy  s long overdue dismantling of hellman reputation some years ago . for those who think the theatre is dead or in extremis and yearn for the good old days  i urge a peek at watch on the rhine  as bad in its way as angels in america  which only goes to show that the theatre had one foot in the grave sixty years ago .  ,0
a charming romantic comedy . the plot is a little too complicated   i tried to summarize it three times and i can  t . suffice to say it  s worth seeing . the movie is funny  beautiful   the plot is totally unrealistic but it works . everybody in the movie is so nice and everything looks so great   it creates a sweet  romantic feel through the entire film .  br    br   the acting is great   robert downey jr . and cybill shepherd are in top form and enjoying every second of it . ryan o  neal and mary stuart masterson are just ok but fine . if you  re a sucker for good  sweet sentimental films  like me   catch this one . also downey looks great in his underwear   br    br   extra bonuses   the title song sung by johnny mathis and another great song  after all  sung by cher and peter cetera .  ,1
i see a lot of really negative posts by people who wrote in august  though the movie was not released in the us  at least  until the middle of september . maybe these are unhappy expats living in s . korea who saw it early . i am in the us and just saw it today . i thought the special effects were excellent  better than the trailer . the story was non  western  but i think we are all used to this from many other movies . it wasn  t at all hard to follow . the acting by the leads was weak  but other people were quite good . there was humor throughout  too . i rated it at  because i had a good time watching it  which is what i went for .  ,1
like last year  i didn  t manage to sit through the whole thing . okay  so chris rock as a host was a good choice because he was vaguely engaging . or rather  out of all the total bores packed into the theatre  he at least wasn  t in the top   most boring . a lot of the presenters  on the other hand  were in this coveted top   . i hadn  t known that the whole thing had been done by autocue  although i knew it was scripted  but it was really terrible to see these supposedly good actors unable to insert expression  look away from the cue and stumble over simple words  natalie portmanif there  s no director  she  s gone  . the night of fancy dresses and boring speeches was long and tedious  beyonce knowles butchered some good songs and there were very few decent acceptance speeches and clips . adam sandler wins the worst presenter award .  br    br   for helping me write this review i  d like to thank my mum  my dad  my lawyers and my pedicurist for all believing in me  and i  d like to point out that i have a high metabolism and of course i haven  t been starving myself for a month . i  m not going to cry . . . thank you .  ,0

i watched the mccoys reunion and was glad to see richard crenna and kathleen nolan and tony martinez    to see them now was wonderful  because i always watched the show growing up so when the tv said that there was going to be a reunion i was so excited     the only thing i could not figure out is why lydia reed  hassie mccoy  and michael winkelman  little luke  was not on there . i know that walter brennan had died . so i got on my computer and tried to find out about them and found this site so if there is anyone out there that can tell me what ever happened to lydia reed  hassie mccoy  and michael winkelman  little luke i would be thankful    i have searched everywere and no luck . the only thing i could find out about michael winkelman is he was supposed to be born in     . this show had value and morals each show gave a lesson to be learned . the shows today dont have that . the whole cast was incredable the only thing better than finding out obout them would be to meet them so since that is impossible if there is anyone that can help please do    thank you glenda  ,1
this is a very moving picture about  forty  something best friends in a small england town . one finds a passionate loves and a new beginning with a younger piano instructor  when tragedy strikes and hearts are changed forever . definitely a film to have a box of tissues with you  a powerful piece of work . this is definitely one of my favorite films of all time .  br    br   spoiler    spoiler alert   spoiler     br    br   the main character is taken by her young  handsome piano instructor and a passionate romance blossoms . her two jealous  friends  play an immature prank which quickly leads to tragedy . she loses her love and her friends in one foul swoop . in the end a unexpected surprise pulls them back together .  in my opinion her forgiveness is not warranted   ,1
the      s tv series bewitched owes it  s idea from this movie . this is the movie that jimmy stewart  kim novak made right after they were cast together in vertigo by alfred hitchcock . this one is not as obsessive as that one but novak is just as captivating .  br    br   this was jack lemmons   th movie and he is good in support here as well as ernie kovacs . the movie has a lot of good things about it . hermine gingold is very good in this movie  almost as good in support here as she was in the music man . the cast is very solid .  br    br   this movie has a late      s new york city feel  a cat that is as hexing as any feline in any movie . it is well worth watching as it is a love story with all the emotion of any   a little magic too boot .  br    br   it is not vertigo but i think because it followed that movie  viewers then did not rate it as good as it deserved  sure am glad that william asher saw it  so that the      s series got created . i am not so glad about what will ferrell did to it on the big screen  this movie is much better than that .  ,1

this kind of  inspirational  saccharine is enough to make you sick . it telegraphs its sentiments like the biggest semaphore on earth . it removes from the audience its own interpretation and feeling by making the choices for it . the big finish is swimming in weeping orchestration that must supposed to work like jumper cables on a dead car i guess you  d need such prompting to feel if you  re stupid enough to watch a film as simple  minded and sappy as this . streep glows and you wonder if she really has the depth of feeling on display or if it  s just that    a display  switched on and off like a light . because i can  t for the life of me see how she could possibly find life in such a dud of film . even though it  s based on a true story  and an inspirational one at that i  m sure  the set  up  execution and performances play like a third  rate tv movie or half  witted high school drama .  ,0
william hurt scuba diving scientist    us agents running the investigation abroad  the sick contaminated man kicking butt after falling   feet on his back and running away  sniper missing and not killing hurt  just wounding him  but the second  kill  shot is dead on  waste of time . to compare this to falling down as other reviewers did is ridiculous . oh and by the end of the movie they decide to start wearing gloves on their hands except for the  evil  agent and hurt decides to kill him by giving him the  virus handshake  . what  btw . . . when did imdb require   lines of text  i  m just babbling here . doesn  t this just dillute the content of reviews if you are required to have x amount of lines   ,0
you get  writers together  have each write a different story with a different genre  and then you try to make one movie out of it . it  s action  it  s adventure  it  s sci  fi  it  s western  it  s a mess . sorry  but this movie absolutely stinks .  .  is giving it an awefully high rating . that said  it  s movies like this that make me think i could write movies  and i can barely write .  ,0
it could have been a marvelous story based on the ancient races of cat people  but it wasn  t .  br    br   this work could have been just that marvelous and replete with mythological references which kept my fascination fueled . the lead characters  charles brady played by brian krause and his mother mary  played by alice krige  were shallowly done  had no depth of personality and were hardly likable or drawing . not even mdchen amick  who played tanya robertson   s character fit into that description .  br    br   however  as i  ve said many times before  when you adapt a stephen king novel for tv  you simply must take into account the fact that his books aren  t written for tv  and his screenplay talent sadly lacks the fire and depth he exhibits as a novelist .  br    br   this is another botched attempt to take the magick of stephen king writing  whether that is of his novels or an original screenplay . to simply cut and paste his work onto the small screen . his novels get completely bastardized in the process and all you end up creating is a nice movie nothing less but certainly nothing more . his screenplays are hit and miss . unfortunately  this screenplay translation was a miss .  br    br   sorry  sorry  sorry movie .  br    br   this movie gets a  .     from . . .  br    br   the fiend  .  ,0
cashing in on the  demons  meets  clergy  trend of the late    s  early    s that most prominently included the triptych of  rosemary  s baby    the exorcist   and  the omen    the sentinel  is an addition that  s just as good  albeit the most overlooked of the lot  . in a way  it combines the best elements of those films and tosses in a dash of polanski  s  the tenant   which came out the same year  for good measure . a new york model unable to commit to her lawyer boyfriend takes up residence in a moss  coated townhouse that initially seems like the perfect locale she meets a wily old coot of a neighbor  the brilliant burgess meredith   plus the other off  center tenants . kept awake by loud noises above her apartment  she soon discovers that a mute priest and herself are the only residents in the otherwise deserted building . from there  director michael winner   death wish   kicks this supernatural thriller into gear  and there is a devilish glee to the hallucinogenic tortures he inflicts on his heroine . aided by a brilliant ensemble cast  a subtle storyline  and excellent makeup fx by dick smith   the exorcist     the sentinel  is a genuinely creepy horror flick .  ,1
i saw this movie in the theater when it came out . i grew up in scottsdale and i went to arizona state and really enjoyed seeing locations where i spent so much time . i remember at the time thinking that barbara  s venture into more of a rock sound  actually r and b  to my ears  was a successful one . i was never a fan of kris  s singing until his last effort for new west . as a songwriter and an actor  though  he has serious chops  imho . i think it is a fine romance . i like it better than the judy garland version and never saw selznick  s janet gaynor original .  br    br   i do believe that they made some changes in this long  awaited dvd release . among other things  i recall the helicopter shot which reveals a packed sun devil stadium being longer and more dramatic . i wish they had done a better job writing music for kris or god forbid  put some of his original songs in there .  br    br   along those lines i have some information from a primary source that says that the music was a problem for kris and barbara . while doing interviews for my own new music documentary  rocking the boat a musical conversation and journey  i interviewed stephen bruton  a fine singer  songwriter  guitarist with close professional and personal ties to kris  bonnie raitt  and delbert mcclinton  among many others . stephen was in  speedway   the john norman character  s band . kris was having a real hard time turning what was essentially a pop score into something that could pass for rock . stephen was and is kris  s friend and long time band member . there was tension on the set and at one point the band was barking at kris in barbara  s presence . she remarked to the effect that the band shouldn  t talk to him like that . kris came right back to the effect that they were his friends and they were rock and roll  in the end  barbara came around and decided to use kris  s band  s live performances in the movie and specifically sited stephen  s role in making things work . i gained even greater respect for her as an artist upon hearing this story . much is made of her as a diva . what she is is a pro . and i am not gay . not that there is anything wrong with that .  ,1
this adaptation of pearl s . buck  s film is certainly a classic . a true hollywood epic  it has all the things a great hollywood film has birth  death  happiness  sadness  exhilaration  despair  and so on . there is only one thing that irks me . i know it was a sign of the times  but neither of the two main characters are played by asian actors . paul muni was a great actor  and he does an admirable job as wang lung  the owner of a farm in china . luise rainier plays olan . she does not even look chinese  i think she tried to get the role  but they should have put anna may wong in the role . i know why they didn  t  and ms . rainier is very good in the film  but they hardly tried to make her look  authentic  . stillm its a great film  especially if you read the book  i did in high school  decades ago  . its a must see  just look beyond the casting . i think you can .  ,1
how this movie got made with a supposedly    million budget and without being completely retooled is beyond me . the storyline and dialogue are beyond amateurish . characters say things no real person would ever say and almost never react to things that were said before . no one seems to be grounded in the real world . the acting of the leads is fine given that the writing is such a dud . . . but several actors in supporting roles really drag the production down . the hero  s hair probably should  ve gotten its own credit  it was so oddly attention  grabbing . . . not to mention that it gave one of the better performances in the pic . finally  for a movie about l . a . being besieged by giant reptiles  this film is shockingly boring . what a shame  if you do see this  your mind will be constantly racing  thinking up ways that you could have taken the sfx scenes and built a far better movie around them . sadly  it wouldn  t have taken much .  ,0
this show was a landmark in american comedy as it was the first sitcom to star an all afro  american cast . sadly though it was never broad  casted on british tv .  br    br   the evans family are a poor afro  american family living in a tower block . the dad is called james  he tries to run the house  but his wife florida always gets the better of him . the three children are the artistic jj  the moody thelma and the young intellectual child michael . always coming into the house is florida  s gossipy friend willona .  br    br   i watched two episodes of this show on youtube  black jesus and sex and the evans family  the only two on the site  . you may be thinking why has an english viewer watched a series that has never been shown or hardly heard of in his country . the answer is this . in      britains first all black sitcom came out called  the fosters  only two series were made and it now seems forgotten . but i watched an episode and was really impressed . then i learnt that the scripts were identical to  good times  . they were exactly the same characters but with different names  sam foster was the dad  his wife was pearl foster and the three children were sonny  a young lenny henry   shirley and benjamin . pearl  s gossipy friend was vilma .  to read about the fosters  i have wrote a review about that  . whilst watching  good times  only two things annoyed me . first off was the opening theme tune  awful  and secondly was the audience laughter . i like audience laughter  but in this somebody would say a slightly funny line and the audience would go mad and start clapping . apart from that it was a very funny show . let  s hope more episodes turn up on youtube and lets hope that someone will release  the fosters  on dvd in england .  br    br   best episode sex and the evans family  series  episode  . the foster  s episode of it was called sex in the black community . the other episode i saw  black jesus was a title of one episode of  the fosters   ,1
an american in paris is a wonderful musical about an american painter living in paris for inspiration . he meets a rich woman who admires his paintings on the street and she believes she can get his work to be even more popular to the public  e . g . in a museum . golden globe nominated gene kelly as the artist jerry mulligan is just perfect at both singing and especially dancing . he also meets the main girl lise bouvier  leslie caron  who is engaged to his best friend . he can  t help his feelings for this girl  even after he finds out who she is engaged to . filled with nice romance and wonderful song and dance  this is a very good musical film . it may drag slightly with his dancing dream sequence  i . e . the american in paris ballet  but there is a good happy ending . it won the oscars for best art direction  set decoration  best cinematography  best costume design  best music  scoring of a musical picture  best writing  story and screenplay and best picture  and it was nominated for best director for vincente minnelli and best film editing  it was nominated the bafta for best film from any source  and it won the golden globe for best motion picture  musical  comedy  and it was nominated for best director for vincente millenni  liza  s father  . gene kelly was number   on the    movie stars  and he was number   on    years     stars  men   i got rhythm  was number   on    years     songs  the film was number  on    years of musicals  it was number   on    years     passions  it was number   on    years     movies  and it was number   on the    greatest musicals . very good   ,1
this is an excellent film dealing with a potentially exploitative subject with great sensitivity . anne reid  previously best known in the uk for her tv roles including  dinnerladies   a victoria wood scripted series on in  company catering workers  if you  re wondering   gives a performance of finely judged understatement as may  a late    s bereaved mother of two chattering class adults in an inner  london borough . her husband toots  peter vaughan  dies on their visit to the male of the latter species  bobby   and we see the pair being rather casually greeted by bobby and his family . may  s teacher daughter paula  cathryn bradshaw  lives nearby  however  and the relationship between may and paula initially appears closer . thus when may decides she cannot live in her own home and comes back to london  she is able to stay in paula  s house and do some child  minding of paula  s more appreciative offspring .  br    br   it is on may  s visits to bobby  s house that she embarks on an affair with darren  a mid    s friend of bobby who is working on a house extension . in what may be the first mainstream british film to so portray it  it is may and not darren  daniel craig  who initiates the encounter  and  at least to begin with  it seems that the relationship is founded on mutual respect . there is no explicit sexual content  at least in the dvd i saw differences in the imdb cast list suggests the existence of other versions   and the physical basis of the affair is handled directly but not exploitatively . more strongly portrayed is the relationship between may and daughter paula  a recent convert to  therapy and self  exploration   who announces that mummy has never been supportive of her . paula is also darren  s lover  and when she finds may  s explicit but rather poor drawings of darren and may together  things go downhill in dramatic but controlled fashion . only in an english film  perhaps  could a daughter announce that she is going to hit her mother  politely ask her to stand up  and duly wallop her .  br    br   in the mean time  may is being drawn into a putative relationship with a decent but older  of her own generation  member of paula  s writing group . the contrast between the ensuing unwanted intercourse and her affair with darren is clearly made it is at that point that may starts to acquiesce to paula  and darren  s worm begins to turn  he reveals on cocaine that he may have been after her money  if not all along  but for some of the ride  . so may finds herself superfluous to both of her children  s needs  and finally does return home  but later leaves on a jet plane for pastures new  .  br    br   the film  s strength is that it portrays with unflinching but sympathetic truth the nature of contemporary adult parent  sibling relationships  where bereavement may leave the surviving parent feeling more alone than if they had no  one to care for them . this is not new  but the openness of the portrayal of sexual need in the over    s may well be . the darkness of the film  s content  from a screenplay by hanif kureishi  stands in contrast to the way in which it is lit  it seems to be perpetual summer   and the overall mood is uplifting  it could so easily have been yet another piece set in a dour and rainy england . the ending is perhaps under  written  as we don  t know where may is going or for how long  perhaps she  s shirley valentine with a pension  she  s certainly no picasso . anne reid is  however  revealed as a fine actor whose professional life will surely have changed forever . like julie andrews in torn curtain  said by paul newman    there goes your mary poppins read dinnerladies image for good  .  br    br    yes  he announced oct     as the new james bond .  ,1
first of all  i have to say i have worked for blockbuster and have seen quite a few movies to the point its tough for me to find something i haven  t seen . taking this into account  i want everyone to know that this movie was by far the worst film ever made  it made me pine for gigli  my boss  s daughter  and any other piece of junk you  ve ever seen . belyt must be out of his mind  i  ve only found one person who liked it and even they couldn  t tell me what the movie was about . if you are able to decipher this movie and are able to tell me what it was about you have to either be the writer or a fortune teller because there  s any other way a person could figure this crap out .  br    br   for the love of g  d stay away   ,0
i think its time for seagal to go quietly into the night . what i have just seen makes all his direct to video releases in the last few years look like his early    s smash hits in comparison .  br    br   a secret bio lab is making a new kind of drug that jacks up a human  s adrenaline system to the point where they become psychopathic killers or something . somehow seagal is supposed to stop the infection or its the end of the world . . . or something . seagal also went through hit squads like jellybeans  every time i look up he was commanding a new face so it kinda got hard to follow character development as well i know steven  s athsma prevent him from yelling at the top of his lungs but even so why is he constantly being dubbed by people who sound nothing like him  usually the films plot and action sequences can save it from being a total waste of time but this was not even close . like i said  it was more of a horror movie with a lot of blood and shank stabbing rather than straight up fighting . the problem was it wasn  t really scary and seagal looked completely out of place because the infected people were supposed to have speed of light movement yet the   year old    lb seagal killed them all singlehandedly  i guess the lone highlight of the movie was the first   minutes where the new recruits ask seagal to come to the strip club with them .  br    br    out of    ,0
warning  no plot spoilers ahead  but movie spoilers nonetheless . . .  my significant other rented this for me thinking it would be a terrific romance with an all  star cast . wow  very  very wrong . this movie is an overdone  overwrought  and overly sentimental excuse to theatrically release a student film   years after it was shot  the copyright date on the box said      yet during the very first flashback sequence i was looking at the clothes and hairdos that were supposed to be the early     s  and noticed that the girls especially were wearing late   s  early   s dresses and hairdos . it looked as if it had been shot a good   or   years before the rest of the film  i tried to convenience myself that it was a flashback  and therefore supposed to look old  but it looked wwwwwwwaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyyyy more   s than   s or even   st century trying to be   s . . . then an adult coworker of the lead character turns up  and he looks just like the boy featured in the flashback sequences  yet it  s a different  much older character whose youth is featured in the flashbacks  . i was completely confused until i saw in the special features the short film included  it was all the flashback sequences  shot in     as a complete student film of the same title as this movie  it also features commentary that includes the little boy all grown up  and indeed acting the co  worker in the     scenes  . thus  this movie is just a shell of story woven around an old  re  cut student film put together as an obvious excuse to get it up to theatrical running time . the shell story  shot in      is mostly about a man who has lost his wife and finds healing and redemption at the dance class that he promises a dying man he will attend in his stead  something about a promise made by the dying man in the early    s to his girl that they would meet on the  fifth day of the fifth month of the fifth year of the new millennium  an excuse to shoot the segments around the old film in       these new scenes and plot might have been ok except the awful  overly sentimental score that repeats ad nauseum over almost every single new scene and the clichd action that permeates the new movie . don  t bother . there  s a reason why you  ve never heard of this movie even though it has a well  known cast  it  s terrible .  ,0
a lot of talk has been made about  psychological westerns   but this is one of the very few that is truly in that genre . it has big name stars who perform very well  but it is the director who makes this such a good movie . stewart granger loses his british safari hunter stereotype to play a haggard retired buffalo hunter who is revered in the west as one of the best . robert taylor plays the upstart  in contrast to the usual young upstart  taylor  s character is middle aged  too   who wants to slaughter buffalo  and lures granger into business with him . they hire two other big name actors  lloyd nolan and russ tamblyn  into being their skinners . granger is haunted by the buffalo he has killed  knowing that he may be to blame if they become extinct  knowing if they become extinct  the native american way of life will greatly suffer . taylor soon reveals a sadistic side  but it is a realistic saidism  unlike the one dimensional sadists of modern film  created by nerds and dorks . he is insecure  and needs human companionship . still  he won  t stop at murder . the end pits the two against each other  with a startling conclusion . the psychological effects of what they  re doing are well depicted .  ,1
i claim no matter how hard i seek i  ll never find a better movie version of  othello  . if you love kenneth branagh  s magnificent masterpieces  much ado about nothing        and  hamlet        as much as i do i  m dead certain you  ll also find oliver parker  s  othello  irresistible . laurence fishburne has been in a various splendid roles during his career . he was quite terrific in  boys n the hood         i  ve always considered his amusing role of furious styles as his very greatest achievement . that was  of course  way before i saw this .  br    br   he plays the part of othello and he is probably in the most challenging role of his whole career but he does a brilliant  fantastic job . irne jacob is absolutely charming desdemona and kenneth branagh is just simply phenomenal in a most fascinating role of the story  s crooked  manipulate villain iago . marvelous  othello  is part of the absolute elite among shakespeare  s ingenious works . it deals with his favorite topics crookedness  envy  deceitfulness and jealousy . this movie adaptation is certainly one of the finest films i  ve seen that  s based on william shakespeare  s plays .  ,1
i  m watching this on the star world network overseas which buys american and canadian series that last one or two seasons like the jane show . i thought of how many female lead comedy shows im actually able to watch on my own  there  s lucy  bewitched  i dream of jeanie  the one with barbara feldman   and then my mind goes kind of blank i cannot think of any others  the women are all supporting roles not the lead . so for me  the jane show is in pretty good company . one thing i just thought of though . i  ve watched several things made in canada  and i never recall any thing being filmed in a regular tv series that shows snow  it  s all made at the height of summer  lol  granted it  s a great place to live climate wise in the summer but you would think  they would show a little bit of canada in the winter since that  s part of the lifestyle there also . i mean sctv  just for laughs come to mind as two comedy shows that lasted a long time filmed in canada and very little or none is shot with snow present even though they both do a lot of outdoor shots . i digress but i kind of chuckle at jane and her obviously liberal ways being accused of racism to her neighbor  and i like the bald guy and his craziness  i found it on par with a uk series called the it crowd  i think  another office comedy with a female lead . not by any means the best comedy ever but for a guy to say he can watch it alone  thats saying something . if i was with my wife she might really enjoy it since it addresses sex in the office and stuff like that so might be a good light comedy for couples to watch .  of   .  ,1
i feel blessed to own what is known as the worst steven seagal movie ever made . i knew i was on to something special when steven opened his mouth and someone else  s voice came out . by the middle of the film my eyes were beginning to hurt and i was almost falling out of my chair with uncontrollable laughter .  br    br   steven is steven  with an ever changing voice  and totally unbelievable in his role  as always  . who the hell lets people with bad nappy  hair pony tail mullets into the forces anyway  he also always writes himself into totally unbelievable love interests with women at least   years his junior . the supporting actors all look like they  ve been shot in the dark  btw  did they shoot this movie in the dark with just a penlight torch for lighting   br    br   this is truly abominable in every way possible . invite all your friends around and make a social event out of it  this one  s truly special .  ,0
this is a great example of a good  dumb movie . no  it is not high art by any means . nor is the script anywhere close to a woody allen or mel brooks . but so what  the killer tomatoes series  four movies and a cartoon series  are basically good  natured romps gleefully trampling on the kind of territory the zuckers ruled before they switched to making serious flicks .  br    br   as the title suggests  this fourth installment of the killer tomatoes trilogy deals with the killer tomatoes plot against france . in this case  professor gangrene  john astin  s  rd time in the role  has a plan to rule france through an ancient prophecy about the return of the rightful king of france . steve lundquist returns as igor  a humanoid tomato who wants to be a sportscaster and who just happens to be a dead ringer for the long  lost true king of france . obviously he also plays the aforementioned l  l t k of f  happily skewering the french language .  br    br   opposing them is the fearless fuzzy tomato  like the others  ft was introduced in the second film and would be a main character in the cartoon  and his human allies . mark price  recently unemployed as a result of the conclusion of the family ties series  plays a thinly disguised version of himself  passing himself as  michael j fox  as a way to win the girl of his dreams . and angela visser is a dream as marie  gleefully bouncing between unabashed virginal sexuality and borderline psychosis . oh that the former miss netherlands had had more of a film career  another returning member of the killer tomatoes stock company is rick rockwell  now best known as the hapless title subject of  who wants to marry a millionaire    . like co  creator john de bello  rockwell works both in front of and behind the camera in this series .  br    br   what can you say about jon de bello  not much  really  except that he had a singular vision and managed to pull it off and  having done that  has apparently dropped into obscurity . john  if you ever see this  thanks for giving us the killer tomatoes .  br    br   the script is heavily but not obnoxiously aware that this is just a movie . like return of the killer tomatoes  the action occasionally veers off the set and into the middle of the film crew . and mark price has a funny forum to complain about his own lack of success compared to his former costar michael j fox . this is the biggest budgeted of all the killer tomatoes flicks and is a nice send  off to the series . okay  the show then moved to fox kids as a cartoon series  which was also quite clever   but cartoons just aren  t the same .  ,1
i wasn  t really fond of the first  cube  movie . it was a good idea  but the annoying acting and characters always kept me from liking it too much . didn  t really feel the need to see its sequel but when i heard they were making a third movie that would act as more of a prequel to the original . i was intrigued  thinking that maybe they would fix some of the original  s problems and provide us with a memorable cast of characters . well i thought wrong .  br    br    cube zero  starts well enough by introducing us with the two characters in charge of watching and maintaining the never  ending maze of traps that plagues the people in the cube . the filmmakers succeed in providing a sense of mystery with the establishment of the two men  s daily routine . several questions are created from it  concerning the reason why people are send there and also the true nature of the ones who run the entire operation . all of which are left entirely to the viewer . the acting was a bit weak but all in all the movie  s first half moved relatively well .  br    br   with the story moving on  one of the two  watchers  begins to develop serious doubts about what he is doing . and later decides to go and help a group of the people trapped . here is where everything rapidly starts to dissolve into dull cheese .  br    br   sent by the people who run the cube program we are introduced to the character  jax  . along with his two underlings play a major reason as to why this movie is failure . to start of  jax  looks and talks more like a third rate villain taken directly from a james bond movie complete with the ever  popular  glass eye  that alone ruins any atmosphere created by the first half  s relatively nice pace . whats more is that it begins to feel more like a comedy rather than a serious movie . with some incredibly corny lines  perhaps the screenwriter got bored and didn  t care . the acting itself degrades to a further low when the former  watcher  meets the group in the cube . the entire interaction is painful to watch as is everything else following it .  br    br   again failing to impress on anything but weak characters  dialog and acting  cube zero  is a waste of time for those searching for a good horror movie .  ,0
in france  it  s considered polite from french critics to genuflect to the apparently cohesive chain of films brian de palma left behind him . however  a good proportion of his films are marred by bombastic effects  carrie          the fury         scarface        without mentioning his borrowings from hitchcock . here  in  dressed to kill   it  s impossible not to think of  vertigo        for the long sequence in the museum while the key moment in the lift makes inevitably think of the shower anthology sequence in  psycho        . about our involved film  i don  t want to revive the old debate does de palma rip off hitchcock  instead  i would tend to be generous and to classify  dressed to kill  in the category of de palma  s winners alongside  sisters        and  obssession        . with however some reservations and they  re the ones i previously enumerated which fuel the bickering between de palma  s rabid fans and his detractors .  br    br   if there  s one sure thing in  dressed to kill  which can generate general agreement among film  lovers  it  s de palma  s virtuosity in directing . he wields his camera just like a filmmaker expert is supposed to do . his sophisticated camera work brilliantly fuels the suspense which entails a rise of the tension and a discomforting aura . the audience is easily glued in front of the screen . this is helped by the use of several long silent sequences during which everything depends on looks and gestures . by the way  in  psycho   there were also long silent  suspenseful parts . . .  br    br   but the main drawback in de palma  s     vintage is that the quality of the plot can  t be found wanting and appears to be a rehash of many formulaic  corny ingredients pertaining to an incalculable number of murder stories . the prostitute is the sole witness of the crime . then  she  s suspected by the police and has to act on her own  with a little help from the victim  s son from the scene in the subway onwards   to track down the murderer and to prove her innocence . apart from the fact that de palma uses a type of character who for once isn  t demeaned at all  it  s a menu which smells the reheated . and the filmmaker ends his film on a sequence that echoes to the opening one . yes  it  s superbly filmed but when one discovers its real function  one figures  it  s almost gratuitous filler  . perhaps de palma wanted to stretch his film beyond one hour and a half when at this time the viewer knows  and even before  who the killer is .  br    br   the two central mainsprings in de palma  s set of themes articulate hinges on manipulation and voyeurism . the latter theme is well present in  dressed to kill  from the first scene onwards which makes the film almost look like a soft porn movie . and the filmmaker isn  t afraid to film his main actress and wife nancy allen in her underwear . i find his approach about this theme rather doubtful . but maybe the first sequence was conceived to be a mirror of the viewer and de palma wanted to stir his peeping tom side .  br    br   i don  t want to demean at all de palma  s work . his prestigious work in directing which entails a communicative treat to film redeems the global weakness of the story and its doubtful aspects . twenty six years after  the controversy he aroused amid movie  goers isn  t ready to subside .  ,1
there is a reason this went straight to video  the story is smarmy  nick cage plays johnny in a sleazy way  sex in churches  and other scenes that border on tasteless  like the scene in the laundry room  taint this movie . judge reinhold as the cuckold is okay  but the movie itself with its themes of degradation and revenge are not well done . but it is a good film for trivia contests  because so few people saw it .  ,0
the question  when one sees a movie this bad  is not necessarily   how did a movie this bad get made   or even   why did i see this awful in the first place   but   what have i learned from this experience   here  s what i learned  br    br    just because the  rules  of horror movies have been catalogued and satirized countless times in the last ten years doesn  t mean someone won  t go ahead and make a movie that uses all of them  without a shred of humor or irony .  br    br    if your movie has to be described as loosely based on the video game  you have script problems .  br    br    the black character may not always die first  but the asian character does always know kung  fu .  br    br    while you may be proud that you figured out how to do the  the matrix effect  on a budget  that doesn  t necessarily mean you should use it over and over again ad nausea .  br    br    being ron howard  s brother does not guarantee choice roles .  br    br    whenever a scene doesn  t edit together  just use some footage from the video game  no one will notice .  br    br    if your cousin  s rap  metal band offers to write your movie  s theme for free  politely decline .  br    br    zombie movies are not about people killing zombies . they  re about zombies killing people  preferably in the most gruesome way possible . that  s what makes them scary .  br    br    white people who can pay      to get to a rave deserve to die .  br    br    if you find an old book  it will tell you everything you need to know . anything else you will figure out on your own two lines after someone asks   what was that   or   where are we    br    br    bare breasts are not horror movie panacea .  br    br    a helicopter boom shot and a licensing deal with sega magically transforms your movie from  student film  to  major studio release  . try it   br    br    just because you can name  drop all three  living dead  movies  that does not make you george romero . or even paul w . s . anderson .  br    br   i  ve seen worse movies  but only because i  ve seen  mortal kombat annihilation .   ,0
the most succinct way to describe ride with the devil is with but one word authenticity . i will not rehash what has already been said about this wonderous film  but i would like to say how much the historical research and painstaking attention to detail the crew no doubt went through was appreciated by this filmgoer .  br    br   as a student of history familiar with the period and setting of this film  i must say that this production is one of the most accurate fictional films regarding  bleeding kansas  . yes there were liberties taken on the actual events  as all fiction is apt to do . but the overall feel of the film is genuine . authentic costumes  authentic attitudes  no pc hindsight here  even the actors look authentic . even jewel kilcher  who has a small part in the film  looked like she stepped form a mid   th century photograph .  br    br   a few viewers i talked with have expressed their incredulity at the stylized dialog . they cannot believe that   th century farmers would  talk like poets  .  br    br   what they don  t realize is that in this age of verbal slobbishness  the american public public of the   th century was a surprisingly literate and eloquent bunch . these people were raised on shakespeare and the king james version of the bible . the screenwriters reconstructed the most likely verbal styles of these people  judging from documentation of the time . the stylized dialog just adds to the magical atmosphere of the film .  br    br   but in addition to a historical document  this film works on a visceral level as well . beautifully photographed and performed  it harkens back to the days of the great western epics . the raid on lawrence  kansas  done so many times before in so many other  lesser films is portrayed with a sense of urgency that puts the viewer right in the midst of the action .  br    br   romance  adventure  moral and ethical conflict . this film has everything a discerning moviegoer could want .  br    br   in a year that was dominated by overhyped garbage like american beauty  this great artwork was buried by an indifferent studio system . but i am certain that ride with the devil will be given it  s due in the coming years . please rent this film . you will not be disappointed .  ,1
james stewart plays an fbi agent who began working with the agency before it was called the fbi and the story involves dealing with the ku klux klan  the prohibition era gangsters  world war ii german and japanese spies  etc . a continuously interesting picture covering   years of history far superior to any films being made these days .  br    br   of special interest to older viewers familiar with washington  dc . in a scene about   minutes into the movie    where james stewart finds out from vera miles that she  s expecting their first child    the scene was filmed in herzog  s seafood restaurant on the former washington waterfront  the only movie in which this historic location appears . shortly after taking office  president kennedy decided that southwest washington  a    black neighborhood  was an eyesore and ought to be torn down . by decree befitting his position of undisputed royalty  the entire area  including the popular waterfront restaurant district  but excluding  historic churches was reduced to rubble . black residents evicted from their homes relocated as best they could  and without federal assistance likewise businesses were simply put out of business  few re  locating . restaurant row was converted into a sidewalk  and washington had no waterfront  restaurants  seafood stands  boats  etc  for about   years . as a lifetime resident  the herzog restaurant scene was our   reason to see this fine movie again .  ,1
we start all of our reviews with the following information . my wife and i have seen nearly    movies per year for the past   years . recently  we were honored by receiving lifetime movie passes to any movie any time at no cost  so we can see whatever we want whenever we want . the point of this is that critics count for zero . your local critics or the national critics like ebert are really no different than you or me . the only difference is that they get to write about the movie and are forced to see hundreds of movies whether they want to or not . therefore  it is our belief that if you get your monies worth for two hours of enjoyment that is good enough for us  we never ever listen or read the critics . we only care about our friends and those who we know like the same things as us . well enough about that .  br    br   this movie is very good . not just good but very good . the critics are a bunch of morons . just because there is nudity and language they hated it . it was worth the price of ticket and that is all you can ask for . is that not right  every movie cannot be an academy award nominee . sharon stone is gorgeous and does a great job in the movie and it mystifies me as to what in the hell the critics want  ,1
please  do not waste any money on this movie . it really is nothing more than a boring german blair witch ripoff made by some high school kids . i couldn  t finish watching it  and usually i like watching all kinds of b  movies . how on earth could they find a distributor for it     funny however check out wikipedia for  dark area  . the guy who wrote the entry must be completely out of his mind . maybe he got loads of money from the producers . money that should have been spend on actors  camera and editing . even that wouldn  t have helped  since there is absolutely no interesting idea behind this film . unfortunately  dark area  has already gotten too much attention . please  director  producer and author of this movie  stop making movies like that . . . you are not doing yourself a favor . the world would be a better place without this film .  ,0
set in a post  apocalyptic environment  cyborgs led by warlord job rein over the human population . they basically keep them as livestock  as they need fresh human blood to live off . nea and her brother managed to survive one of their attacks when she was a kid  and years have past when she came face  to  face with the cyborgs again  but this time she  s saved by the cyborg gabriel  who was created to destroy all cyborgs . job and his men are on their way to capture a largely populated city  while nea  with revenge on mind  pleads gabriel to train her in the way of killing cyborgs and she  ll get him to gabriel .  br    br   cheap low  rent cyborg  post  apocalyptic foray by writer  director albert pyun  who made  cyborg  prior to it and the blistering  nemsis  the same year  is reasonably a misguided hunk of junk with some interesting novelties . very little structure makes its way into the threadbare story  as the turgid script is weak  corny and overstated . the leaden banter tries to be witty  but it pretty much stinks and comes across being comical in the unintentional moments . most of the occurring actions are pretty senseless and routine . the material could  ve used another polish up  as it was an inspired idea swallowed up by lazy inclusions  lack of a narrative and an almost jokey tone . the open  ended  cliffhanger conclusion is just too abrupt  especially since a sequel has yet to be made . makes it feel like that that run out of money  and said  time to pack up . let  s finish it off another day  or maybe in another decade  . there  s no rush .  however it did find it rather diverting  thanks largely to its quick pace  some well  executed combat and george mooradian  s gliding cinematography that beautifully captured the visually arresting backdrop . performances are fair . kris kristofferson  s dry and steely persona works perfectly as gabriel and a self  assured  psychically capable kathy long pulls off the stunts expertly and with aggression . however her acting is too wooden . a mugging lance henriksen gives a mouth  watering performance of pure ham  as the villainous cyborg leader job who constantly having a saliva meltdown . scott paulin also drums up plenty of gleefulness as one of the cyborgs and gary daniels pouts about as one too . pyun strikes up few exciting martial art set pieces  involving some flashy vigour and gratuitous slow  motion . seeping into the background is a scorching  but mechanical sounding music score . the special effects and make  up fx stand up fine enough . watchable  but not quite a success and it  s minimal limitations can be a cause of that .  ,0

the tenants began as a     short novel by the now deceased bernard malamud  writer  philosopher  examining the conflicts between jews and african americans in the incendiary atmosphere of brooklyn at the time the book was written . as a novel the story was gut wrenchingly real as transcribed into a screenplay by novices david diamond and danny green  who also directs  it is more of a cerebral dissertation that gradually erupts into action in the final moments .  br    br   harry lesser  dylan mcdermott  is a jewish novelist with one book under his belt but currently attempting to finish his  newest  book ten years into the writing . convinced that he must complete the novel in the same environment where it was started . he is the sole tenant in a condemned brooklyn tenement owned by levinspiel  seymour cassel  who constantly tries to  buy out  harry  s lease so that the filthy dilapidated building can be demolished . into this atmosphere enters another black militant quasi  anti  semitic writer willie spearmint  snoop dogg  whom harry befriends  hides  and offers help to the nascent novelist  s attempt to write about the death of all white people . harry  s attempts to help willie lead to conflict  not the least of which is harry  s meeting willie  s girlfriend  the white jewish irene bell  rose byrne  at a less than friendly gathering of willie  s militant black brothers and sisters . willie and irene are on the skids and harry gradually falls in love with irene and they plan to leave new york as soon as harry finishes his novel . when willie hears of the assignation and is further critiqued by harry  willie explodes and begins the downward descent of not only a delicate friendship but also a competition between writers . the ending  reveals the slippery nature of the human condition  and the human capacity for violence and undoing  .  br    br   the actors do their best with a script that is a bit awkward but despite scripted lines that border on preaching they create believable characters . the cinematography enhances the story  keeping the mood dank and dense and primarily confined to the condemned building . the musical score appropriately makes use of the solo jazz trumpet and blues piano to underline the tension and isolation of each of these groundless characters . though it takes some patience to make it through the cerebral ramblings  the film in the end is worth watching . at least it attempts to recreate malamud  s bizarre look at life in the big city . grady harp  ,1
i think micheal ironsides acting career must be over  if he has to star in this sort of low budge crap . surely he could do better than waste his time in this rubbish .  br    br   this movie could be far better  if it had a good budget  but it shows repeatedly through  out the movie . there is one scene at a outpost  which looks like  its outside the front of a railway station  and i bet it was .  br    br   there is one scene which made give this movie a   and it shows the space craft landing and taking off over a lake  surrounded by forests . this was well done  but the rest of the movie  forget it .  br    br   there is another scene  which looks like a engineering plant  which i bet it  and does not look like a space outpost as the character say it is .  br    br   this movie is stupid  has a serious low budget  makes no sense and god help micheal ironsides .  ,0

this is a truly awful  b  movie . it is witless and often embarrassing . the plot  the basic  making into show business  routine  is almost nonexistent . in fact  the film is merely an excuse to push the war effort and highlight some popular music groups of      including the mills brothers  count basie  duke ellington  bob crosby  and freddy slack . each group gets about the standard three minutes  the exception being the mills brothers  who for some reason warranted two numbers . ann miller doesn  t get to dance until the last couple of minutes of the film  and she has little to do but strut her stuff amid a barrage of patriotic propaganda .  br    br   the most interesting moment in the film  in my view  occurred in the duke ellington segment . the band appears to be playing in a train  standing in awkward positions .  in the deep south at the time  the band was segregated in railroad cars when traveling .  johnny hodges is seen next to duke  and harry carney may also be identified . in the last moments of the film  trumpeter  violinist ray nance rushes down the aisle to the camera and does an  uncle tom   bugging his eyes and wiggling his head the way willy best did in many films . for modern viewers  especially jazz fans  this homage to segregation is sad indeed . some movies go best unseen .  ,0
i haven  t watched the movie yet  but can  t wait to see it  it seems very interesting and inspirational . it was one of the most interesting trailers i  ve ever seen the questions it posed really stopped me and made me think  the unique approach to the sport of boxing as a metaphor for the  battle within  . . . thank god somebody is hitting another angle with the boxing thing . this film looks so fresh and smart . and the actor is really hot . i especially enjoyed the short clip with the actor from the rocky movies  really clever . i thought that the topic selected  overcoming adversities and childhood traumas  is timeless  and god knows a lot of people need it . bring it on .  ,1

can i be as simple and primitive in my evaluations as to simply say  i liked it   it  s reasonably funny by bits  it got great stars and it  s gorgeous to look at . the songs  there are about two which are then repeated  are forgettable  but they get a healthy ironic treatment  such as the terribly handsome mr fairbanks exploding into frenzied wagnerian version of the tender ballad miss grable has just rendered   there isn  t much dancing with all the     crinolines draped around miss grable  and the comedy might be a bit heavy handed  but the result still is very uplifting . the photography  including real outdoor shots which are a thrill  is amazing  playing around with different shades of lush heavy gold . miss grable is a bit past her prime and on the plumpish side  but still fresh and comfortable in this continental  olde worlde  comedy . it  s pretty much along the line of  down to earth  with rita hayworth  and that one tends to be rather disliked by many . so i suppose several people would deem  that lady in ermine  to be outdated and stuffy . but it  s a fairy tale  and these tend to move along at a certain paste anyhow . my suggestion is  just enjoy the artwork  the costumes  the witty script and everything else this film has to offer  and stop complaining . the film has been released on dvd in germany  with both german and english soundtrack .  ,1

this picture seemed way to slanted  it  s almost as bad as the drum beating of the right wing kooks who say everything is rosy in iraq . it paints a picture so unredeemable that i can  t help but wonder about it  s legitimacy and bias . also it seemed to meander from being about the murderous carnage of our troops to the lack of health care in the states for ptsd . to me the subject matter seemed confused  it only cared about portraying the military in a bad light  as a  an organzation that uses mind control to turn ordinary peace loving civilians into baby killers and b  an organization that once having used and spent the bodies of it  s soldiers then discards them to the despotic bureacracy of the v . a . this is a legitimate argument  but felt off topic for me  almost like a movie in and of itself . i felt that  the war tapes  and  blood of my brother  were much more fair and let the viewer draw some conclusions of their own rather than be beaten over the head with the film makers viewpoint . f   ,0
the best that i can say about this film is that it was mildly amusing at times  and that it was an adequate time killer . unfortunately  this film is also so annoying that i wanted to slap these characters around . this is the kind of film that is so sweet  it hurts your teeth . the intentions were good  i suppose  but things get awfully tiresome when the dialogue is so nauseating . when the two leads aren  t together on  screen  this really isn  t bad at all  but be afraid during those frequent moments when the loving couple starts talking to one another .  ,0
there was no characterization in this movie and really shows how much this talentless hack who directed this needs to learn his craft . all his characters in this movie were so unlikable and i could care less . the best point in this movie was the end credits and the hour long shower after this cause i felt so damn dirty that i wasted money on this stinking load . hey genius . . . . triads and yakuza are from two different places learn something about asian culture . the dog scene in this felt so tacked on and useless . this dvd does prove useful i do love my new coaster .  br    br   so kids don  t waste your cash on this crap buy hostel instead .  ,0

lindsay anderson was very much a european film maker  whereas the likes of david lean  ridley scott and alan parker make spectacular movies involving visuel scope andersons movie are more about social commentary and subtext  so much so that the message often ends up taking over the entire film whose primary function should be to entertain the audience  br    br   what you think of if comes down to what you think of british film makers . im very much of the view that cinema should be a universial medium  the best brit movie makes are those who try to emulate hollywood in my opinion   if you want to send a message try pony express  and i find the movie dated  pretentious and too set in the     s .     was the summer of love and the year of student rebellion in france . you can just imagine every single french leftist worshipping this movie especially the climax . french new wave film makers will also admire the abstract surrealism of some scenes but a mainstream international will dislike it  and many will dislike it intensely  ,0
i myself am a big fan of low  budget    s horror films . this isn  t the worst but still not to spectacular . the plot line is decent but drags out way too long . you  re through half the movie before you even get to see any zombie action . the kills aren  t very creative and the zombies aren  t too crafty . i truly think this movie would have been better if they left out the zombies and just made it into some mafia flick . it  s watchable but i feel that this film did steal at least an hour of my life . i  ll give the film credit for being somewhat original . if you are really into b horror movies it  s worth a viewing but if you  re not  don  t bother . but you don  t have to take my word for it .  ,0
i just watched the incredible melting man for the second time  and it was even more boring than when i first watched it . i don  t understand why it has become such a  cult classic  when it is so tediously dull . the opening scene looks promising  when the fat nurse drops the canister of blood and runs for her dear life . after this all that really happens is the melting man stalks around some woods and houses  whilst having flashbacks of his life as an astronaut . the makeup is quite good  and his melting gooey face looks fairly realistic . there is a cool scene where he throws a mans head in a river  and it floats until it reaches a waterfall where it falls on rocks and bursts open . there  s not much to wet yourself over though  most scenes are shot in darkness and you can  t really see what is happening . there isn  t much gore  at least in the vipco dvd i watched .  br    br   no  the incredible melting man is not that great at all . i  ll give it marks for its cheese factor but that  s about it . if you want a true sci  fi  horror cult classic  watch the deadly spawn instead   ,0
definitely  definitely the worst film i  ve ever seen  no questions asked  contradictors of this opinion might argue that this title should not be judged by the same criteria as others  since it  s an independent  low  budget film  but c  mon already  the amateurism and meager innovation is horrifying .  br    br   agreeing with everything that has been said about this film  for example the mind numbingly weak acting  when it  s this bad you take another go at shooting the scene  god damn it   the thing i found the most annoying was the total lack of common sense in the script  assuming such a thing existed during the production . there was an obvious absence of a dialogue with respect for the viewers  the girls switched personalities several times and they seemed to show absolutely no sing of any rationality or even brains  five relatively fit girls against one slight female psychopath  gang up on her  why don  t you   br    br   the only thing that can be regarded as somewhat of a conquest for this title is the camera not leaving the van at any time thus the viewer seeing everything from inside it  which is  as the rest of the film  a good idea executed exponentially dreadfully .  br    br   oh and by the way  this movie is nothing like the blair witch project or cloverfield or any other title filmed with a hand  held camera  this is an effect and not a trait  used cleverly it can be breathtaking  but in this case it  s an excuse for inadequate cinematography .  ,0
i accidently felt on this movie on tv  and i wasn  t able to leave it . . . . it  s really an excellent movie which makes people learning about american  s history with the vietnam war  the flower power  s time  the racism  s fight . . . . it illustrates the conflict of generation  of political opinion  of race which took place in the    s . . . . i  m born in     so i didn  t know all that stuff before . . . in france  usa  s history is not a priority and that movie really learned me a lot of facts  by the way  i think all the actors are great especially jordana brewster  josh hamilton and jerry o  connell . now i can see this film more then  time each day   it  s really great . . . . what a shame it only appeared on tv not in cinemas . . .  br    br    ,1
basically  a dentist husband  wife team and their  daughters deal with infidelity . the premise is interesting  the acting is good  and the music  although sometimes abrupt and without direction  is pretty cool .  br    br   the problem is the plot . the husband dentist drops his wife off backstage at an opera before the show  she has a minor role  and then walks back in to give her something  but sees her with another man . the rest of the movie deals with his angst about this episode  his visual hallucinations and a macho alter  ego  denis leary  a former patient of his  and his fear in confronting his wife lest he will have to  do something about it .  i won  t tell you the ending  but let me say that the film goes nowhere and the ending is like a sputtering whimper . the motivations of the characters are missing why is she cheating on him  he  s a dentist  decent looking  good father . the film doesn  t say . who  s she doing it with  don  t expect any answers on that either . why does he want to keep the marriage going in spite of all this  who knows . what purpose does all the kids vomiting serve  where is this film going  good performances by campbell scott and hope davis  and denis leary as comic relief  are completely wasted by this stilted nonsense which doesn  t know if it wants to be american beauty or a family film . a root canal is more interesting . avoid it .  ,0
i really like    dalmations when it came out in      now  years later i went to see    dalmations in      i thought it was fantastic but i think    is better because i think it  s more funnier  more humor  and also that movie was based on the same story as the cartoon version  one hundred and one dalmations       i wonder if there are plans for    dalmations . i hope there is  maybe yes  maybe no  all of us dalmation fans will have to find out if there is going to be    dalmations in the future .  ,1
this movie was exactly what i expected  not great  but also not that bad either . in my opinion pg   movies aren  t scary enough so that  s why i already knew i was going to be bored throughout the entire film . sure there were scary things going on in the hotel room  but nothing we all haven  t already seen . i guess i didn  t like it because i thought there were too many twists and turns happening it got old and repetitive . i also didn  t understand if all the things cusack was experiencing in the room was real or not . there is no explanation for any of the events that occurred . the movie just drags on and when it finally does come to an end you want it to keep going because you are still waiting around for someone to tell you what the whole movie was about . what i did like was the special effects . other than that there wasn  t much enjoyment from it . maybe its just me but i thought this was below average .  ,0
this movie looked like a classic in the cheesy   s slasher genre  which is my favorite genre of them all  so when i saw it was free on demand  i had to watch it  it stars caroline munro  from both dr . phibes films  she was his wife that died    dracula a . d .      the golden voyage of sinbad  captain kronos  vampire hunter  the spy who loved me  maniac  and faceless .  br    br   brought to you by the people behind don  t open til christmas and pieces  heres my thoughts on this . . .  br    br   it opens on april fools day  where a bunch of kids play an elaborate prank on the school nerd  promising him sex in the shower  and giving him public humiliation and a face in the toilet  all while hes naked   . the coach puts a stop to it  but both parties swear revenge . but  the cool kids end up burning the nerd alive .  br    br   cut to the future  and its th high school reunion  or so they think  bwahahha   . the only ones with invitations were the gang who burned the kid  and its april fools day  or really  the day before april fools  but the fun starts at midnight   yet they fail to see the coincidence and hang out in front of the school until nightfall . then they finally break into the school and it starts storming .  br    br   inside they find food  drink and a little shrine for each of them  each of their lockers and belongings  along with marty  s  the nerds  locker and yearbook . they also find the old black janitor  caretaker who spends his time saying  oooh yesser  yesser  i don  t want no trouble  sir   and then is killed instantly . pretty pointless character  but hes still my favorite .  br    br   the movie takes a page out of alien  s book  in a deliciously gory way that you just have to see  thats when everyone realizes that they  re there to die  and they start freaking out  except for shirley  who decides it would be best to take a bath in the old school showers at a time like this . of course  it pours out blood and acid and her face melts off  very cool  mind you  the rest of the night goes as usual  sex  drugs  and marty killing everyone whilst wearing a jester mask . . whats their plan   all we have to do is stay awake and wait till noon . marty wont kill us during mid  day   . seriously  thats what he said . apparently you can only kill at nighttime . but will they survive through the night  who will live and who will die  and why are all the bodies disappearing  rent  buy  or steal this great movie to find out  the movie is actually very good  filled with clichs  car wont start  dammit   and just plain slasher fun . not to mention they all have names like carol and nany and frank and joe and susan . i recommend it to all of you  and  not to mention  it has a spin off       s cutting class is a spin  off from this slasher gem  and that movie starts the career of brad pitt and roddy mcdowell .  br    br   favorite scene  people having sex  the guy wants to finish but the girl doesn  t .  talk dirty to me  frank    she screams  uh . . . tits    dirtier    uh . . . tits . fck . tits . boobs . fck .  . it seems to work for her and at her climax  the killer electrocutes them both   ,1
i got this one a few weeks ago and love it  it  s modern  light but filled with true complexities of life . it questions and answers  just like other eytan fox movies . this is my favorite  along with jossi  jagger . this pictures a lot more  universally  than only the bubbles we may live in . you don  t need to be jewish or homosexual to enjoy this  i  m not  but the movie goes directly to my top ten movies . at first it seems like pure entertainment but it does make you think further . relationships we have to live with are superficial  meaningful  deep  fatal  you name it . you don  t know what  s coming  and you definitely don  t know where this story is heading as you watch it the first time . it is worth seeing several times . fox movies include great bonus material  here a great music video and  the making of   including explanation of the title  interviewing lior ashknenazi who plays himself in the movie and arabs with doubts about the israeli life styles  .  ,1
the prophecy ii  what  s there to say about it  they  ve completely abandoned the originality of the first film  and simply made a chris walken splatter film . it  s not even written by the original writer   br    br   if you  ve seen nr .  don  t watch nr .  it  s a real disappointment . . .  br    br   if you haven  t seen nr .  don  t watch nr .   go see nr .  to experience something original and fun  ,0
if you need cheering up on a cold weekday evening  this is the film for you  excellent script and perfectly cast actors . i especially loved ray psyching himself up in front of the mirror before gigs  inspired   ,1
this is hands down the greatest stand up show ever . i  ve seen a lot of stand up shows  been to a lot of stand up shows  and watch bet  s comic view  but i have never seen anyone who could match the skills of murphy on this show . the impressions are excellent  the skits are great  and the timing is perfect . you can even tell the crowd gets really into . when he did raw a few years later it was also really good  but this is   in my book . also shows that at one time  particularly the early  to mid eighties  that murphy was funny . my favorite parts of the show is when he is retelling the family barbecue and  ice cream    mooommmm   the ice cream man is coming      another great part is where his mom is like clint eastwood .  ,1
wimpy stuffed shirt armand louque  blandly played by veteran character actor dean jagger in a rare lead role  joins a group of researchers who want to find and destroy the secret technique of creating zombies . armand falls for the lovely claire duval  fetching blonde dorothy stone   who uses the meek sap to get armand  s colleague clifford grayson  the hopelessly wooden robert noland  to marry her . furious over being used and spurned by claire  armand uses his knowledge of voodoo to get revenge . sound exciting  well  it sure ain  t . for starters  victor halperin  s static  non  direction lets the meandering and uneventful talk  ridden story plod along at an excruciatingly slow pace . worse yet  halperin crucially fails to bring any tension  atmosphere and momentum to the hideously tedious proceedings . the mostly blah acting from a largely insipid cast doesn  t help matters any only george cleveland as the hearty general duval and e . alyn warren as the irascible dr . trevissant manage to enliven things a bit with their welcome and refreshing hammy histrionics . the drippy stock film library score  the painfully obvious stagebound sets  and the crude cinematography are pretty lousy and unimpressive as well . in fact  this feeble excuse for a fright feature is so crummy that not even the uncredited starkly staring eyes of the great bela lugosi can alleviate the brain  numbing boredom . a dismally dull dud .  ,0
this docu  drama is what you would expect from richard attenborough  the man who gave us  gandhi   beautifully photographed  compellingly casted  well written in the measured  literate manner that hollywood discarded in the    s  and scrupulously accurate . it stands out as a genre film  excelling in its portrayal of native american  or  more appropriately for its canadian setting   first nations   culture and standing with  black robe  as a wonderfully photographed piece of canoe country and its culture  here  circa      . this idyllic portrait derives drama from its subject archie  grey owl  belaney  a scot raised in hastings  england  by maiden aunts who became so obsessed with the  red indian  tales of his childhood that he went to canada  disappeared into the woods  and became a trapper and adopted son of an ojibway band . he was a vain man with a habit of marrying and abandoning  br    br   indian brides  none of whom seem to have thought less of him for it  for he was also an extraordinarily charming and picaresque character . one of his wives  one smarter than he  by most accounts  propelled him into fame as a writer and early advocate for protecting the wild country of the north  and this forms the focus of attenborough  s tale . the chemistry between brosnan and annie galipeau  as grey owl  s wife pony  is engaging and  if not firey  is nonetheless quite touching . a good film when you need some time from the madding crowd .  ,1
oh my . i decided to go out to the cinemas with some friends  wanting to watch one of those mild  feel  good christmas movies  and i walk out disgusted . the movie failed . full  stop . paul giamatti who i consider as a good actor played his character and roll just horribly  along with vince vaughn who has always been a personal favourite of mine . they try and turn a christmas movie  into some new  style . sort of bad  mixed with good  but it all turned out very wrong . the first ten or so minutes weren  t too bad  but once we saw santa  it was over . it didn  t get any better  the rate stayed the same  there was no character development  and certainly is one of the worst christmas movies ever invented . don  t watch it  whatever you do .  ,0
this guy has no idea of cinema . okay  it seems he made a few interestig theater shows in his youth  and about two acceptable movies that had success more of political reasons cause they tricked the communist censorship . this all is very good  but look carefully he does not know his job  the scenes are unbalanced  without proper start and and  with a disordered content and full of emptiness . he has nothing to say about the subject  so he over  licitates with violence  nakedness and gutter language . how is it possible to keep alive such a rotten corpse who never understood anything of cinematographic profession and art  why don  t they let him succumb in piece   ,0
i just recently watched this on the sundance channel . the idea for the film was to bring many filmmakers  illustrious in their own country  to make short films  eleven of them  all in one film  concentrating on just one subject september   .  br    br   from wacthing this movie i could tell why these filmmakers were great in their country because it had all elements of a great film .  br    br   the movie starts off with a film from iran in which a teacher struggles to teach the students about what had happened with september   which they fail to realize until later .  br    br   the second film from france involves a deaf women who writes a letter to her lover angrily while she is unaware of what is going as the t . v plays .  br    br   the next film from egypt involves the filmmaker himself talking with a dead soldier about recent events not only about terrorists of     but bombings in other places .  br    br   the next comes from bolivia in which a girl learns about the events of september   and believes they must march for them .  br    br   the next from a country in africa in which a group of boys follow a man whom they believe to be bin ladin .  br    br   the next comes from mexico in which nothing is shown but the sounds of that day .  br    br   the next from israel involving a reporter at the scene of a bomb trying to get a report but is frequently told about the attacks .  br    br   there are other films that i can  t remember at the moment but all of them are powerful . it will bring back your emotions from that day .  br    br         ,1
i purchased this film for   in a bargain bin at my local video store for one reason only  chase masterson  but i should have crumbled up the five  thrown it in a toilet and flushed . the film is about a bunch of twenty somethings that peaked in high school and reunite on the anniversary of their idiot friends death  who got drunk and wandered into the woods and died . there problem is a reptilian monster is hunting them down one by one . the acting is abysmal  these worthless people were apparently cast offs on shows like      and dawsons creek . the directing was on par with a twelve year old and the script was probably done by a thirteen year old . the entire set looks like someone  s backyard in malibu . the people on here that have praised this film are obviously friends of the director and  or actors . avoid this pile of garbage at all costs .  ,0
yes  the plot is hardly plausible and very thin . yes  the acting does range from average to laughable . yes  it has been done so many times before . however what we are dealing with is a film that does not shy away from these facts and pretends to be nothing more than it is . there are indeed some original death scenes and the tension does increase throughout the movie . in addition you are never more than a few minutes away from a gory killing . i urge everyone to watch this film with an unprejudiced eye and see it for what it set out to be a scary  funny slasher flick with a theme tune second to none .  ,1
four eyed monsters follows the relationship of a shy  reclusive videographer and an equally estranged struggling artist  who  both living in the big apple  develop an unlikely romance with the help of an internet dating site . this in itself is not so unusual  but what is  is their method of communication . foregoing the verbal  they take to writing notes and later communicating through video .  br    br   the film is based upon the creator  s  arin crumley  susan buice  own relationship  who besides writing and directing  take to acting as the lead characters as well . with elements of avant  garde  anti  plot  and docudrama  the film scatters itself to the wind with an undecided structure nestled neatly between narcissism and self  indulgence .  br    br   as the movie wears on  a brief separation and deterioration of their once intriguing form of communication grow old as the couple face the hardship of reality . focusing solely on inner conflict  or the woes of relationship  the film struggles through a stagnant narrative that is neither original  nor poignant . this could have been easily circumvented with the addition of subplot and external conflict  and a third act  to which there is none  just a montage of melodrama that leads nowhere .  br    br   what is even more aggravating is the film  s descent from story into reality that abruptly concludes with an open ended and unsatisfying finish . this would have been all fine and dandy  but there is no question asked and no meaning to be discovered or pondered .  br    br    on a side note  the film contains beautiful animation and a vivid and moving soundtrack  one of the more interesting aspects of the production .   br    br   but as always  watch the film and decide for yourself .  ,0
in      charlie chaplin began making pictures . these were made for mack sennett  also known as  keystone studios   and were literally churned out in very rapid succession . the short comedies had very little structure and were completely ad libbed . as a result  the films  though popular in their day  were just awful by today  s standards . many of them bear a strong similarity to home movies featuring obnoxious relatives mugging for the camera . many others show the characters wander in front of the camera and do pretty much nothing . and  regardless of the outcome  keystone sent them straight to theaters . my assumption is that all movies at this time must have been pretty bad  as the keystone films with chaplin were very successful .  br    br   the charlie chaplin we know and love today only began to evolve later in chaplin  s career with keystone . by      he signed a new lucrative contract with essenay studios and the films improved dramatically with chaplin as director . however  at times these films were still very rough and not especially memorable . no  chaplin as the cute little tramp was still evolving . in      when he switched to mutual studios  his films once again improved and he became the more recognizable nice guy   in many of the previous films he was just a jerk  either getting drunk a lot  beating up women  provoking fights with innocent people  etc .  . the final evolution of his little tramp to classic status occurred in the     s as a result of his full  length films .  br    br   it  s interesting that this film is called twenty minutes of love since the film only lasts about   minutes  oh well . the plot  what little there is  involves the little tramp in the park . a couple wants to neck but inexplicably  charlie insists on practically sitting on the couple  s lap and really annoying them . i can  t understand why and the short consists of charlie wandering about the park annoying these people and some others later in the film . perhaps he was looking for a threesome  i don  t know . but the film lacks coherence and just isn  t particularly funny   even when people start slapping each other and pushing each other in the lake . a typical poor effort before chaplin began to give his character a plot and personality .  ,0
i saw this at the premiere in melbourne  br    br   it is shallow  two  dimensional  unaffecting and  hard to believe given the subject matter  boring . the actors are passable  but they didn  t have much to work with given the very plodding and unimpressive script . for those who might have worried that ned kelly would be over  intellectualised  you can take comfort in the fact that this telling of the story is utterly without any literary depth at all  told entirely on the surface and full of central casting standards . however  it doesn  t work as a popcorn film either . its pacing is too off  kilter and its craft is too lacking to satisfy even on the level of a mundane actioner .  br    br   i very much doubt gregor jordan could sit back and say to himself  this is the best i could have done with the material  .  br    br   ned kelly is a fascinating figure  and equally so is the national response to him . possibly folk genius  possibly class warrior  possibly psychopath and probably all these things  he has dominated australian true mythology for over    years . once again  his story has failed miserably on the big screen .  br    br   such is life .  ,0
this is just the best movie of all times  sorry  hollywood  i  ve seen it in early    s  as soon as it appeared on the bulgarian tv  and i loved it immediately  i was   then  .   years later i bought it on a video tape  and a few months ago it finally appeared on a dvd here in bulgaria . i live with this movie   years already  and so do all my friends and my family . my son was a teenager when he saw it for the first time  and he loved it immediately  too  and this is the generation that grew up watching practically only hollywood movies and not speaking or understanding russian at all   . what makes this masterpiece of danelia so special  it  s difficult to say  as it is difficult to describe what the beauty is . . . but the fact is that you can watch this movie dozens of times with the same pleasure as it was the first time . i can  t remember any other such movie  no matter how many millions it cost or how great the cast was . . . chapeau  maestro danelia  bulgaria loves you   ,1
i just saw hot millions on tcm and i had completely forgotten this gem . ustinov creates a clever and divisive plot that has him cleverly going from two bit con man to ingenious . . . well you  ll see . maggie smith is perfect as the bumbling secretary  neighbor who has a tough time holding a job but has a warm and vibrant personality that beams through in this picture . she creates a fine portrayal of a warm  witty and real person who in the long run . . . well . . .  br    br   molden and newhart as top executives take on the challenge of making what could be banal roles and make them come out into a comic life of their own .  br    br   robert morley and ceasar romero are just a pleasure to see and i know at least in romero  s case ustinov is extending a helping hand of work .  br    br   this film is meant to be a shot back at the rising computer age and it  s problems for the average con man or man for that matter but in fact the characters are so involving and so much fun to watch that the computer sub plot is almost lost . . . i say almost .  br    br   let down your usual expectations of modern comedy and look for the great performances and friendly  forgiving and deeply involving plot in this picture .  ,1
i first saw this film when i was about seven years old and was completely enchanted by it then but for years was unable to find out what the film was called . now i am twenty one and stumbled upon the film by accident about two weeks ago and bought a copy . although my memory of the film was a little hazy i was in no way disappointed by what i saw . the animation in this film is superb conjuring up an entire world that is so believable and so well animated that you are drawn in to the film by that alone . but this film also has a plot that will enchant and entertain adults and children alike . with a floating island  a mad general  a friendly pirate granny and a well constructed love story this film will not let you down i would recommend this film to any one .  ,1
if you have ever read and enjoyed a novel by tom robbins you will appreciate this movie as a whole  hearted attempt to translate his outrageously unconventional writing style into a workable piece of big screen art . the actors and the direction of this film are both good .  br    br   the only trouble with the film  as i can see it  is that robbins can relate ideas and sentiments with his words that were still beyond hollywood  s capabilities at the time this film was shot .  br    br   given both the irreverence of today  s movies  as well as the willingness and abilityof today  s audiences to delve into the bizarre  i think  even cowgirls . . . would receive a better reception today than it did when it was originally released .  ,1
thanks to a dull  dimensionless screenplay by neil simon  and lackluster direction from robert moore  chapter two becomes a shrill showcase for marsha mason who received her third of four oscar nods for chapter two giving the same performance here that she gave in cinnderella liberty      the goodbye girl      audrey rose     and only when i laugh     only this time she doesn  t have a child to drag around . chapter two is the third and last feature film for moore having previously directed neil simon  s the cheap detective     and murder by death     . caan is miscast  the characters are mono  dimensional  the dialog is overly analytical  and there  s virtually no establishing detail . the first half is a less  than  captivating  meet cute  coy romance between a blinkered caan and a chipper mason  and the dreary second half makes you long for the first half . the nyc locations as well as joe bologna  and a painfully thin valerie harper are irrelevant  but at least they provide some welcome distraction . and last and least  there  s an awful song played during the credits .  ,0

i was a little skepticle if i should watch this when it was first shown on cbs . i was one of the many people who were in nyc on that day  i was going to school at hunter college . i didnt want to see all the devistation and carnage again  but like many i was curious to see what this was all about . tears came to my eyes watching this documentary . all my memories returned and just the intense images were unbelievable . i bought the dvd on the one year anniversary and watched it a few times . how these guys were able to capture this footage was incredible . if you have not seen this documentary  do yourself a favor and check it out . it is obviously depressing and will bring tears to eyes  but it  s an incredible document of this countries darkest hour .  ,1
the film attempts to be a mockumentary   shot in the documentary form but with many obviously scripted parts   but fails in not providing the audience with any characters with which to create the illusion of the mockumentary . also  the film purports to be about finding real love in los angeles  but is nothing more than an uninteresting look at an amateur filmmaker trying to make his first  big movie .   ,0
i have seen most  if not all of the laurel  hardy classic films . i have always enjoyed there comical stupidly  even after watching it over and over again . this new film attempts to bring back the classic with two new actors who resemble both laurel  hardy  however fails miserably for various reasons . one of which is how out of place their cloths are  still early   th century  however are both portrayed in the    s setting . some of the former dialogue was brought back  however it also fails miserably to come close to the classic series . this film could very well be the worst film i have ever seen and should be pulled off the shelf and locked away forever . the real laurel  hardy are surly spinning in their graves at such a bad imitation .  ,0
robert de niro  cuba gooding jr .  hal holbrook  and all the rest of the actors and actresses in  men of honour  have combined to make this a fine movie . mark isham wrote the filmscore  so you know the music is truly fine  too .  br    br   but after noticing a slew of goofs  loopholes  and over  dramatic heart  string pluckings right from the start  i had to make a vow to ignore them and sit back to enjoy the film . if you can do that  it  really  is  good .  br    br   the story of carl brashear  a true  to  life hero  is inspirational enough to last a lifetime . look him up on the internet . . . the entire story is more amazing than the film  as the director admitted in his comments . there were only three african  american u . s . navy divers in world war ii . however  none reached the status of u . s . navy master diver . carl brashear was the first african  american u . s . navy master diver . and he was the first amputee diver to ever be certified or recertified as a u . s . navy diver .  resounding applause  .  br    br   on the negative side of the movie  s ledger should i tell you of only one of the many  loopholes   yeah  i  ll mark this comment as containing  spoilers  and do so . . . the early  pivotal scene where the helicopter hits the radio mast and sinks into the sea they  d never have had the time to suit up a full mark v diver  even if he were the legendary master chief billy sunday  in time to be only  . . . a couple of minutes late  saving the pilot .  br    br   so  for loopholes  goofs  and over  dramatization  i derated  men of honor  from a perfect   down to a  .  br    br   will hollywood ever realize that the unalloyed truth is so much better that their over  dramatic approach to story  telling  i doubt it . too bad   ,1
the often  reliable leonard maltin says this is a  delightful romance  and that sanders is  superb .  maltin must have confused this movie with something else . sanders is snide and droll and superb  as usual   you can imagine his delivery of the line regarding adultery   sometimes the chains of matrimony are so heavy they have to be carried by three   but dull  wooden and dated describe this movie more accurately . the storyline itself  an autobiography with sanders as a suave jewel thief  francois eugene vidocq  who becomes chief of police but can hardly resist the lure of fine jewels  is entertaining enough  but it has the same kind of hollow historical hollywood treatment that marred such period epics as marie antoinette  and certainly the deplorable forever amber  which screams for a classy remake  . though  in his defense  sanders tries mightily to add some depth to his character  it is all for naught . i am an unabashed douglas sirk fan  but this is      and it is one of sirk  s earliest american efforts  lacking many of the signature touches that would define his florid  breast  heaving potboilers . sirk is just getting his feet wet here  and made a number of unmemorable films over the next ten years until he struck gold with magnificent obsession  and hit his stride  bombarding us with such estrogen  fests as all that heaven allows  written on the wind  and imitation of life . but scandal in paris is hardly his best work  a relatively low  budget affair with cheesy sets and ineffective costuming .  ,0
let me start off by saying that this doesn  t seem or feel like a movie . it seems like just another tv show about popular girls and boys with no real film language top back it up .  br    br   the camera angles are so straight forward that the story is told the simplest way possible never making the public connect with it . this film takes us to where no movie i  ve seen has done before to a realm where the film theater becomes a warm medium giving the public every element of interpretation . too obvious . the large movie screen is only used as an enlarged tv from where we can see every attribute of these women in a larger than life manner .  br    br   lately it seems that young directors are compromising the art of film making for sales . this is very scary . the industry is spoiling the art in movies . we must educate ourselves and our children about what cinematography and its language are really about . not just sales and entertainment  but a way to communicate feelings  passions and even culture . not as a launching platform for young divas and jocks .  ,0
the sopranos is perhaps the most mind  opening series you could possibly ever want to watch . it  s smart  it  s quirky  it  s funny  and it carries the mafia genre so well that most people can  t resist watching . the best aspect of this show is the overwhelming realism of the characters  set in the subterranean world of the new york crime families . for most of the time  you really don  t know whether the wise guys will stab someone in the back  or buy them lunch .  br    br   further adding to the realistic approach of the characters in this show is the depth of their personalities  these are dangerous men  most of them murderers  but by god if you don  t love them too . i  ve laughed at their wisecracks  been torn when they  ve made err in judgement  and felt scared at the sheer ruthlessness of a serious criminal .  br    br   the suburban setting of new jersey is absolutely perfect for this show  s subtext  people aren  t always as they seem  and the stark contrast between humdrum and the actions taken by these seemingly petty criminals weigh up to even the odds .  br    br   if you haven  t already  you most definitely should .  ,1
i  ve waited to see this movie for a long time and at last i could manage to see it in istanbul film festival . maybe because i expected too much from this film and that  s why i was slightly disappointed . i was not the best movie from korea but still it is really worth watching .  br    br   the subject was nice and the film makes you keep watching without getting bored though it is long . but there are gaps in the movie and you jump from one point to another . however  the acting of jeon do  yeon is incredibly beautiful . it was was one of the best performances in the early cinema history and i think this movie wouldn  t be that nice if she was not in the leading role .  ,1
words can  t describe how bad this movie is . i can  t explain it by writing only . you have too see it for yourself to get at grip of how horrible a movie really can be . not that i recommend you to do that . there are so many clichs  mistakes  and all other negative things you can imagine  here that will just make you cry . to start with the technical first  there are a lot of mistakes regarding the airplane . i won  t list them here  but just mention the coloring of the plane . they didn  t even manage to show an airliner in the colors of a fictional airline  but instead used a    painted in the original boeing livery . very bad . the plot is stupid and has been done many times before  only much  much better . there are so many ridiculous moments here that i lost count of it really early . also  i was on the bad guys  side all the time in the movie  because the good guys were so stupid .  executive decision  should without a doubt be you  re choice over this one  even the  turbulence   movies are better . in fact  every other movie in the world is better than this one .  ,0
this collection of eleven short stories in one movie is a great idea  and presents some great segments  but also some disappointing surprises . based on the tragic event of the september   th     in the united states of america  eleven directors were invited to give their approach to the american tragedy . the result of most of them is not only an individual sympathy to the american people  but mainly to the intolerance in the world with different cultures and people .  br    br   ken loach  uk  presents the best segment  about the september   th     in chile  when the democratic government of salvador alliende was destroyed by the dictator augusto pinochet with the support of the usa .  br    br   the other excellent segments are the one of youssef chahine  egypt   showing the intolerance in the world  and the number of victims made by usa governments in different countries along the contemporary history and the one of mira nair  india   showing a true story of injustice and prejudice against a pakistanis family  whose son was wrongly accused of terrorism in usa  when he was indeed a hero .  br    br   some segments are beautiful samira makhmalbaf  iran  shows the innocent afghans refugee children preparing an inoffensive shelter against bombs  while their teacher tries to explain to them what happened on the other side of the world the romantic claude lelouch  france  shows the life of a couple in new york nearby the wtc danis tanovic  bosnia  herzegovina  shows the effects of their war in a small location and the lonely protest of widows sean penn is very poetic  showing that life goes on and shohei imamura  s story is probably the most impressive  showing that there is no holy war but sadness and disgrace .  br    br   the segment of idrissa quedraogo  birkina faso  is very naive  but pictures the terrible poor conditions of this african nation .  br    br   the segment of amos gital  israel  is very boring and manipulative  showing more violence and terrorism .  br    br   the segment of alejandro gonzlez irritu is very disappointing  horrible  without any inspiration and certainly the worst one .  br    br   my vote is seven .  br    br   title  brazil      de setembro    september      ,1
since the   s  writer  producer  director charles band has been responsible for literally hundreds of science  fiction  fantasy and horror b  movies . some of them are wonderful examples of how to use a tiny budget to maximum effect many of them are pretty bad . trancers       was one of those rare gems .  br    br   a terminator style tale of time  travel and action  trancers saw tim thomerson playing jack deth  a future cop given the task of tracking down bad  guy whistler  who travels into the past by inhabiting the body of an ancestor . whistler is capable of controlling other humans with his psychic powers  converting them into obedient zombies  the  trancers  of the title   and attempts to alter the course of history by killing off the ancestors of the leaders of the future . jack follows him to      determined to stop him .  br    br   in this     sequel  jack is still living in     . having destroyed whistler  he has settled down and married leena  helen hunt   the young woman who helped him succeed in the first movie . but  for jack  things don  t stay calm for long  and trouble appears in the form of whistler  s brother  e . d . wardo  who is trying to build a trancer army .  br    br   trancers ii lacks the charm and simplicity of the original and is a huge disappointment considering how good the original was . the story is difficult to pick up if you haven  t seen the first film  or at least not for a long while   and there is loads of unimpressive action and a few poor special effects . gone is the inventiveness and wit that made trancers so much fun instead we get some cheesy one  liners and a script that feels like it was written on  the  fly .  br    br   about the only reason i can give for recommending this film to fans of the genre is the cast  which boasts many names that will be familiar to followers of sci  fi and horror movies jeffrey combs  barbara crampton  richard lynch  martine beswicke . unfortunately  most of them seemed to be having an  off day  whilst filming trancers ii  and performances are mediocre at best .  br    br   the trancers series obviously has its fans four further sequels have since been churned out . unless the quality has taken up massive upward swing  i can  t imagine them being any good .  ,0
this is simply one of the finest renditions of dicken  s classic tale . the script very accurately follows the story originally penned by dickens  and captures a perfect balance between a film atmosphere and a play atmosphere . viewers fond of either format will find enough of the story rooted in their presentation style of choice .  br    br   george c . scott brings a delightfully realistic approach to the character of scrooge  and is very convincing in the character development instigated by the visits of the ghosts . i found that he was able to win me over to the point where i sympathized with the old miser  something rarely done in other versions . the superb job done by the supporting actors add greatly to this production  which is simply the most enjoyable of all the christmas carol versions i have seen .  ,1
i am still shuddering at the thought of ever seeing this movie again .  br    br   i have seen action films  i have even liked quite a few of them  but this one goes over the top .  br    br   not only does it have the worst male actor ever  sly stallone  playing the lead role  but the plot of the movie is so stupid from the beginning  why not rob the money while the plane is on the ground  would be hell of a lot easier  that it requires a person with iq less than his shoenumber to believe it .  br    br   furthermore  the plot has no real twists at all  a three year old kid could guess what comes next . it is a set of cliches  of action genre   with sly performing even worse than his other movies  he was better even in rambo iii if you watch that movie as a comedy rather than action film  . now there is an actor who can  t act a  surprised b  sad c  anything else than his basic face .  br    br   i would still like to point out that this movie has two factors that might make some people like it . explosions are outstanding  but then . . . you can see better on the  th of july . landscapes are magnificient  but then . . . there are documentaries about the alps and himalayas  so you can see better sights that way  rather than waste time on this flick .  br    br   go watch some other movie instead  there are hundreds  even thousands better action movies .  ,0
i enjoyed this movie . unlike like some of the pumped up  steroid trash that is passed off as action movies  playing god is simple and realistic  with characters that are believable  action that is not over the top and enough twists and turns to keep you interested until the end .  br    br   well directed  well acted and a good story .  ,1
argh  this film hurts my head . and not in a good way .  br    br   maybe it  s just my growing hatred for the action genre  but even as a kid when i would swallow tripe like navy seals  i still regarded this film with dislike . now i utterly despise it .  br    br   take one fairly good fast  paced story . keep the title and throw the rest away . instead use some half  assesd future gladiators storyline thats so full of plot holes the whole things in danger of collapsing  why is there a rebel base in the middle of the arena  what about the cameras  why have clearly marked footage of what really happened at bakersfeild in an unguarded room    br    br   the whole film screams eighties  from the truley awful score to the goofy shiny costumes . ugh .  br    br   don  t watch this film . i know some people liked it  but some people get off on being peed on and i don  t understand them either .  ,0
hawked as the most offensive movie ever  guaranteed to offend everyone  guess what  it worked  i  m offended that we shelled out money to rent this . two friends and i were bored and decided to see if all that bull about the movie that we saw on tv was true . curse comedy central and all the other networks that pushed this garbage on us  it was by far the worst movie i  ve seen since hollow man . i generally avoid the crappy ones  but got sucked into this one . we have since beaten the prick who suggest we rent it  and his movie picking privileges have been revoked . there is nothing remotely funny about this movie . . . even the  adventures of dickman  scene was sophomoric at best . . color me ped . thought maybe the production value was crap for some important reason . . . no . . it just sucked . never watch this  for any reason whatsoever . not even with copious amounts of illegal substance would this movie be funny . that  s saying alot . please for the love of all that is holy  if you cherish your sanity  never view this movie . it  s many things  stupid  pointless  and worthless to name a few . but the main thing it was aiming for offensively funny  it failed miserably . crash and burn . . . .  ,0
i thought this film would be a lot better then it was . it sounded like a spoof off of the spy gener  and the start of it reminded me of pleasantvil  but this film came up short .  br    br   the plot is just to ridiculous . the kgb and soviet union in russia have started up a spy school to teach their spies  how to act like americans  but the town they set up in it for training is a bit dated  so they grab two yanks from the us to spice things up . i don  t know  but this seems just to out there . it gets really odd when next to no one in this all russian town speaks in a russian accent . someone screwed up in the casting job .  br    br   also  for a comedy this is painfully dry . there is one  two funny spots tops  and they are nothing to sing and dance about . the film in the end will likely put you to sleep .  br    br   and  as a twisted punch in the face  this film is so pro the us it makes me sick . the movie keeps on saying again and again  the us is god and russia is the devil . this is the kind of smear campaign that was done against the japanese in world war  . it  s films like these that makes everyone think that the us is full of itself .  br    br   this gets a  out of    and i  m being kind . it should really get a one  but the dance scene was funny  but then again it dragged far to long to be really funny .  ,0
cracking good yarn with all the actors giving great value . michael curtiz at his best . lots of nice twists and turns and probably the best of the philo vance series . william powell looks wonderfully relaxed and at his debonair best . a forerunner to the thin man series . recommend to everyone . did you figure it all out   ,1
director kinka usher stays true to his own credo   play it straight and they will laugh   and with the help of a superb cast has crafted what should become the   cult film of all time  mystery men .  when an evil villain  casanova frankenstein  geoffrey rush  is released from a mental institution  captures the local superhero  captain amazing  greg kinnear   and threatens to take over champion city  three wanna  be superheroes  mr . furious  ben stiller   the shoveler  william h . macy  and the blue raja  hank azaria  come to the rescue . frankenstein has been joined by a myriad assortment of underworld scum  however  and has become a formidable opponent . the trio realize that help is needed  and decide to recruit what they end up with is nothing less than the most unforgettable team of superheroes  ever assembled in the history of the cinema . mr . furious has his rage the shoveler  his shovel the blue raja flings silverware  mainly forks  and the occasional spoon  but never a knife   the invisible boy  kel mitchell  can turn invisible as long as no one is watching the sphinx  wes studi   a heavy hitter from down south  is very mysterious and can break guns in half with his mind . maybe the bowler  janeane garofalo  can fling a ball with deadly accuracy and the spleen  paul reubens  wields flatulence that can incapacitate an entire room . this is a brilliant ensemble piece that delivers the laughs without ever becoming condescending or patronizing the audience  while playing it straight at all times . the dialogue is witty  and the performances given by stiller  macy  azaria and garofalo are exemplary . there is a number of memorable  hilarious scenes  especially the one in which they throw a pool party and barbecue to recruit  and conduct interviews with a stupefying assemblage of applicants and another  in a bar  when the bowler has a conversation with her long  dead father  whose skull has been implanted in her bowling ball . the funniest of all  however  has to be when the team actually attempts to rescue captain amazing . but these are only examples  for the entire movie is composed of one hilarious scene after another  laced with subtle humor that will keep you laughing and thinking about it for a long time . the real secret of it  s success  though  is that usher keeps it all real the relationships between the characters are true  and the whole concept of being a superhero  is played as being entirely reasonable  which somehow gives a sense of credibility to the entire proceedings . in this world  the aspirations of mr . furious and the rest are tenable  and usher keeps the laughs coming without ever resorting to slapstick or mere sight gags . the solid supporting cast includes lena olin  dr . annabel leek   eddie izzard  tony p .   tom waits  doc heller   claire forlani  monica   louise lasser  the blue raja  s mother   jenifer lewis  lucille  and pras  tony c .  . mystery men  is a truly inspired movie that can be seen over and over again  with a new chuckle to be had with every viewing  guaranteed . in the immortal words of the sphinx  we are number one  all others are number two  or lower .  is it an oscar  worthy movie  hardly but for a good time and a lot of laughs  treat yourself to this masterwork of comedy it  s the real deal  and you won  t regret it . i rate this one      .  ,1
this movie makes canadians and brits out to be asinine  moronic idiots . the men get stoned  drunk  and then they yell  beat each other up in almost every scene . the women are superfluous to the story  i do not understand what they are there for  they spend every scene causing a ruckus  or worse  milling around like mesmerized cattle . apparently  canadian women are either quarrelsome vulgar tramps or hulking hippie chicks . it  s the standard knocked  up girlfriend  her loser boyfriend and his wicked mother ludicrousness that we have seen in countless movies before .  br    br   every character here is a carping  infantile stereotype . not to mention that they all looked like they need a shower  and the idea of any kind of scene implying sex with george wendt  shudder  is enough to make anyone gag  i watched the movie because samuel west was in it  but i cannot understand why he would have accepted a role like this . maybe he needed the money . ian tracey is a superb actor  the only one with a vague redeeming moment  but his talent is wasted here .  br    br   as for the rest of the plot  the three imbeciles trying to get their dope back  yawn  or karl  who is dead  but who is actually a character very much alive in the minds of those left behind  almost like rebecca in alfred hitchcock  s masterpiece  although i am ashamed to even have thought to compare these two films   why even bother  karl is so galling that you find the circumstances of his death gratifying .  br    br   by the end of this wretched movie  i thought they would all have been better off going down with him on that boat   ,0
this movie must be in line for the most boring movie in years . not even woody harrison can save this movie from sinking to the bottom .  br    br   the murder in this movie are supposed to be the point of interest in this movie but is not  nothing is of any interest . the cast are not to bad but the script are just plain awful  i just sat in utter amazement during this movie  thinking how on earth can anyone find this movie entertaining  br    br   the producers of this movie were very clever . they made a boring movie but hid it well with the names of good actors and actresses on their cast . people will go to the blockbuster and probably see this movie and think  woody harrison  kristin scott thomas and willem dafoe this must be good and rent this movie .  boy are they in for a horrible time   br    br   if you like getting ripped off go and rent this movie  some people actually did enjoyed this movie but i like to watch a movie with meaning  ,0
yes  that  s right  it is . i firmly believe that the n   and the weird looking controller were both designed just so this game could be made . it was amazing the first time i saw it  with its huge environments and colorful characters  and its amazing now . the play control is perfect  the graphics are beautiful  and it has that nintendo charm that is always so intangible but undeniably there . a must have for any n   owner  and a reason to get an n   for everyone else .  ,1
awful  awful  awful .  br    br   a condescending remark at the start and a few nasty autopsy photos does not a good movie make . once again i  m amazed at the determination and skill that some people have in achieving a movie production and yet they don  t have the pride to realise that what they have made is an utter pile of crap .  br    br   i sat and tried to think of a redeeming feature so that i could at least balance my criticism but the only one i could think of was that the opening track by pink was pretty good . . . . i wonder if she has seen this   br    br   watch this at your peril  the boredom may kill you .  ,0
this movie rocks  jen sexy as ever and polly wow were we really ever that young this movie can still touch the hearts of a lot of teens it needs to be put on dvd soon or it will become a classic . i really enjoyed growing up to this movie i have always had a crush on jen now i am too old but to this movie is made for all gens  you know i come from the early    s area were i had to watch everyone els live the life i wanted but thru movies i can do that all over again i guess in short i am hoping and wishing that this movie not be lost in time but reborn to the youth so they may enjoy the heart warm filling you get learning about hormones and datting problems and how to get away with stuff that seems so major back then but don  t mean nothan now so this movie is a dating tool .  ,1
this movie is trash  poor . it has horrible taste  and is pedestrian and unconvincing in script although supposedly based on real  events  which doesn  t add much of anything but make it more of a disappointment . direction is not well done at as scenes and dialogue are out  of  place . not sure what robin williams saw in this character or story . to start  williams is not convincing as a gay in a relationship breakup nor is the relationship itself interesting . what  s worse  his character is compelled by an ugly pedophile story that is base and has no place as a plot device . you have an older rory culkin tastelessly spouting  d  ck  smker   in good fun  which is annoying enough and then laughed up by the williams character . finally you have sandra oh as a guardian angel adviser to williams and a thrown in explanation of the whole fiasco towards the end . toni collete  s character is just plain annoying and a re  hash of her  th sense performance with poorer direction . very miss  able .  ,0
i work as a hotel concierge in washington dc and take my word  there was nothing remotely accurate about the character played by michael j . fox    we simply do not walk around with our pockets bursting with theater tickets and     bills    if i ever let anybody use a room for some  afternoon delight  time i  d be fired on the spot  the organization to which i belong  les clefs d  or  has very definite standards of ethics and conduct that we take seriously .   similarly untrue was the concept  at the end of the movie  of doug simply removing his gold key emblem and passing it on to some other employee  we earn those keys and it is a badge of honor and knowledge to be allowed to wear them . there is a whole application and vetting process to joining our organization .  br    br   this film does nothing to dispel the unfortunate perception of a concierge as nothing but a money grubbing mercenary . in short it does a disservice to our organization . i welcome any comments .  ,0
this is a formula b science fiction movie  and the director made no bones about it . it is about a dragon who is restored to life by a scientific team . everything done is stuff you  ve seen many times before . it is a weak script  with no real characters . in fact  it is full of stereotype characters and situations . the director attacks this by just making it a formula movie  with no attempt to fool us  and that gives this movie a mild appeal  but it isn  t something you  re likely to remember a while . it is best seen while you  re cooking  cleaning  working out . sort of mindless fun . it has its place in entertainment  but it certainly isn  t something you sit down with friends to watch  unless you  re all just drunk and don  t care . the mass rating of  .  is probably fair . i don  t think it is as crappy as most people  but i am surprised that some people in the postings thought this was spectacular . that really eludes me  as i see no attempt to even make this a memorable film .  ,0
yikes . this is pretty bad . the play isn  t great to begin with  and the decision to transfer it to film does it no favours  especially as peploe doesn  t decide how she wants to treat the material  s theatrical origins  we get occasional glances of an observing theatre audience etc .  and has decided to go with a jumpy editing style that is intended to keep reminding you that you  re watching a film  whereas in fact it only serves to remind you that you are watching a very poor film by a director who is overwhelmed by her material . mira sorvino  s central performance is breath  takingly poor stage  y and plummy  it  s as if she  s playing the part via helena bonham  carter  s merchant ivory oeuvre . only fiona shaw delivers a performance of note  and it may be that her theatrical pedigree means that she is best able to handle the material  but it  s hard to watch a film for one performance alone  even if that performance is as light  truthful and entire as shaw  s . ben kingsley turns in an average and disengaged turn  and diana rigg  s daughter  rachel stirling plays her supporting role as just that . sadly  none of bertolucci  s magic has rubbed off on his wife if this film is to be the evidence .  ,0
i watched this movie and the original carlitos way back to back . the difference between the two is disgusting . now i know that people are going to say that the prequel was made on a small budget but that never had anything to do with a bad script . now maybe it  s just me  but i always thought that a prequel was made to go set up the other movie  starring key characters and maybe filling in a bit about life that we didn  t know . rise to power is just a movie that has carlito  s name . there should have been at least a few characters from the original movie  the ending makes no sense in relation to the original . in the end of this movie he retires with his sweet heart but how the hell do we get him coming out of prison in the next movie  and his woman isn  t even the same woman that he talks about as his only love in the original . i would say the movie is mildly entertaining in its self  with a few decent bits but it pales when held up to it  s big brother . don  t lay awake at night waiting to see this  watch the original one more time if you really need a hit .  ,0
this short film trailer is basically about superman and batman working together and forming an uneasy alliance . obviously  the two characters have vastly differing views on how to deal with crime and what constitutes punishment . it  s a lot of fun to see these two iconic characters try to get along . i won  t go int to the storyline here . but i will get into the acting  which is terrific . everyone is well cast . the two actors playing superman and batman are well suited to their characters . the same filmmakers that made batman dead end and grayson also made this short film . of the three  i probably liked this one the least  but i still thought it was well done . for me  world  s finest is a      ,1
i saw this movie at a  sneak preview  and i must honestly confess that i do not like films with meryl streep that much . this picture was the worst . half the theatre did not return after the break halfway the film . i couldnt blame them  if this wasn  t a true story there had been absolutely no need for the second half of the picture . just before the film goes forward in time about ten years i myself was expecting the credits to appear .  ,0
ok ok  it might be hard to put the entirety of a man  s life in one film . traditionally therefore  biopics focus on one or two significant parts in the subject  s life . now  byron was a  my week beats your year  fellow  which makes selecting parts that are representative even harder . furthermore  just as byron  s poetry is inseparable from his life  the man  s life itself must be seen as a whole . lifting parts out is not only not showing the whole picture  it  s showing a different picture altogether .  br    br   now  in short my review comes down to this supposedly  byron was indeed the  my week beats your year  prototype  a guy who lived so intensely that he indeed did more in his   or so active years than most do in an entire lifetime . true  he had setbacks and was a victim of the time and social setting he lived in  but in the end  this dude is supposed to be the prototype whose life we  d all want to lead  no  well  i did not  at any moment  want to live the life depicted in this film . so it gets  . not for being so badly done  which  direction  wise  it more or less was   but more importantly for missing the point entirely in a flat plot .  br    br   some more detail . well  to over simplify things  a byron bio should have two distinct episodes  . post  first europe trip england and his rise to fame  marriage   . his life abroad . now  the important thing is that the second part should be at least as important as the first . not only was it a lot longer  but the most significant change in byron took place then . furthermore  it  s where he created his best works  don juan  the vision of judgement etc .  all the stuff that makes him really unique in english literature  .  br    br   instead  in this film  a  byron  s life never comes across as even remotely entertaining   b  it only gets worse after he leaves england . they did two good jobs first  they started at his return of his europe trip  though a bit more of the actual trip would have been welcome as a prologue   second  they chose an angle  and they chose his incestuous love for augusta  who is rather perfectly cast  . the problem with this last thing is that they never let it go . true  byron remained strongly attached to augusta for the rest of his life  but  especially as he was such a mood swing person  the fact that his letters reflect that does not mean that at other times he might not have completely enjoyed life .  br    br   anyway  the first part of the tv film should have ended with him leaving england . there  s no doubt about that . the thing is once abroad  a life of debauchery began  with the infamous geneva period   but in italy byron also discovered a new life  both for his poetry  inspired by italian comedy   already in venice  and for himself when he found the contessa teresa guiccioli and moved to ravenna  afterwards  at the request of shelly  with teresa  to pisa  . in other words  he was also liberated . his mind and life opened up  and not only in the decadent sense   while england  s closed further as it fell into the gravitational pull of the victorian age . true  freedom was augusta  less  but this bitter  sweet freedom tastes sour in this film . we see a lonely  bored snob getting older .  br    br   i mean  hell  byron never thought much about his poetry  except when he finally found his own voice in don juan  apart from poetic and romantic developments  his relationship with shelly  and the down  break  should have been more documented . also  it is in italy in ravenna that he gets involved with politics and revolutionary ideas . this is important  as it shows that the decadent romantic and ultimately escapist language and person of childe harold is changing into the more planted  in  life realistic and lighter passion of the language and person of don juan . life and work are one . true  still a bit naive  but it  s what got him to greece  and the whole thing came full circle in pisa  where shelley  s revolutionary spirit further ignited the spark . missolonghi wasn  t the bored snob suddenly looking for some action . it was the insights in italy  the gambas  stirring him into action . it can be a symbol for the man looking for some ancient  style battle excitement while the rest of europe becomes fixed in the clay of modern reason and conservatism . but it wasn  t just that  there was a true inspiration behind it . meanwhile  byron wrote massive amounts of don juan . true  his end is a bit sad  but it  s not like he  s worn out . that is the essence of byron  s life he may have had some strong emotional attachments    augusta and teresa   but every time he managed to reinvent himself truly . meaning that he wasn  t  less  at the end of his life  no  he  d made a physical and mental journey that  at the time  few people were prepared to make .  br    br   i wonder . why is it that so often the second period in byron  s life is overlooked  because it had less obvious conflicts  as the man was finally coming to his own  in focusing our attention on the frustrated england years fraught with scandals  we show ourselves to be not much better than the english aristocracy at the time  which byron so despised  and which  despite the fact that he had no choice  he willingly fled in      to find a world that was modern and liberal enough to let him find the voice that would make him the first romantic plainspoken language poet and evolve from a self  obsessed snob to a passionate man moving onward with a cause .  ,0
this is bar none the most hilarious movie i have ever seen . beginning with the four delinquents being sent off by their fathers to wienberg military academy  a tone is set that steadily continues all throughout this goofball film  and it does not let up for a second .  br    br   it  s tough trying to describe this film the humor elements are so spot on and brilliantly concieved that upon a first look it appears as nothing more than a stupid    s teen lust comedy . but it is oh so much more than that  fresh from the minds of those folks over at mad magazine  up the academy serves up a formula and style that i have never since seen duplicated by any of the  funniest  offerings to come out of hollywood in years past . basically the film is so full of infantile cornball material that you might guess that the writers were a couple of   year olds themselves . see this movie if you love to act  immature .  a classic .   ,1
a trio of low  life criminals  led by matt dillon  botches a late  night burglary . they flee but quickly cross paths with the police who just happen to be in hot pursuit of a terrorist . of course the police mistake the burglar gang for the terrorist  the real terrorist gets away  and the burglars are forced to take refuge in a small dive of a bar  taking hostages  unaware why the police are so intent on catching them . and guess who else has picked the bar as a sanctuary for the night   br    br   unbelievable  absolutely . and it goes down hill from there . spacey did acquire a good bit of acting talent matt dillon  faye dunaway  gary sinise  viggo mortensen  and m . emmett walsh  but they  re all wasted . mostly because after all the characters get stuck in the bar  all they do for the remainder of the film is argue . endlessly and aimlessly . long before the conclusion of the film you  ve stopped giving a damn about what happens to them .  ,0
one of the more satisfying western all  italiana  johnny yuma has the freshness of many wai made during the heyday of the genre and is highly recommended for fans of the genre or offbeat  intelligent cinema .  br    br   johnny yuma is  in most respects  not terribly original  but this actually does not count against it . the success of a genre film depends on how well it meets the audience  s expectations as well as provides surprising variations on these expected elements . earlier  pleasing experiences are recreated but with subtle  or major  twist that provide continuing interest . the quality of the execution is also  obviously  important . a tired retread will be less successful than a sincere attempt to entertain or move the audience .  br    br   given these criteria  johnny yuma succeeds . there are numerous reprises of elements from earlier films . the setting is the brutal  twisted semi  feudal twilight world of shared by many of the best  gothic family  westerns made          such as tempo di massacre       . the plot is a combination of the basic fistful of dollars       plot and the ringo films  a fact not surprising as screenwriter fendiando di leo was involved in both . di leo was one of the best screenwriters in the popular cinema coming out of cinecitta in the     s    s and his work helped provide much of the thematic continuities and coherency to the genre  along with a couple of other personalities in a few distinct circles of actors  directors  and screenwriters  . in the fod plot  the protagonist arrives in town  stirs up a tense situation  then undergoes a near  death followed by a resurrection  in some films  like quella sporca storia nel west       it is quite literally a crucifixion  . the catholic undertone to the narrative and the symbolism is intriguing  especially given the implicit populist  explicit socialist leanings of the filmmakers and their films . the ringo plot  developed more fully by screenwriter ernesto gastaldi in a series of films starring guliano gemma  a egoistic protagonist chooses the interest of a community over his own through the medium of a relationship with a member of that community  with a healthy dash ironic uncertainty  .  br    br   the relationship between carradine and johnny is clearly based on that of manco  mortimer from a fistful of dollar       . the two scene of the exchange of the gun belts provides a clever dialog and understanding between the two . numerous films  including da uomo a uomo       or even el chuncho  quin sabe         use this relationship between an older and younger man  father  son  older  younger brother  anglo adviser  adversary and peasant revolutionary  as a central dynamic to the plot .  br    br   additionally  there is the focus on deception and misdirection  mazes and mirrors  that recur throughout the best early wai . the canons and pueblos of almeria become literal mazes through which protagonist and antagonist play shifting games of cat and mouse .  br    br   what distinguishes johnny yuma from other wai is the quality of director romolo guerriri  s use of visual  psychological space together arrangement with the script  s intelligent mechanisms to forward the plot . dialogue was never very important to the wai and often absurdly unintelligible  thought there are exceptions  such as the cynical commentaries in django       or faccia a faccia       .  br    br   psychological depth of character is created almost entirely through iconic imagery  it  s juxtapositions  and it  s description of the overall narrative situation . see how the presence of the deadly samantha is felt during the beating scene  watching from the roof or from the background of the action . or how johnny strips samantha and pedro of their security and confidence in their power through his stealthy invasions of their ranch  hotel  even bedroom  this  again  is a theme from fod  . finally  note how there is a focus on the search for information . like many elements  this is borrowed from fod which was ultimately based on the hard  boiled mystery novel red harvest . it is through incidental contacts  wanted posters  overheard conversations  glances out of windows  watches left in the dust  or mistaken identities and movements through the ripples created by the actions of pedro and samantha within this surreal and absurd reality that the narrative tacks forward to it  s conclusion .  br    br   the movie was notable in it  s time for what were perceived of as excesses in violence . of course  these films were hardly more violent than many american westerns . what was different was the psychological intensity of the violence and the causes to which it was attributed  which is to say that it was not the violence but it  s meaning that had changed . johnny yuma is distinct and interesting in it  s use and portrayal of violence and this is another interesting aspect of the film .  br    br   what i personally find most interesting about most of this genre is the link it provides to the anonymous  nameless audiences in italy and spain to whom these recurrent narratives held some significance and interest . the artifact may have no intrinsic worth in and of itself  some flint debitage from a prehistoric site  a shard of cruse pottery  or a moldering piece of leather and rusted metal  but it is reference to some nameless presence  lives  that were significant simply because they existed . while johnny yuma has intrinsic worth  much of it  s interest for me derives from this connection and mystery .

you  ve got to admire director todd sheets for his dedication  drive and enthusiasm when it comes to movie  making between     and      he made a whopping   films . unfortunately  if his zombie bloodbath trilogy is anything to go by  they  re probably all crap  and a quick look at their imdb ratings seems to verify my hunch  .  br    br   part  sees a group of obnoxious students finding detention a little more eventful than usual after they are attacked by hordes of the living dead  who have escaped from a top  secret army base located directly beneath their school . working from a dreadful script by brian eklund  which relies heavily on liberal use of the f  bomb  director sheets delivers yet another embarrassingly amateurish effort featuring some mind  numbingly awful performances from his talent  free cast  dreadful visual effects  some crap cgi and what looks like the front of a giant cardboard space  shuttle  and his trademark shoddy gore  handfuls of offal pulled from beneath his victims  clothing  .  br    br   finally  after what seems like an eternity watching irritating characters running for their lives  and unconvincing undead people fondling animal innards  zombie armageddon finishes with a time  travel  paradox twist ending which forces viewers to re  watch several torturous minutes from the beginning of the film . honestly . . . once was enough  mr . sheetswhat have we done to deserve having to watch it again   ,0
i believe in keeping religion out of government and out of the movies . when i want a sermon  i  ll go to church  but i don  t want one from a movie . i don  t mind some supernatural themes   after all  religion is about as supernatural as you can get   but this movie had so much preaching in it that i was really annoyed . the landlady reminded me of witches that of seen in other movies . the bad guy even looked like he had horns .  br    br   and what a silly ending the hero went into the meeting and yelled at all of those old men  and that broke the spell . if only life were that simple . i think that when movies are that stupid  they ought to be distributed with a warning danger  preaching contained herein   ,0
yes i  ll say before i start commenting  this movie is incredibly underrated .  br    br   sharon stone is great in her role of catherine trammell as is morrissey as dr glass . he is an analyst sent in to evaluate her after the death of a sports star . glass is drawn into a seductive game that trammel uses to manipulate his mind .  br    br   the acting was good  apart from thewlis   br    br   stone really has a talent with this role . she  s slick  naughty and seductive and doesn  t look a day older than she did in the first . she really impressed me  like in casino  . morrisey was also good . he showed much vunerablitity in a role that needed it . thewlis however was lame . he ruined his character and was over  the  top the whole way . he really sucked .  br    br   overall  this movie not as good the first but stone is a hoot to watch . just ignore thewlis .  ,1
there are two reasons why i did not give a  to this movie . one reason are some of the actors  like malcolm mcdowell and gwynyth walsh  work  who tried to play at their usually good level of acting . however at many scenes they were somehow blocked by the bad scripting .  br    br   the other reason is the cool idea and looking of the cyborg  which is quite different to most other such roles i  ve seen so far .  br    br   everything else in this movie is as bad as it can be . boring scenes  useless and boring dialogs  bad script work . and it seemed as it was the first movie ever for many actors . it could have been an interesting story though  but they failed completely .  ,0
when people nowadays hear of a     s drama  they usually appear to create a distance of irony claiming that it  s another tearjerker with great stars in the lead of tragic  melancholic roles . this opinion  however  does not resemble neorealist movies  in particular this one directed by count luchino visconti . ossessione as his debut once censored and once cherished as nearly a realistic masterpiece is still loved by some people and strongly criticized by others . the contradictory opinions about the film that have appeared in these   years seem to have been caused by the content of the movie itself  exceptionally controversial for modern times as well as the past . at the same time  while being based on the novel by james m . cain  the postman always rings twice  it is one of the most genuine screen adaptations where director remains his own style  view  his own art . i have seen the film twice and the second viewing led me to very detailed analysis part of which i  d like to entail below .  br    br   first  visconti  s movie seems to touch all psychology and actions that people may do in life  in particular those absorbed by desire . these people make such tragic decisions in spite of terrible consequences they are bound to face . gino  massimo girotti  a traveler with  bear like shoulders  turns up at the crossroad of a motorway near ferrara and enters the tavern . although many people go there to have a meal  gino occurs to get something more  much more the indefatigable desire of beautiful giovanna  clara calamai  a woman already married to an elderly man who runs the bar  mr giuseppe bragana  juan de landa  . her body and her song possess his mind totally and from the moment of their first love  the couple plan to get rid of the old obstacle and build up a new life together . . . however  are people bound to wrong deeds in face of desire  can one build love upon murder  what is love and what is loyalty  does desire lead to a dangerous addiction or even obsession  such questions intensely arise while watching the movie  when  to the core  the viewer is supplied with an insight into characters .  we have to love each other affectionately  answers giovanna seemingly giving a cure to all crying conscience but may desirous love justify and cure everything   isn  t it what we both wanted  says one of the couple . . . it occurs that it  s not . therefore  the content of the film appears to be very dangerous if not analyzed with intellect and heart . yet  it constantly remains thought provoking .  br    br   second  ossessione has a very strong point that talks to modern viewers brilliant moments and marvelous cinematography  which go in pair with memorable sequences and visual power . these make a modern viewer realize that a film made almost   years ago is absolutely entertaining to watch . they range from tasteful erotic images to purely technical shots . who can possibly skip that moment in ferrara where gino meets a beautiful girl  a sort of  ragazza perfetta   perfect girl   a dancer anita and buys her ice cream . his desires show him totally different direction . . . do viewers remain indifferent at gino  giovanna  s first meeting  the first focus of camera is on giovanna  s legs seemingly representing carnal desire over love that gino experiences . a marvel of shot is gino and giovanna leaving the investigation room and the closeup of their shadows that directs our attention towards their suspicious look .  br    br   third  ossessione can boast outstanding performances both from the leading pair as well as the supporting cast . massimo girotti once said in an interview that working in this movie had been one of the most difficult jobs he had ever done yet  consequently  what comes out is a flawless acting . he portrays a bisexual man torn within desires who commits a crime but cannot stand any of the objects that remind him of his victim  which represents conscience . his bisexuality is indicated through the character of lo spagnolo  elio marcuzzo  whom he meets in very surprising circumstances in the train for ancona . clara calamai  who was cast in the role after eminent anna magnani had refused  fits very well to the role and we may claim that there is a true chemistry between the couple . they are both very convincing . besides  i liked juan de langa in the role of bragana he portrays an old husband not affectionate to his wife and still crazy about high art . in some of his most witty moments  he asks his wife to wash his back or walks in the empty streets singing his favorite opera songs after sort of karaoke performance .  br    br   in sum  we  as modern viewers who are capable of critical view  have to look at this film very objectively . it is art for sure thanks to the aspects aforementioned  it is a powerful story as well thanks to the controversy it carries yet  is it educational  visconti was not fellini who said that he did not carry any message for humanity . in such case  his films would only entertain  which is  of course  not entirely fellini  s style  too  . visconti always had something to convey . what did he want to say here  is the film against bad marriage  or is it against wrong actions of people absorbed by desire  the final shocking moments say for themselves . though you don  t have to agree with the vision  ossessione is really a wonderfully realistic film  one of visconti  s best      ,1
how many minutes does it take to paint a poem  in this film much too long .  br    br   it tells the story about the impact of a first love between two schoolboys .  br    br   the boys can  t withhold touching each other and making love . after a while one gets distracted by a brief encounter with a sensual guy in the disco and that raises doubt exploration  fantasy  longing  lust and feelings of loosing grip on your love are themes that are all extensively painted with music  close  ups and silent scenes like telling a poem . but it really takes too long  annoying long  shame  the effort was promising  ,0
how has this piece of crap stayed on tv this long  it  s terrible . it makes me want to shoot someone . it  s so fake that it is actually worse than a     s sci  fi movie . i  d rather have a stroke than watch this nonsense . i remember watching it when it first came out . i thought  hey this could be interesting  then i found out how absolutely  insanely  ridiculously stupid it really was . it was so bad that i actually took out my pocket knife and stuck my hand to the table .  br    br   please people  stop watching this and all other reality shows  they  re the trash that is jamming the networks and canceling quality programming that requires some thought to create .  ,0
i recently saw the broadway revival of  blithe spirit  starring angela lansbury  rupert everett  christine ebersole  and jayne atkinson . it  s a terrific production  and shows what good actors can do with a play that is less than perfect . angela lansbury is extremely funny as madame arcati .  br    br   it was probably a mistake  then  to check out the film version of the play starring rex harrison . the movie does not have the energy or the laughs of a good stage production .  br    br    blithe spirit  is probably one of those plays that works better with a live cast  in an audience full of people who have come to laugh . the actors can improvise  give touches and nuances to their performance and delivery of the lines  and involve the audience on a personal level that you can  t get in a movie house  or with a dvd showing  where the audience is separated from the story by the  fourth wall .  the story charles condomine  rex harrison   a successful writer  lives with his wife ruth  constance cummings  in a house in the english countryside . seeking information for his next book  a book dealing with the supernatural  charles invites madame arcati  margaret rutherford  reprising her role from the original     london production   a local spiritual medium  over to his house to conduct a sance . charles believes that spiritism is a sham  but hopes to pick up  the tricks of the trade .  but then madame arcati brings back the ghost of elvira  kaye hammond   charles  s first wife  who died of pneumonia seven years ago . elvira refuses to leave  and develops a spitting rivalry with ruth over charles  complicated by the fact that only charles can see or hear elvira  .  br    br   on stage  the actors can give performances that invite laughs in this situation . but on the screen  the actors in  blithe spirit  tear through the lines as if they don  t know that anyone is listening to them . they mumble lines that were designed to get laughs on the stage . the performances by harrison  cummings  and even kaye hammond are flat and lifeless . only margaret rutherford seems to have retained her spark and humor as madame arcati .  br    br   the oscar  winning visual effects in the film are unimpressive   not just by today  s standards  but by the standards of      they consist mostly of kaye hammond walking around in fluorescent green outfits and makeup  being photographed in special lighting to make her look like a glowing ghost .  br    br   the cinematographer deserves some credit for creative lighting . but compare the dull visual effects of  blithe spirit  to the truly groundbreaking effects in disney  s  song of the south    which was eligible for awards the same year . in  south   humans and animated characters share the screen seamlessly for minutes at a time . compared to  south   the oscar that  blithe spirit  received for special effects was completely undeserved .  br    br   at any rate  i can only encourage you to catch the broadway revival of this play with angela lansbury before it closes . as for the movie with rex harrison  skip it .  ,0
this show is not clever . that  s basically what it boils down to . the  original humor  that these writers try to pull off to avoid completely biting off the rest of the worlds bush bashing is just unfunny . in another comment  someone quotes a couple hilarious lines . the standout for me was george h . w . bush telling the kids they  re not supposed to watch any tv besides fox news . wow . i thought the episodes i saw were bad . the fact that this line is a high point for the series is pathetic .  br    br   my problem with drivel like this sad excuse for political satire is that these folks are getting a second season . i  m a liberal republican and i know bush hasn  t been a good president . we all do . but that  s no excuse for putting out this utterly poopie waste of time . i place these writers on the same level as the geniuses behind  meet the spartans  . their formula  bite off as many already unfunny topical jokes as you can and throw in even worse original material to actually be able to give yourself writing credit .  br    br   again  just plain bad . unfunny  and it just makes me more and more unhappy that crap like this is renewed  but amazing and original shows like arrested development are canned after  solid seasons . please don  t watch this crap  unless you  re one of those green blooded liberal hippies who think any sentence with the words bush and dumb is comedic gold .  br    br   oh  and the voice of bush sucks . all he does is slightly emulate a texan accent  and exhale really hard at the end of his sentences . at least south park admits the voices aren  t accurate . if you want funny political satire  watch daily show  colbert . or look for any political sketches on robot chicken  which is fun to watch  since the stop motion action figure animation is extremely well done . look for the george bush as a jedi bit on youtube . priceless  ,0

intelligent  wry  and thrilling   the invisible man  stood out in     among sci  fi  s usual lineup  balancing out  farscape   s fantastical art direction and sometimes melodramatic script with gritty  cynical plots and modern noir dialogue . the show sat between  law and order  and  doctor who  on the believability meter  but there was no denying the fact that  i  man   s characters went beyond caricature . even characters that verged on predictability like the keeper  the official  and eberts were given reprieves from the formulaic . paul ben  victor and vincent ventresca had a chemistry that evolved and shifted elegantly  made even more remarkable by the revolving door team of writers and directors . the effects are never allowed to overwhelm the plot  and the science only sometimes verged on the totally unbelievable . the show  s low points are still entertaining  and i  ve never seen such taut pilot episodes . matt greenberg and sci  fi should be commended  and fans have the right to demand a comprehensive dvd edition of the show . every time i come across a marathon of  hercules the legendary journeys  on sci  fi  i roll my eyes and sigh  mourning the excitement and possibility of science fiction television that  invisible man  and its ilk represented .  ,1
ok . i admit . i  m one of those nerds who have spent all to many hours with my beloved dvd player and my wonderful television set watching science fiction series . star trek  next generation  was my first space date  and since then i  ve switched partners regularly . i  ve seen  em all  it seems  and my favorites are lexx  farscape and the new battlestar galactica  in other words the newest  state of the art space operas . but  i also have a general crush on the old fashioned ones  the cheap ones  like the magnificent four seasoned bbc show blakes   . here  the budgets are smaller than hobbits  the special effects seem to be made on a commodore    but who cares when the scripts are sharp and intelligently written with dark humor  the acting dead serious and at times even high class   br    br   but why do they always speak english in the space future  because this is not the future  it  s fantasy for kids . still  it can be irritating at times . me  being a norwegian  have often damned this appalling fact that one never makes genre series  like science fiction  for scandinavian viewers . i never ever thought of the fact that this might have happened . but it did  actually  once  and even in my own homeland  norway . i was two years old when the so called fjernsynsteatret  tv theater section  of our national public service channel nrk produced this three episode version of blindpassasjer  the stowaway  .  br    br   when i first heard of it  i was not surprised of the fact that until this day  the show has only been screened once in norway  making it impossible for me to actually see it . it went on swedish  danish and finnish television also  in it  s time  but that was a long time ago . there have been no video or dvd release of it  not a surprise either  and when it was screened on an art house cinema  this happened in bergen  a city far far away from oslo  where i live  . and then there  s another fact about blindpassasjer that didn  t surprise me  that it was written by the two norwegian authors tor ge bringsvrd and jon bing  bingbringsvrd  . this duo basically introduced the scifi genre to norwegians in the seventies they published anthologies and wrote what they called fable prose . in my opinion  bringsvrd is the most interesting of the two writers  and has written several great and entertaining novels  masterpieces even  some of them hilarious  such as bazar and syvsoverskens dystre frokost . no other than this guy  also an acclaimed dramatist  could construct the script of blindpassasjer .  br    br   when i finally got to watch it  it was because a strange swede who recorded the three episodes on vcr in the    s  eventually managed to transform it to dvd and give it to me . he was a nice bloke . so i sat down and watched it  with swedish subtitles  bad sound and some scrapes and errors but the thing came through and i was surprised that i eventually came to love it .  br    br   the exterior scenes with the spaceships and planets are better than the ones in blakes   and the credit goes to caprino studios  who made the famous flklypa grand prix   and the interior of the marco polo  the space ship  works better than i  d expected . the acting is typically theatrical  but it works better than when they play ibsen  to put it mildly  and bjrn floberg carries his role solidly  as does trini lund . the legendary actress henny moan delivers her lines in a serious and laid back tone which fits the genre  but this is an ensemble play  and i  m happy to say that ola b . johannesen carries his mustache with nobility  and marit stbye is a really hot space chic of my standards .  br    br   but is it really that good  well  one have to swallow the rather abrupt ending  the pretentious criticism of modern society  but yes  it  s  well  not really really really fantastic  but charming  cool  nostalgic and pleasant . one and a half hour of classic norwegian scifi .  ,1
this movie isn  t very good . it  s boring  and not much blood for a horror film . the plot just trods along with not much happening . and i think the female vampire was so stupid . she had many chances to kill the vampire hunters since it shows her having lighting like reflexes . but  whenever she has one of them pinned  she just takes her time and something always happens where she doesn  t bite them . no wonder this went straight to cable .  br    br   final verdict not anywhere near as good as the first vampire movie . you  re a sucker if you waste your time on this .  ,0
somebody called howard koch a schlockmeister but he did write the screenplay for  casablanca   didn  t he  or didn  t he . maybe there  s more than one koch slinking around in hollywood  and i  m not too fond of  casablanca  anyway . wait a minute   yes  there is another howard koch slinking around hollwyood . that  s the one who wrote  casablanca .  no matter . i  ll put as much care into this comment as  howard w . koch  put into this production  which is to say only a little .  br    br   you know what this sounds like  somebody read cliff  s notes on shakespeare  s  king lear  and decided  since no original thoughts were aboard the inbound inspiration express  to update it and hollywoodize it with a happy ending .  br    br   there are differences . lear decides to divvy up his vast estates between three sisters and before doing so  asks them how much they love him . two of the sisters throw themselves at his feet and brown nose him to get at his money . the third is the good girl and refuses to go operatic on lear . but in the play  lear remains alive to regret his decision to give the two connivers his stash and deprive the honest girl . he winds up crazy and naked during a gale on the moors  putting flowers in his hair and hallucinating . kids can do that to you .  take my kid  for instance . after all the effort i squandered on raising him  does he show any interest in becoming a doctor or a lawyer  no .  in the end  everybody in the play dies .  br    br   in the movie  evidently  the good sister is morose and suicidal but when she tries to off herself  somebody jumps in and saves her  so the ending is  more or less  happy . that  s the difference between hollywood and a genuine tragedy  unless you define hollywood as a tragedy sufficient unto itself .  ,0
i love these actors  but they were wasted in this flick .  br    br   i can only wonder  what were they thinking agreeing to this crap     br    br   debra winger just phoned it in dennis quaid and arliss howard were caricatures . some people thought it was deep . well  if you liked  breaking the waves   you  ll probably like this too . i hated both .      ,0
annie potts is the only highlight in this truly dull film . mark hamill plays a teenager who is really really really upset that someone stole the corvette he and his classmates turned into a hotrod  quite possibly the ugliest looking car to be featured in a movie   and heads off to las vegas with annie to track down the evil genius who has stolen his pride and joy .  br    br   i would have plucked out my eyes after watching this if it wasn  t for the fun of watching annie potts in a very early role  and it  s too bad for hamill that he didn  t take a few acting lessons from her . danny bonaduce also makes a goofy cameo .  ,0
  br    br    step aside for hollywood veterans    the wayan brothers were  asked   thats what hollyweird demanded and thats what it got . however  like so many of its recent decisions this one was a stupendous mistake .  br    br   the director is so out of touch with todays audience  attempting to bring back physical pratfalls and gags in place of funny dialogue is just a disaster . i knew it  the audience knew it and the cast knew it .  br    br   what a shame  why did they ever consider changing directors  not only that but the two wayan brothers played as two of four primary characters  without them its just a farce and a sad one .  br    br   sp  br    br    ,0
this show is good . i like the acting  funny bits and the cuteness of it . the actors  lee pace  ann friel . . . etc  they all did great in the show . the show started off great with its funny  illogical basic idea of bringing dead people back in the first series and honestly  as what people said  the first few episodes of the second series were a bit of a let down but it later came back looking good anyway . and now i really hate the fact that it  s going to be cancelled . why doesn  t abc just let it finish until the very end when all the episodes are already done   i really wanna know how the story  s going to be . i think it should be given a chance as there  re still so many viewers who love it .  ,1
probably my all  time favorite movie  a story of selflessness  sacrifice and dedication to a noble cause  but it  s not preachy or boring . it just never gets old  despite my having seen it some   or more times in the last   years . paul lukas  performance brings tears to my eyes  and bette davis  in one of her very few truly sympathetic roles  is a delight . the kids are  as grandma says  more like  dressed  up midgets  than children  but that only makes them more fun to watch . and the mother  s slow awakening to what  s happening in the world and under her own roof is believable and startling . if i had a dozen thumbs  they  d all be  up  for this movie .  ,1
houseboat horror is a great title for this film . it  s absolutely spot  on  and therefore the only aspect of the film for which i can give   out of   . there are houseboats  there is horror  there  s even horror that takes place on houseboats . but if there were ever a tagline for the film poster  it would surely be  something shonky this way comes . . .  for houseboat horror is easily the worst australian horror film i  ve ever seen  not to mention one of the worst horror films i  ve ever seen  and a fairly atrocious attempt at film  making in general . the good news is  it  s so bloody awful  it sails straight through the zone of viewer contempt into the wonderful world of unintentional hilarity . it  s worth watching because it  s bloody awful .  br    br   the category of  worst  comes not from the storyline  for the simple reason that there actually is one a record producer  a film crew and a rock band drive up to the mystifyingly  named lake infinity  a picturesque rural retreat somewhere in victoria  in reality lake eildon  to shoot a music video . someone isn  t especially happy to see them there and  possibly in an attempt to do the audience a favour  starts picking them off one by one with a very sharp knife . even more mystifying is how long it takes the survivors to actually notice this   br    br   on the surface  it looks like a very bog  standard b  movie slasher . you  ve got highly  annoying youths  intolerant elders  creepy locals  one of whom  a petrol station attendant  would easily win a gurning competition   and let  s face it  my description of the murderer could easily be jason voorhees . ah  but if only the acting and production values were anywhere near as good as the comparative masterpiece that was friday the   th part vii . unfortunately  houseboat horror is completely devoid of both these things .  br    br   but in the end  this only makes what you do get so ridiculous and amusing . fans of one  time  late show  and  get this  member tony martin will already be aware of some of the real dialogue gems   check out the view . . . you  ll bar up     while the actual song to accompany the music video is so bad it has to be heard to be believed  i can  t help wondering if writer  director ollie wood hoped it would actually become a hit . the horror element is comparable i think to b  slashers of the genre and particularly of the period  but there were times when i couldn  t help imagining someone biting into a hamburger off  screen and seeing a volley of tomato sauce sprayed at the wall on  screen .  br    br   indeed  if you  ve been listening to tony martin recommending this film as hilarious rubbish like myself  i don  t think you  ll be disappointed . any fans of  so  bad  it  s  good  horror should not pass up the opportunity . whether you  ll  bar up  or not though is another matter . if  on the other hand  you are in search of genuine excellence in the australian horror genre  get yourself a copy of the incomparable  long weekend  and don  t look back .  ,0
at last  a decent british comedy that isn  t centred around some mockney bank robbers or spun off from a tv series . john ivay  s film is a psychoactive tale of discovery  dressed in biker gear . the three protagonists are gentle fools with a penchant for failure and each at a turning point in their lives  giving a sensitive  emotional trio of sub  plots to sew the riotous comedy together . the chemistry between the three amigos is palpable and makes for a touching companionship with hilarious dialogue and some classic comedic moments . it feels part withnail and i  part american werewolf in london  and part quadraphenia  but only because of the bike gangs  and phil daniels  . in fact  phil daniels  lovable rogue reminds you of danny the dealer in withnail and i  with his scholarly approach and scientific commitment to drugs . this is a great film  particularly for those who  ve dabbled in psychoactive substances in the past  who will relate to many moments in the film . a personal favourite is the brilliant scene in the welsh corner shop  buying munchies while tripping on  shrooms . this gentle comedy will warm the cockles of your heart and have you laughing out loud . and you don  t have to ride bikes or even like them to enjoy it . but it  ll add to it if you do . brilliant .  ,1
very good western . this was the first time writer richard wilson directed a film  also this was a first for samuel goldwyn junior as a producer . it is a pleasure to see a very young and pretty angie dickinson as a saloon girl . robert mitchum comes to this town dominated by outlaws and is hired as a town tamer  but people are worried that he will go too far  also about the harm that he will do to the towns businesses . there are some similarities in the story with  warlock  which was made in     . this film keeps a very fast and exciting pace  it really keeps you on the edge .  ,1

this show had pretty good stories  but bad dialog . the main character was especially annoying . it  s quite obvious why this show was canceled  although  like most upn shows  i never knew it even existed until it was in syndicated re  runs .  br    br   most of it  s plots seemed to be copied from other shows and movies  leading me to think the producers didn  t have an original idea in their heads .  br    br   i haven  t commented enough . you  ve got to have at least ten lines of text . the special effect were not bad for a     show .  br    br   the gnome was a nice character .  ,0
i  ll keep the review of this program as short as possible . skip it . low budget  not funny  lousy script . acting not quite as bad as the writing  but still bad . that  s all you need to know  but i will continue for the sake of writing more than necessary .  br    br   this is a film with three segments  each one parodying some other type of movie . a much funnier film with this same exact idea is  movie movie   with george c . scott . very obscure  but worth searching out . mm parodied films of the      s  and did it with elegance  precision and dry wit .  br    br   this movie did not . it parodies three types of films  supposedly from the late    s  early    s era  only it is parodying films i  ve  almost  never heard of . the first is  i guess  a parody of  kramer vs . kramer   in a way . peter reigert does his best with a dirt poor script . the second is a parody  of  i don  t know what . . . a danielle steele novel  i mean  you might see a story like this on lifetime tv  but in a movie theater  i mean  i remember the    s  i was there . this is a soap  opera type parody about a fetching young woman who sleeps her way to power . these type of things usually parody themselves  so i don  t see how this was even necessary .  br    br   we are on somewhat easier ground with the third segment   the municipalians   which parodies cop movies . i noted elements of  the new centurians  and some  dirty harry   both of which were almost   years old when the film was created . yeah  nice and current . robby benson plays the idealistic young rookie  over  the  top wimpy  while richard widmark plays the grizzled veteran cop who drinks whiskey while sitting in the police car  oh  stop  my sides  he  s actually drinking booze in the police car  how irreverent   note that this was the first film after  animal house  to have the  national lampoon  name attached . wow . to go in five years from that classic flick to this pile of dung is nothing short of shocking . i could go on for hours about the sad decline that caused one of the most cutting  edge and original voices in american humor  that would be national lampoon  the original magazine for about its first   years or so  to sell out and begin a long  slow slide into a world of crap  where now the magazine is long gone and it only exists as a brand name to slap on low  budget  comedy  films for a fee . yet another reason why capitalism  and cocaine  sucks so bad .  br    br   anyway  this movie is a serious time suck . don  t waste your   minutes . i want mine back . on the positive side  fred willard  s in it   ,0

i wanted to punch the tv . watching it was torture . i hated it . never watch this movie . the terrorists are annoying . adam sandler is annoying . i normally like him but not in this one . i wanted to break the dvd . this is the most irritating film in the world . the comedian he  s jealous of is obnoxious . the only remotely funny part is the rocker with the black teeth getting all the girls . it was so irritating i wanted to punch the tv . do not buy this movie unless you want to annoy someone . if you even like adam sandler a little bit  don  t buy it . it will just make you hate him . do yourself a favor  if you see it in the store  hide it to put everyone out of danger of buying it . its a waste of the   .   i paid for it .  ,0
the comment by  eliz        hits the proverbial  nail on the head  for this turkey of a program . but it is a hoot to watch william shatner  cavort  and  dance   yes  the   marks on the word dance are necessary for what bill does  . this show would be a great skit on snl or mad tv  and it does rate a few stars for one viewing  or so  to see shatner  who seems to have taken  camp  to new heights  whether in a role or as himself . but the guy is funny .  br    br   the girls who are in the cubicle areas with the game data scrolls  will be pretty much out  of  luck when this turkey is canceled  unless there is a revival of the whiskey  a  go  go genre  with a resurrected demand for shapely young women to dance in elevated cages once more .  br    br   i watched the first contestant  who was annoying  and literally  dumber than a post   yet through sheer luck  walked away with a quarter mil or so . the second contestant  somewhat more intelligent  but who  d be lucky to gain       on jeopardy   got zonked by the card which requires answering a special question  which he didn  t know  and thereby left with zilch .  br    br   this plethora of game shows  which dangle  and sometimes award  large sums to everyday individuals  are admittedly a cheap effort  overall  to attempt to woo viewers . even if the host is well  compensated  and they give away six figures in an average episode  i suppose that the revenue versus costs can be favorable  since you don  t have a sitcom cast where several stars are getting six or seven figures  per episode  with some big residual deals as well .  br    br   but i suspect even the better ones will wear thin before long . this one has already pretty much reached this point . i think his offerings  especially with james spader  and the others on  boston legal  should give us a satisfying quantity of bill shatner  s offerings .  br    br   again  the above rating is simply appropriate to view bill hoot and prance  perhaps one time that should be sufficient .  ,0
  nat   voiced by trevor gagnon   along with his brainiac friend  iq   voiced by philip bolden  and the always hungry  scooter   david gore  are kids with big dreams . they want to be the first flies in space . and what encourages their dreams is the first spacecraft to land on the moon  the apollo    is waiting for its historic trip on the launch pad near where the three hang out .  br    br   the first thing you notice is the animation of the film . i found it done very well done . the scenery had depth to it  as things in the distance actually looked like they were behind the focus of the scenes . i didn  t see the movie in   d  as it was broadcast on hbo . however  i could see that there really wasn  t any scenes which took advantage of the   d effects except a fight between characters near the end . i also wasn  t really impressed with the design of the characters . to me  they didn  t look like anything resembling a fly  especially in the coloring . the flies were an unusual blue  gray that was kind of distracting to me .  br    br   the performances from the cast was not bad  but it wasn  t good either . there were many times i focused more on my computer than the story . the writing was certainly written for a younger audience  with comedic moments that will make younger kids laugh . i saw nothing for adults  like jokes that they  ll get the punchline for the adults to understand the meaning .  br    br   history was not followed in this film . in fact  i think it was completely ignored  as the main focus was the flies . i also hated when a well known astronaut popped up on the screen and explained that the stories about the flies in the film was a work of fiction  and no flies were on apollo   . i did like how he thanked the men and women who sacrificed their lives for space exploration though .  br    br   if you are an adult  this is not for you . it was not made for the entire family . this is certainly just for kids . but  save this one for a rainy day .  ,0

this is the fifth von trier film i have seen . i believe that he is the only director to whom i have given such a high score on all his movies . four of them  the element of crime  europa  breaking the waves  and dancer in the dark  i have given a    and one  the idiots  i have given a   and i have been reconsidering whether to give it a   since i first saw it  although i  d like to see it once more before i do  . he has been chided for calling himself one of the best working directors . i tend to agree with him . i cannot blame him for being arrogant when he has made such great films . in   years  when von trier retires  he will be looked upon as the pre  eminent film artist from europe  perhaps from the planet   and there will be classes taught in his name . he simply is the bergman or fellini of our time . it is too bad the critics are too intrigued with themselves to notice this .  br    br   about europa itself  i  ll admit that it was confusing and that its narrative did not seem strong . i think that  s the point . this film was obviously meant to represent a nightmare  or the subconscious at some level . this is absolutely clear from the framing of the film max von sydow  s narration . we are hypnotized  or von trier is hypnotized  and this is our  his subconscious mind . i  m inclined to lean more towards his mind  since the degradation of europe concerns me  an american  very little . this framing is also clear if you have seen the element of crime  an even more brilliant film than this  although i am disputing that in my mind what europa needs more than anything is a proper release on dvd  hopefully criterion again  with theatrical aspect ratio and remastered sound and picture then  i am fairly sure  this film would seem as great as any of von trier  s other films  . in the element of crime  the film begins with a hypnotist  whom we actually see on screen this time  is hypnotizing fisher  a european detective who wants to get to the root of his mental anguish . the first words of that film are  fantasy is okay  but my job is to keep you on track .  and whenever fisher  the narrator  gets off track  the hypnotist does chastize him and tells him to get back on with the story . he even laughs when a character is given a really silly and trite line . something along the lines of   do you understand the difference between good and evil   the hypnotist laughs and says   now  fisher  she didn  t really say that  did she    br    br   so the key to interpreting europa  almost a sequel of sorts to the element of crime  is that we are deep in our  von trier  s subconscious  and the symbols there are to be interpreted within ourselves and will likely be different for everyone . what does the train itself symbolize  consider it internally  and only then discuss it externally . europa is a great film  a masterpiece . i was never bored by it  even though i watched it at  am . the perfect time to watch  actually  since it works in dream logic .  ,1
warning contains many spoilers   br    br   let me start by saying i have a huge respect for gillian anderson  s incredible talent as a varied and versatile actress  which is why i cannot comprehend her reasons for agreeing to make this film once she saw the script  or lack thereof .   br    br   the premise of the film was  in my opinion  a great idea and there were some genuinely thought  provoking themes in there but it ended up like a collapsed souffl . it exemplifies why i hate    of british cinema . it feels too long  it  s tedious  for the most part  and not a lot happens after the first twenty minutes . just when you think there  s a chance of it picking up some speed it disappoints like paula radcliffe running a marathon . with little imaginative directing and a minimalist plot  there isn  t much to keep the audience from nodding off into their popcorn . as for the script i can only surmise that the writer was trying to save a few trees  with the average scene reading something along the lines of  alice f off   adam stares . adam runs off into woods   alice follows  alice adam  adam   i suspect that  word for word  the actors probably got paid more than kate moss did for her virgin mobile adverts . what few lines there were didn  t have a lot of variation with a frequent use of the f  word that would make bridget jones  s friend  shazza  proud . there is little establishment of the main characters before the main sordid event which leaves the audience lacking much sympathy for the characters beyond an automatic  oh that  s terrible  reaction .  br    br   alice isn  t the kind of woman who courts sympathy either . she  s got a great job  an expensive london apartment with roof space to die for yet she comes across on screen as conceited  bitter and dissatisfied before her life takes a turn for the worst . after the attack a few layers are peeled back which sort  of explain why she is this way to start with she grew up with a tough  as  old  boots soldier who thought that teaching her how to shoot his gun was the ultimate expression of love so  instead of following in his footsteps  she ran away to the big city in search of something to make her feel like her life is worth living . instead she found a group of stereotypical middle  class toffs who look down on anyone not rich enough to drive a lexus and the luxuries that come with an integrated security  entertainment system  i . e . becoming mrs robinson to a wanna  be cockney wide  boy electrician  someone pass me a tissue . the one saving grace of this character is that she is played by gillian anderson . in the hands of a lesser actress she would  ve been intolerably one  dimensional but ms anderson actually manages to inject a few fleeting moments of humanity into this otherwise lifeless human being  most notably when she  s sincerely apologising for her road rage in a vain attempt to stop her attackers from continuing their assault .  br    br   i can  t say that adam fared much better either . danny dyer played him well as a fish  out  of  water jack the lad but a good performance couldn  t save him from both the lack of a script and the total absence of any character background .  br    br   this film relied mostly on shock value but the timing was off and it felt far too engineered from beginning to end . as for the shock  the most shocking thing about this film is the unashamed demonstration of how painfully thin ms anderson has become it was almost as unsettling to see as the brutal attack scenes . on a side note  only in a british film would a gang of violent sex attackers take the time to offer each other contraception before continuing to cheer their mates on  talk about stiff  upper  lip taken to the extreme  if this is the kind of film that the national lottery is donating money to make then i  m not surprised that fewer and fewer people are choosing to spend their pound each week .  br    br   saying that i hated this film is giving it too much credit  i didn  t care enough about any of the characters to warrant that strong an emotion . i want that one  and  a  bit hours of my life back  please   ,0
this is just a great  fun  lovely film . it captures the true essence of the decade and of the people  and tells a beautiful love story of two sisters with two sailors . though this film may only be in black and white  it definitely doesn  t count against it now in modern days . the main basic purpose of the movie is timeless . this movie features great acting  beautiful song and dance numbers  and great design work and film shots . follow the fleet is also comical  there are funny moments  moments that will make you laugh  but other moments where the acting just gets you so involved into the storyline . its amazing how though this movie may be set in a certain decade  how it can affect those today . if you want to see something great  check this out .  ,1
arrrrrggghhhhhh  some people take life far too seriously    watch this film for what it is  sit back  relax and have a giggle . the film does not take itself seriously  so neither should we . if you like james belushi  you will like this film . if he is not your cup of tea  give it a miss .  br    br   i like james belushi  so i liked this film . so simple isn  t it       ,1
i shudder to think what people must have thought of environmentalists after viewing this piece of overbearing  preachy cinematic trash . larded with enough indian  wannabe nuttery and space brother buffoonery to stock a new  age shop  starlight makes anyone who gives a damn about the planet look like a feather  wearing crystal  fondling idiot .  br    br   the plot  alien rae dawn chong arrives to guide a flute playing underwear model in a mystical quest to avert earth  s impending environmental collapse . but first they must defeat an evil alien who looks nothing so much like a refugee from a castro street bar . fortunately  they  ve got mystical grandpa willie nelson along to help  who looks faintly embarrassed by the proceedings  as well he ought to be  along with buckets of cheap f  x and reams of pointlessly swelling music .  br    br   sure  the clunky script helps to obscure the film  s trite plot and staggering pace  but that  s just the tip of this melting movie iceberg . everyone concerned with this film should have their union cards revoked until they complete a real course in environmental science .  ,0
a fine effort for an australian show . which is probably not surprising seeing as there seems to be somewhat of a resurgence in quality aussie drama . dare i compare this show to the brilliance of love my way  no . but it is reminiscent of early secret life of us . the cast is great  gibney works her magic in the first two episodes i have seen  the british cast is strong also especially the callum and lizzie characters . but abe forsythe may be the saving light  not that it needs saving  if this show is to get another season . i wasn  t a fan of his performance in the awesomely awesome marking time mini series a few years back but he was great as hal in always greener . its also good to see brooke satchwell again . lets hope the show keeps improving with each episode .  ,1
what can you possibly say about a show of this magnitude   the sopranos  has literally redefined television as we know it . it has broken all rules  and set new standards for television excellence . everything is flawless  the writing  directing  and for me  most of all  the acting . watching this show you  ll find yourself realizing that these characters are not real . the acting tricks you into thinking there is a real tony soprano  or any character . this show is also very versatile . some people don  t watch the show because it  s violent  it  s not all about the violence  it  s about business  family  and many deeper things that all depend on what you  as a fan see . for me  i don  t like when people refer to the show  a show about the mafia . for me  it  s a show about family . a family who  through generations  happen to be apart of the mob . overall this is a masterpiece of a show . this is what television should be . right here . complex characters from stunning acting  magnificent story lines from brilliant writing  and what do you get when you mix these ingredients together  a show that defines excellence  and dares to be different .  ,1
i couldn  t wait to see this movie . about half way through the movie  i couldn  t wait for it to end . all of the  white  actors were delivering their lines like woody allen had just said   say it like this . . .  then they said their lines on screen like they were trying to imitate woody allen . it was so annoying . we all know how will ferrell really talks  and he doesn  t stumble over his words like mr . allen . the comedy portion of this film was just as boring as the tragedy and definitely never funny or even entertaining . i must admit that i have never been a major woody allen fan  and this movie definitely has not converted me . i think that his writing was just as bad as his direction . this movie will go down as one of the worst   movies i have ever seen .  ,0
i for one have shamelessly enjoyed every episode of pushing daisies this season  and hope that the writers  strike won  t brutally end the beginnings of a very good show . ned is a pie maker who owns a restaurant in the middle of town and has a secret talent . emmerson is a private investigator with his own unique quirks like his love of knitting . charlotte  chuck  is the once  dead  but  not  anymore childhood friend and sunny spot of ned  s life . olive is the jealous but good  hearted waitress . oh  and add the dog . jim dale brings all the characters together with his wonderful narration of the show . chuck  ned  and emmerson along with olive and occasionally the dog solve multiple murder mysteries with the assistance of ned  s special gift of bringing dead people back to life . the show is funny  clean  and romantic in a very cute and good  hearted way  and i  d recommend it to anyone .  ,1
mcconaughey in a horror  thriller  i had to see this . i was pleasantly surprised .  br    br   the plot is told in flashback mode  and it concerns an otherwise normal and happy family of three going through a very bizarre predicament . i can  t say much more without spoiling the whole movie  sorry . just know that if you decide to watch it  you  ll be  in the very least  surprised .  br    br   all the main players are very good . bill paxton did a great job directing those kids  and his acting is awesome . mcconaughey  s acting is solid throughout and fits the bill perfectly .  br    br   this movie challenges you to think . is dad crazy  is there a god  do demons exist  how far would you go to right a wrong . and what is  right  anyway  i  m still thinking .  br    br   and thus i recommend  frailty  .     and this is one of those movies that deserves and rewards a second  or even third viewing .  ,1
here  s a decent mid     s horror flick about a gate of hell in nyc that just happens to be an old brownstone . seems like there  s lots of gates of hell around  but of course this unwitting model happens to decide she needs some space from her boyfriend  fiance and so she just happens to pick one  which is disguised as a nice and reasonably priced apartment . she meets several strange neighbors  and even attends a birthday party for a cat . upon meeting with the realtor because she hears strange noises at night from upstairs  she finds out that she and an old priest are supposed to be the only tenants . whoa  then who are all these weirdos  her boyfriend  a slimy lawyer  played by chris sarandon  starts poking around and finds that things are not what they seem  not by a long shot . this has some decent creepy scenes and the idea of the creaky old folks that are her  sometimes  neighbors being other than what they appear is fairly intriguing . a bit of decent gore and even a parade of less  than  normal folks towards the end make this a decent watch  and while i  ve seen this many times on tv the uncut dvd version is much better  of course . not a bad little horror flick  maybe a good companion piece to  burnt offerings  .  out of   .  ,1
two thirds of nearly      imdb users who have voted on this film have rated it at    or   and one user reports wearing out six videotapes  was this a record  or merely a faulty vcr   . although the film is primarily intended as a period piece it clearly has a quite unusual fascination . but for some reason i imagined it as largely whimsy and until recently never felt the urge to watch it . my mind was changed by elizbeth von arnim  s original book . my wife loves reading but her sight no longer allows her to read much so she borrowed it in talking book form . such books are usually irritating to a companion who is busy with other things  but i gradually came to appreciate that this one was seductively soothing  although in no way syrupy  and was also very well written . i realised my wife would enjoy watching the film  and so decided to buy her the videotape . i am now very glad that i did  and would certainly recommend its purchase to anyone else who appreciates a quiet reflective work with no fireworks but with well constructed character development and a very successful pre  mussolini italian atmosphere . the story is set in the immediate post ww  period and starts with two married london ladies who decide to pool their savings and enjoy a holiday together  away from their families  in a rented villa in italy . force of circumstances lead to this couple being joined by two others with very different characters and backgrounds . its theme is essentially no more than the interactions that take place as their holiday progresses  not only between these four very disparate mature ladies  but also with the occasional male visitor . if you want action  thrills  dramatic sex scenes  natural or man  made disasters  or harlequin style romances this would not be the film for you . but imdb users have collectively and very emphatically demonstrated that none of these are necessary for a film to prove highly rewarding to watch  and if you care to give it a try you may  as i did  come to rank it among your much loved films .  br    br   it is fairly rare for me to watch a film of a book with which i am already familiar . in many cases i find this takes some of the pleasure away from watching the film  but here there is such a strong visual appeal in the setting that i actually found my pleasure augmented by the anticipation of seeing the next segment of the book  effectively unrolled before my eyes .  perhaps italy itself has some part in this  the last time i had this experience was when i was watching tales from boccaccio  s decameron on tv .  generally films of books tend to increase the dramatic level of the original work to ensure that the filmed version has an even wider appeal  but here if anything it is reduced in order to keep the viewers attention on the gradual character development rather than on any background events . this works very well  although changes from the book are few and basically the film remains true to the original story . great credit is due to the director  mike newell  and all members of the cast  particularly those well known british actresses who play the four principal ladies .  ,1
 . . . said a couple exiting the movie theater just as i was entering to watch this . hmm  not a good sign  but who knows  different strokes for different folks  after all . well  nope . they were being kind . godard has released work that is passionate  contempt   entertaining  band of outsiders   sometimes both  my life to live  . this is just dull intellectualism  that grates on the nerves pretty quickly . during my showing  literally half of the audience had walked out by the end of the film . if only i had been so wise .  ,0
this is the most boring worthless piece of crap i  ve ever wasted an hour of my life on . all i can say is thank god it was only an hour . over half of this  movie  is footage from the original  criminally insane  . at the very least  i was able to see the highlights from that rare exploitation classic  since for some reality  defying reason my video store only has  criminally insane ii   as it had it   crazy fat ethel ii   . but the rest of this movie is some of the absolute worst home  video acting and backyard filmmaking you  ll ever see . why is it my video store has this and not the original  why does stuff like this actually end up in video stores  why do people rent it and not immediately burn the copy once they  ve seen its sheer horror  why  aauugghh  why  god  why   br    br   unless you enjoy seeing annoying fruits eating an entire candy bar in an excruciatingly slow scene  or said fruit getting hung from the stair railing in an even slower scene  or a character getting stabbed sideways  don  t ask  multiple times in the back  or brain cell  murdering monologues about giving poisoned tea to one  s wife and then complaining that all the talk has made one  s own tea go cold  or the mentally  retarded eating fly soup  or just simply want to see crazy fat ethel dancing with a bloody knife in a garden don  t watch this movie . repeat do not watch this movie . do not rent this movie . if at all possible  do not walk past a shelf in a video store that has a copy of this movie setting on it . you can still be saved  but it is too late for me now . . .  ,0
i know  i know   plan  from outer space  is the worst movie  or maybe  manos  the hands of fate .  but i can  t get worked up over those sock  monkey movies . of course they  re bad . how could they be any good  but if you  re talking about movies with respectable production values and bankable talent  the t . rex of all turkeys has to be  yentl .  all the treacly phoniness  all the self  absorbed asininity  that stains everything barbra streisand has done since      reaches its culmination in this movie . from its lonely summit of awfulness   yentl  looks back to  a star is born  and forward to  the mirror has two faces .  there is nothing else quite like it . what emotional undertow dragged streisand out to make this movie i would rather not speculate  and what audience she was playing to i cannot possibly imagine  although i  ll bet there  s a nine in ten chance you aren  t a member of it .  br    br   nobel prize  winner and saintly guardian of yiddish literature isaac bashevis singer was so outraged by what streisand did to his story that he blasted her in public for it . it is a tribute to streisand  s impenetrable vulgarity that she not only didn  t commit suicide  but went on to make more awful movies .  ,0
this is one of may all  time favourite films . parker posey  s character is over  the  top entertaining  and the librarian motif won  t be lost on anyone who has ever worked in the books and stacks world .  br    br   if you  re a library student  rent this . then buy the poster and hang it on your wall . the soundtrack is highly recommendable too . i  ve shown this film to more library friends than any other   they all fall in love with it .  ,1
jean harlow and clark gable were a great on screen team and this may be their best movie together .  br    br   yes  hold your man can be cheesy and predictable  but that  s not what i love about the movie . i love seeing harlow and gable together and in this film they are simply wonderful . it is obvious that they really enjoyed working together and that is part of what makes this such a wonderful film .  br    br   the witty dialogue  great script and attention to detail are the other things that make this such a good movie . i loved this movie the first time i saw it and on each subsequent viewing i always notice at least one new detail . to me  that is a mark of a great film .  br    br   the dialogue and script are better than most movies from this time period  early    s  . i adore classic movies  but i admit that most of them are just average and at times don  t hold my interest . hold your man is one of the exceptions .  br    br   this has a lot to do with the fact that hold your man is a  pre  code  movie .  the hays code was not enforced until a year after hold your man .  this movie could not have been made under the code . well  it could have been made  but it would have been an entirely different story . thank goodness the code was not enforced until     . otherwise  we would have missed out on this gem .  ,1
i was sooooo excited to see this movie after finally reading the book this week . my   year old son was looking forward to it too . i rented it and snuggled down to enjoy a classic holiday story brought to life on screen .  br    br   boy  was i disappointed . this movie veered off from the book more times than is forgivable . george c . scott is an excellent actor but in this  it seemed that he was fully into character only about    of the time . the rest of the time he was quite flat .  br    br   i realize that this was made in     pre  cg effects  for the most part . but it looked to be very b  movie quality  especially the encounter with jacob marley .  br    br   the biggest disappointment was the fact that they left out one of the most moving parts of the story when the spirit of christmas present takes scrooge on the whirlwind tour of the world  observing people in the bleakest of circumstances still having the light and love of christmastime .  br    br   i will admit that mr . scott did a good job with the  reformed  scrooge at the end . that was a refreshing portrayal .  br    br   i wish that bob cratchit had been portrayed as a little more ragged and down  trodden . and tiny tim . . . oh don  t even get me started on bad child actors . . .  ,0
the show  s echoed  bubbling  sound effect used to put me to sleep . a very soothing show . i think i might have slept through the parts where there was danger or peril . i had also heard that some set up shots for a show on sponge divers was shot in tarpon springs  florida . i would assume lloyd bridges never dove there . i only remember the show in reruns and although it was never edge  of  the  seat exciting we would make up our own underwater episodes in the lake at my grandmother  s house . . . imagining the echoed bubbling sounds and narrating our adventures in our heads . i thought  flipper  had better undersea action . of course  he had the advantage of being in his natural environment .  ,0
though the title may suggest examples of the   commandments  it is a definitely incorrect assumption . this is an adaptation of  seemingly unrelated stories from giovanni bocaccio  s   th century  decameron  story collection .  br    br   set within a medieval italian town  s largely peasant population  it is a diatribe on the reality of sex  and its consequences  within that world and time . a realistic view of life within this world  it sometimes feels like a journey back in time .  br    br   given the depicted human element of its time  one can also see the more adventurous side of morality in its protagonists  as well as the ironies of life  at times . or it may also be viewed as a general satire of the catholic church  s rules .  br    br   nothing terribly special  but definitely interesting if one comes with no expectations or assumptions .  ,0
i was at this film  s premiere at the toronto film festival in     . after the screening  when the writer  director and some cast members offered to answer questions  no one could even be bothered to ask any . rarely has a film been so poorly directed  why on earth were random frames snipped out of some scenes    wretchedly acted  david arquette  to paraphrase dorothy parker  does not run the emotional gamut from a to b . he parks at a and brings a lunch  and utterly pointless . characters behave completely out of character for no reason except to force the plot to move in certain directions . at long last  the film comes to a completely random and pointless end that  s supposed to  really make you think .  unfortunately  what it makes you think is   well  there  s   minutes of my life i  m never getting back .   ,0
seriously  i absolutely love these old movies and their simplicity but i just watched this for the first time last night and it easily slotted itself into my bottom five of all time . was this supposed to be about the love story or the zombies    this movie was so bad that after it mercifully ended all i could do is laugh at how ridiculously bad it really was . thankfully i  m too anal to turn a movie off without seeing the entire thing or i wouldn  t be able to brag about watching this all the way through in one sitting  i like to think something positive can be said about anything in life so in keeping with that theory i will acknowledge this film  s most positive asset  it was very short for a full length film .  ,0
 . . . this would have been what you got .  br    br   words alone cannot describe how bad this is . if you  re having trouble sleeping pop this in and i guarantee you  ll be out in fifteen minutes .  br    br   robert lowery was a pretty good actor in the   s   but he  s phoning it in here . in an interview  johnny  duncan  robin said that in one scene he and batman had to run from the car to the house and that lowery was doubled over out of camera range because his girdle was too tight  duncan himself looks more like a motorcycle hood than a boy wonder   in fact he  s more like a guy in his thirties waiting for lowery to kick off so he can wear the big cape .  br    br   driving a batmobile that looks like it rolled off honest al  s used car lot at below sticker price   the dynamic duo don  t put a lot of effort into hiding the fact that it  s bruce wayne  s car they  re driving   in fact it  s noted by several characters throughout the serial .  br    br   the acting is wooden   the sets are cheap   the dialogue is horrendous and if there was even a script they were following i  m sure it read along the lines of  batman says something here  because it certainly seems like they  re making it up as it goes along .  br    br   batman  s utility belt is made out of thin fabric with no apparent pouches to hold his gadgets   in one scene when batman needs a full size blow torch the producers just tuck one in as the scene starts   never to be seen again . his cowl is so bad he can  t even see out of it and his ears look more like flopsy mopsy the disgruntled easter rabbit than they do anything batlike .  br    br   in one scene  i am not making this up   batman substitutes counterfiet radioactive money that will burst into flames the second it is exposed to air as a payoff to some hoods . it  s radioactive so he can trace it   the reason it  s so highly flammable isn  t explained . well  unfortunately the thugs open the package in a cardboard warehouse   we know it  s a cardboard warehouse because batman sneaks in and pushes these boxes that look to weigh about six ounces on the hoods to knock them out   and soon the whole place burns to the ground . thanks batman   br    br   in another scene after the batmobile is disabled  batman flags down a passing motorist in the middle of nowhere and takes his car   leaving the man to fend for himself and telling him not to worry because if batman smashes up the car the police will surely buy him another one  yes  you guessed it  said car careens off a cliff within a few short seconds . not that it matters much to the motorist who has probably died from exposure trying to hoof his way back to gotham city .  br    br   there is a tired subplot with lois lane clone vicki vale who is convinced bruce wayne is batman   she must have noticed the batmobile parked outside of bruce  s house   or maybe she saw batman and robin running up the walk in the clearly densely populated suburban neighborhood .  br    br   everything about this serial is bad   and all but the youngest in the audience will want to hurl toast at the screen . if you  re looking for bad cinema you could not hit a better mark   if you want entertainment  try the burton batman films  the adam west batman tv series or the earlier lewis wilson batman serial .  ,0
  fever pitch  isn  t a bad film it  s a terrible film .  br    br   is it possible american movie audiences and critics are so numbed and lobotomized by the excrement that hollywood churns out that they  ll praise to the skies even a mediocre film with barely any laughs  that  s the only reason i can think of why this horrible romantic comedy  and i use that term loosely because there  s nothing funny in this film  is getting good reviews .  br    br   i sat through this film stunned that screenwriters lowell ganz and babaloo mandel would even for an instant think their script was funny .  br    br   the brilliant nick hornby usually translates well to film . he adapted  fever pitch  for a british film starring colin firth and ruth gemmell in      peter hedges found hornby  s voice for  about a boy        and when  high fidelity  was americanized for a movie in      writers d . v . devincentis  steve pink  john cusack and scott rosenberg didn  t go wrong because they kept the essence of hornby  s wit and humor . they made one of the best films of that year .  br    br   so why does the american version of  fever pitch  go so painfully awry  the british version wasn  t a masterpiece  but it was charming  funny  unexpected and gave us two characters we could like  respect and understand .  br    br   but ganz and mandel have excised everything funny in hornby  s work . in americanizing the story  they  ve butchered it  removing all that was good and unique about hornby  s work and replacing it with conventional drivel .  br    br   they  ve transformed a funny story into a formulaic romantic comedy  never once veering from the wretched formula . lindsey  drew barrymore  has three girlfriends  each of whom has a distinct function . one  s overweight  the second  s cynical and ambitious  and the third  s a romantic . want to guess how many male friends ben  jimmy fallon  has   br    br   what made  high fidelity  such fun was not only a good leading man and lady  but engaging supporting characters . in this  fever pitch   the six supporting friends do or say nothing especially funny . they  re so insignificant  they  re not even decorative . the only reason they  re in the film is because the formula demands it . poor ione skye winds up as one lindsey  s pals in a thankless role . the lovely skye must have been wishing lloyd dobler would swoop in and take her away . come to think of it  cusack would  ve made an excellent ben . of course  cusack is too smart to attach himself to such an utterly tedious script .  br    br   there isn  t a single  solitary moment in this film that seems original or unforced . every plot turn is predictable  every lame joke telegraphed . ganz and mandel labor for laughs . the first   minutes are so excruciatingly slow  you wonder if these chaps realized they were writing a comedy . you can mark the plot turns in this film by your watch . it  s almost as if ganz and mandel penned this with some screen writing guru  s formula pasted on the wall . when they got to a certain page  they looked up at the formula and said   ok  the guru says this has to happen now .  and  presto   br    br   directors bobby and peter farrelly don  t help the film any . they have no concept how to introduce their story and characters  they hand over the v . o . narration not to the protagonist  but to another guy who sits behind ben at fenway park  . thanks to some extremely clunky writing  we have to watch barrymore and fallon stumble through their unfunny initial meetings .  br    br   barrymore does cute and adorable better than most . she  s as good at it as goldie hawn in her heyday . but even her cuteness can  t save this extraordinarily awful film . she tries hard to wring some energy and humor out of this story . about   minutes into the film  lindsey tells ben   you  re funny .  the only explanation for her remark is that it was in the script . for fallon  s ben never says anything even remotely funny . fallon is neither witty nor funny when he does comedy  he overacts .  br    br   fallon was never any good on  saturday night live .  he was quite possibly the least funny person on that show . remember that lame sketch about a radio dj who did all the voices  the only reason  weekend update  worked occasionally was because fallon  s cohort  tina fey  knows a thing or two about comedy .  br    br   actors who think they  re funny and behave that way rarely  if ever  are actually funny . that  s true of fallon . he thinks he  s hysterically funny when he barely raises a chuckle . his stuttering  unsure  of  himself shtick didn  t work on the small screen it  s lousier on the big screen .  br    br   unfortunately for fallon  his role in this picture also requires a few dramatic moments . if you thought his comedy was bad  wait till you get a load of his dramatic stuff . two scenes in particular  the first in a park  the second in front of ben  s school  are painful to watch . the scenes require an actor with a smidgen of dramatic ability  but fallon has neither the knowledge nor the ability to make them work . his range of emotions doesn  t even run the gamut from a to b .  br    br   ben has no personality or depth . often  he comes across as an oaf . and not a lovable one at that . it boggles the mind what lindsey would find attractive about him . compare fallon  s performance to firth  s in the british version  and you  ll understand how terribly flat  unfunny and forced fallon  s ben is and how wrong he is for this role . watching fallon in  fever pitch  makes one long for the dramatic depth and comedic nuance of ashton kutcher   br    br   just as  high fidelity  did  an americanized  fever pitch  could  ve worked brilliantly . it just needed better writers  more competent directors and  most definitely  a stronger  funnier  smarter leading man . do yourself a huge favor avoid this rotten film rent the     british version and read hornby  s book  instead .  ,0
cavemen was by far the biggest load of crap i have ever wasted my time watching . this show based on the geico commercials is less entertaining then an actual   sec ad for geico . the makeup was half ass  ed to say the least  hard to imagine a caveman with prefect white teeth even after going to the dentist . this show could of had potential for a funny series if they could of gotten the cast from the commercials  that in it self makes for a lousy show . perhaps if the writers were the same from the geico ads this may of had a chance  instead the pilot lacked a good story line . i give this show a  out of    i would of liked to put a zero out of   but that was not an option . i pray for a quick death to this show  i  d give it less then  episodes before it dies a deserving death .  ,0
i watched this movie after watching practical magic  and the older film was far superior . i liked the way the lighting  makeup  and costumes changed as gillian changed in the story . jimmy stewart  s mannerisms didn  t do a lot for me in this film  but i suppose they did serve to highlight the reserve of gillian  s character . i was also struck by nicky  s and gillian  s mannerisms   it was as if the director wanted him to appear effeminate and gillian to appear masculine . the gestures nicky makes when he  s showing redlich his powers especially struck me . i  ve never thought of warlocks as being effeminate  so it was an interesting way of contrasting those characters .  ,1
this film is really cool . every thing looks like it came out of the comic book . the sets  the costumes  and the plot is great . clark bartram is again our favorite batman . he looked a bit better in dead end  but he still pulls it off . superman is great too . the flying effects are ok . but its a fan  film so we cant expect them to be the greatest . the shot with superman catching the car was very believable . it was cool . this is a movie i would definitely see if it were real . its got every thing you would want in a batman  superman movie . one exception though  i would cast the joker instead of   face . . . . . overall i give this film a   because its a great film .  ,1
this movie was different in that it didn  t show the typical gay stereotypes that i  m used to seeing . but that doesn  t change the fact that it totally lacks a storyline . i  m sure that there are many gay men who are just happy to see themselves depicted on screen  since black gay characters are seldom seen  and when they are the characters are usually not fully developed . but  how hard would it have been for the writer to actually script a story with a beginning  middle and end . or how about a story that was focused . there really doesn  t seem to be a point to this film  and even though it is a low budget film  that is still no excuse for the lack of story or plot .  ,0
in the recent movement to bring asian films over to america  this is the last movie that should be released here . being a big fan of asian movies from all genres  i was browsing the net and came across this soong to be re  released into the us market so i decided to check it out ahead of time and rent this at a local video store .  br    br   trust me . . . the action scenes are incredibly disappointing  crouching tiger and iron monkey completely blew this movie out of the water . jet li would fall asleep watching the fighting sequences . if you  re looking for martial arts entertainment  your time would be better off with a jackie chan flick     br    br   moreover . . . you think you  re going to watch a martial arts with about a girl engulfed in vengence for her parents death but surprise    a good hour of this movie in the middle has is filled with dialogue  an absense of action  the lack of devloping a tangent plot  pretty much nothing to do with the premise we are exposed to . it has more to do with the relationship between her and the boy  and the boy with his conspiracy group in which the producer  director dedicated no time in elbaorating  and yet dedicated a portion of the film dragging the issue . would of been much better off if they had just cut that whole hour and developed the story in itself through another film and focus on the martial arts aspect .  br    br   speaking of which  i really don  t believe the choreographer of iron monkey  did the action sequence in princess blade . i was completely insulted in the frequent usage of slow motion and quick camera changes to portray the assassins physical swiftness . i just didn  t buy it .  br    br   please . . . i  m warning you to please do not waste your time  money with this movie . the premise is intrigueing  and the trailer might even tempt you but i am positive that this movie is not suited for the public  maybe in japan but not in the states  and will be the worst film brought over to the states from the asian film industry .  ,0
this movie  even though it is over   years old is still a very moving  strong film . bette davis  as the slutty  vicious cockney waitress mildred is absolutely believable . watching her performance is still spellbinding . she makes the viewer absolutely despise her and pity her at the same time . leslie howard  s performance as the weak  obsessed phillip carey is not as strong  but i don  t see how any actor could hold their own against ms . davis  s performance . she chews up the scenery in every scene she is in  totally stealing the show . this is the movie that sealed her stardom and she deserved to win the academy award  but lost . it was shocking for it  s day what with themes of unwed pregnancy  multiple sex partners  and mildred  s vicious language so it is somewhat dated  but still an excellent movie . just to see the scene where mildred tells phillip what she really thinks of him   you cad  you dirty swine . . . .   is still some of the greatest acting i have ever seen on film .  ,1
in the mid      s hollywood was regaining its confidence after the difficulties of the talkie transition . although all the technical problems of sound had been solved very quickly  it took longer to resolve the questions of how talking pictures should look  how they should be structured and how they should be acted . the informer is a key picture in that it shows the extent to which wordless moments can convey story  asserting the power images without ignoring the necessities of sound and dialogue .  br    br   this is not to say the informer is truly a throwback to the golden days of the silents . for one thing  many silent pictures were not so purely visual in their narrative  and were overburdened with title cards . but what the informer has is the self  assuredness to extend moments between dialogues  to focus on reactions more than speeches  and to let shots play out simply for atmosphere .  br    br   director john ford  for all his capability  was a filmmaker who appears to have put in effort in proportion to how interested he was in the material . if he thought a story was silly  he just did it half  arsed . luckily the informer  with its depiction of community  honour  working class life and most importantly irish setting  was everything ford loved  and the result is one of his finest works . in it  ford only really employs too kinds of shot . the first is of places  the dublin streets shrouded in mist and darkness so their furthest depths cannot be seen dingy interiors where the walls and ceilings seem to press in on us . the second is of faces  striking close  ups against plain backgrounds  usually without dialogue  focusing us upon the inner conflicts of these people .  br    br   lead man victor mclaglen fits perfectly within this character and this manner of filming him . mclaglen  s performance does not look like much  being as it is about    drunk act . but the other    is heartfelt emoting  as here and there his gypo nolan has what alcoholics refer to as a moment of clarity . with such performances are oscars won . mclaglen is backed by a spot  on supporting cast  among whom there are no weak links . in particular it is nice to have donald meek and una o  connor  usually only seen in comic relief roles  playing straight dramatic parts for once  although meek  s appearance does contain one or two jokes  the tone of the scene and much of his manner is serious  . not only do these two deliver incredibly deep performances  their familiarity to most viewers as comedy players gives an added note of poignancy to their part in this tragedy .  br    br   rko  who produced the informer  were perhaps the most adventurous and willing to take risks of all the major studios . thanks to this  we are able to see a dismal story with a despicable anti  hero at its centre  which could easily have been a clunky  over  earnest mess  instead filled with a moody atmosphere and depth of character which keeps us watching and draws us into its world .  ,1
the fourth of five westerns anthony mann did with james stewart  this one involves a hard bitten cattleman named jeff webster who takes a cattle drive from wyoming to alaska  via seattle . he hooks up in seattle with his partners ben tatum  walter brennan  and rube morris  jay c . flippen  that he has sent ahead of time in order to make preparations for the boat trip  north .  br    br   but first  he has to put up with insubordinate trail hands  cheating riverboat captains and the charms of coy  manipulative ronda castle  ruth roman  who believes jeff could be a valuable ally in the future . that  s why she hides him out on the boat while the captain  s looking for him for the earlier  and justifiable  killing of a trail hand .  br    br   jeff also has the misfortune of running into sleazy judge gannon  john mcintire  who runs the town of skagway  alaska . gannon locks jeff up for disrupting his public hanging by running his cattle through town . he fines jeff the ownership of his cattle and jeff just has to eat crow for the time being .  br    br   in the meantime  jeff agrees to ride point for ronda up to dawson in order to deliver supplies . but this is just a ruse so jeff  ben and rube can slip back into skagway and steal his cattle back . of course judge gannon finds out about this and is right behind but is delayed by jeff with a rifle while ben races the cattle over the canadian border out of gannon  s reach .  br    br   after avoiding an avalanche and another shootout with some other skagway men  they finally reach dawson where jeff sells his cattle to the highest bidder  which just happens to be ronda who then promptly sets up a new gambling house in dawson . jeff then takes his money and buys himself a claim and starts panning for gold .  br    br   but then judge gannon comes up to dawson to get in on the gold action up there  and tells jeff that he was getting a little bored with skagway and wants to try his luck up in the klondike  himself . that involves bring some hired gunman with him and forcibly stealing some of the other miner  s claims . jeff and ben now feel it  s time to clear out while the goings are good  leaving rube to fend for himself as a most ineffective sheriff against gannon and his gang .  br    br   they look for a back way out only to find themselves ambushed by gannon  s men because ben made the mistake of opening his big mouth . ben is killed and jeff is severely wounded but that doesn  t save judge gannon from his just due . the ending shootout at night on the muddy dawson street pretty much takes care of that . first jeff kills two of gannon  s best gunman  jack elam and robert wilkie  . then as ronda comes out to warn jeff that gannon is trying to slip around behind him  gannon shoots her in the back and she dies right there in jeff  s arms . then jeff kills gannon as he  s hiding under a wooden sidewalk . revenge has spoken .  br    br   this is another rip  roaring western that  s right up there with the naked spur and the man from laramie . why the universal dvd uses a pan  and  scan print instead of the widescreen print tcm uses  is beyond me . you  ll wind up missing half the glorious alberta cinematography by william daniels . so if you like well  written   s westerns  then this one  s an a  list keeper .  br    br    out of    ,1
standard  paint  by  numbers  monster fare  filled with a bunch of routine plot devices from big  creature movies . it  s like somebody had a deck of cards with plot ideas from other movies written on them  which were shuffled  and dealt . whatever plot lines and characters came up in the deal were then tossed into the script .  br    br   characters are so clich  ridden  that you can play a game of  guess who ends up as a monster meal  after less than ten minutes into the movie  and probably get every single one right   including the order that they will get devoured . many of the characters are so obnoxious  that you root for the creature to shut them up . some of the main characters include a billy idol clone who surfs with sharks  a loudmouth brat who flashes bankrolls  a capt . ahab guy with a vendetta  and ahab  s girlfriend who does sleazy dances at a bar . oh  and a big  big beast in need of anger management therapy .  br    br   along the way  people argue a lot  pretty girls run around with wet t  shirts  couples make out on exotic beaches  explosions occur  ruins of a shrine appear  and greasy  faced pirates drop by .  br    br   amusing  for the most part  but one thing bothered me the callousness by characters when other people were killed . after one violent demise  they make one  liner jokes . i could almost hear rim shots .  br    br   overall  ok  if you have   minutes to waste  and you want to laugh at a so  bad  it  s  good  movie . otherwise  you may want to skip this one .  ,0
great cgi effects  a truly oscar  worthy performance by gary sinise as lt . dan .  br    br   tom hanks is a one  trick pony in this movie  how he got the best actor oscar that year over morgan freeman was a crime .  br    br   this movie is a pandering treacly love letter to the baby boom generation  with a barely concealed right  wing prejudice  beginning from forrest  s service in vietnam all the way through to the  resolution  with jenny at the end .  br    br   with that said  though  it is hugely entertaining and an american movie through and through . i found certain parts of this film exceedingly offensive  zemeckis dumbs down this movie almost to the level of gump himself . . . maybe that was the point he was trying to make .  br    br   watch this film and ask yourself  what is robert zemeckis saying about what makes a good american    br    br   forrest seems to have made the  right  choices and been at the  right place at the right time  for the last   years . those who are wrong according to the director  s vision seem to pay a heavy price . so is zemeckis saying that idiocy disguised as innocence and naivety is a patriotic  even american quality   ,0
this is a gem  a real piece of americana for all that this implies . if you are self programed to resist  life  afirming  stories  just stay away and leave the pleasure to the rest of us who still believe . and what makes the frosting on the cake truly delectable is that it is fact based on a real rags to riches story  no need to nit  pick what details were changed to make a compact story . chris cooper is one of the greatest living actors  and the complex  self  conflicted  bottom  line good at the core father he portrayed could only be pulled off successfully by someone with his skill and insight . the simple minded comments  refusing to accept a father who tries to lay down the law all the while sensing that he may possibly be off  track  expose the limitation of the commentator  not the writers or the acting . this is not for the cynical  or the simple minded .  ,1

the last wave is never going to win over the mainstream audience . it is a slow  moving but fascinating film for those who are willing to go along with it . an australian properties lawyer is asked to take on the case of five aborigines accused in the murder of one of their own . all sorts of portents and omens soon pop up  as the man  s death involves a tribal issue that was not meant for white man  s court  and pretty soon the lawyer is having trouble distinguishing reality from fantasy . it looks like the end of the world may be at hand  and he and the aborigines may know this but no one else does . richard chamberlain as the lawyer is at his peak here . david guptil  a familiar face from several other australian flicks and a decent actor  is one of the five aborigines on trial . the last wave is simply not for everyone  anymore than is magnolia  both happen to have strange things falling from the sky  . check it out on a slow saturday night .  ,1

i had quite high hopes for this film  even though it got a bad review in the paper . i was extremely tolerant  and sat through the entire film . i felt quite sick by the end .  br    br   although i am not in the least prude or particularly sensitive to tasteless cinema   i thouroughly enjoyed both woody allen  s  everything you ever wanted to know about sex  . . .  and michael hanneke  s  funny games    i found the directors  obsession with this ten  year  old wanting to drink women  s milk totally sickening . and when the film climaxed in an  orgy  where the boy drinks both his mother  s milk  as well as that of the woman he has been lusting after for the whole film  i almost vomited with disgust for the total perversion and sentimental pap that it is .  br    br   don  t get me wrong  i enjoy the vast majority of european cinema  as well as independently made films  so this flick should have pleased me enormously . avoid this film at all costs  it should be relegated to the annals of history as a lesson in bad cinema .  ,0
even by     standards of movie  making the setup which her cardboard lover presents was dated to the extreme . the machinations of one half of a pair  of husband  wife  ex  husband  ex  wife  to get the other back at the threat of marriage to another  divorce  or an eventual separation by means of jealousy  humiliation  or other schemes had been done much better in classics such as his girl friday and the philadelphia story . both of these movies features women with a strong  indomitable screen presence and who played independent  proto  feminist characters . in both movies  both women were estranged  divorced from their  witty  first husbands and set to marry colorless men who were their exact opposite  and both would be bamboozled into rejecting their soon  to  be husbands and re  igniting their passion for each other .  br    br   the plot in her cardboard lover switches the gender here  it  s norma shearer in the cary grant role out  this time  to ward off an ex  boyfriend  george sanders  by means of hiring robert taylor to pose as her gigolo . the problem is  shearer is much too old to be playing a role more suited to an actress in her mid  to  late twenties sanders is about as involved as a piece of furniture for the most   any man who would be in love with his fiance  on seeing a strange man come out of her bathroom as happens here  would knock the lights out of him and cause a huge scene . not here . and robert taylor plays his part as if he were trying to channel cary grant half the time  not in speech inflections but in overall essence .  br    br   but the worst part of it is shearer herself . for an actress used to parts which gave her a sense of intellectual sexiness and dramatic presence  playing consuelo craydon seems to put her into throes of complete over  acting  over  emoting  and over  gesturing which  while still a part of her style of acting and more appropriate ten years earlier  makes her look like an extremely mannered performer wrenching the joke out of a situation like water from a fairly dry sponge . it only fuels the fires that tell the theory which gives irving thalberg the maker of her career and chooser of  most of her  roles why she passed on roles such as charlotte vale and mrs . miniver on mega  hits now voyager and mrs . miniver is a mystery  but then again  most accounts also state that by this time she had just burnt out from acting  that she  d had lost interest in the whole thing altogether and it  s no secret that anyone who has experienced this sort of thing has essentially lost focus and can  t wait until retirement or the end of a contract is near to leave as soon as possible . such could be the case here . she seems lost  she seems tired  she seems ill at ease  going through autopilot instead of living the part . after this film she would make no more  but would be responsible of discovering janet leigh who would come into her own as a screen star during the late   s and into the   s .  ,0
i  m sitting here nov     and i still can  t help rave about this movie . arnold  s best movies came in about a    year span . running man  predator  and total recall       . all  are amazing . the cheesy one liners by arnold in this movie will make you laugh on more than one occasion . i find the acting in this movie surprisingly good as was the case in predator and totall recall . they did a great job in trying to make the scenes futuristic as it is supposed to take place in      but you can  t help but snicker at the    s style haircuts on the men and woman in the crowd and the normal television monitors in the running man studio which we all know here in     are on the way out with the emergence of flat panel and hdtv  s . also the computer graphics of the  the running man  game show intro would not look like that in     . nevertheless the storyline is absolutely fantastic . not once during this movie did i want to get up and not care about the ending which is something i do often with today  s movie  s . i really think that arnold  s acting is much better than he  s given credit for . now i would not have elected him governor but that  s california for you . buzzsaw  dynamo  fireball  subzero are fantastic  stalkers  as well and i find the producers don  t try to overkill the fight scenes . when the stalker is dead . . . he  s dead . it doesn  t go on for   minutes each . the stalker scenes are quick and entertaining but they don  t try and overplay it . i give this movie a      and that  s coming from someone who doesn  t enjoy a lot of movies these days . if you get the right actors and the right story then the futuristic graphical displays that you  d see in     are not important or necessary .  ,1
ok hollywood is not liberal .  br    br   obviously i  m lieing because it is . im a conservative but the politics i will leave out of my opinion of the movie . this movie was anti bush  anti middle east  anti big oil propaganda but that is not why it was bad .  br    br   fist off i will give credit where credit is due . i saw this film opening night because i happen to like these kinds of films and am a political science major in collage . the cinematography was excellent and the acting was as far as i could tell very good .  br    br   the plot was impossible for me to decode however . i have been tested and have an iq of    but no matter how hard i tried there was no way i could piece together the story line of the movie and what characters where doing what .  br    br   the story and scene sequence was totally incoherent and poorly organized .  br    br   unless this is one of those movies that is meant to be watch many times to get the full depth pf the story  which it very well may be  i have no idea exactly what was going on .  br    br   which makes sense because if you want to make a political argument and not receive any criticism then make your argument impossible to critique  if you cant dazzle them with brilliance  then baffle them with bull s .  ,0
a cast of      s tv movie and tv series guest stars  misty rowe  pamela hemsley  clevon little  seymour cassel among several others  in the story of a photographer who has dreams about killing his models . of course the models and other people start turning up dead causing all sorts of complications .  br    br   over done not very good thriller has enough nudity and violence to get an r rating but not enough good material to engender any real interest . this is best described as the sort of movie that gave the cable channel cinemax the alternate name of skinamax . i really can  t see the point of watching this unless you need to see every sleazy thriller out there .  i also have to comment that this film is filled with smoking  to the point that it becomes laughable when anyone lights up   ,0
i have to say that sometimes  looks  are all that matters  just like jeremy clarkson from bbc has pointed out  not about our earth though  but he is right anyway  .  br    br   and when it comes to looks  this movie is such an unbelievably stunning beauty you will absolutely love what your eyes are about to see .  br    br   and then there  s the personality of the movie as well  interesting  with a captivating narrator voice and narrator stories that will touch your soul as you watch those superbly filmed images .  br    br   the movie probably won  t affect your lifestyle  ruining these beauties  but it will certainly remember you how precious our earth we live on truly is .  br    br   this movie deserves it  s   stars as it is one of the few stylistic earth documentaries i truly enjoyed .  ,1
i am probably one of the few viewers who would not recommend this film . thought visually stunning like all of ang lee  s work  each still frame seems worthy of a print   i was really disappointed by the film  s disjointed pace . it really was too long .  br    br   the story is set in civil war era missouri  and is about a young man  roedel  who joins the feral forces of the bushwackers  sort of renegade confederate sympathizers who conduct geurilla type fighting with the jayhawkers  their union counterparts . he and his close friend  jack bull chiles played by skeet ulrich  join the group after chile  s father is shot point  blank and his home is burned  presumably by jayhawkers . the story follows roedel  s and chiles  raiding adventures and their interactions with other victims of the war  including former slave who fights for the bushwhackers  daniel holt played by jeffery wright   and a war widow played by jewel .  br    br   it seemed that every time the film developed the story to an interesting point  it would turn to some other subplot and leave things undeveloped . for example  the agitation among roedel  s group caused by former slave holt participating in the confederate cause is shown briefly through some conflict regarding propriety and protocol  and then dropped until later in the movie . a young villian  bully bushwhacker hates roedel and directs much angst and violence against him  but  we never know why . some of the characters never seem to surface i think that is because the movie embraces too many of them as well as taking on large amounts of history .  br    br   the historical detail was excellent . i loved looking at the housing  furniture  clothes  etc .  and i thought the lead actors did a wonderful job of humanizing the characters  though they stumbled a bit with the dialog . unless you really enjoy history or are a huge ang lee fan  though  take a pass on this one .  ,0
i was electrified when i first saw this in     or     . steven biko is gone half way through the film but the resonance of his courage and wisdom is not forgotten . i didn  t when finally in south africa in     . it is also largely a story about friendship and loyalty . when i was in south africa and heard the audience at a dance recital in natal sing nkosi sikelel  iafrika  my hair stood on its ends . there is a lot to learn from this story for all peoples .  ,1
when i first saw the preview for this movie  i really couldn  t wait to see it . the plot seemed good and the setting was great . i mean  a slasher movie that takes place on prom night  great idea   and the plot a high school teacher that becomes sexually obsessed with one of his students  goes crazy  gets arrested  and escapes three years later on prom night  prom night  a night that is supposed to be happy and memorable  turns into hell   however  i saw it and was extremely disappointed . it was not only the worst  horror movie  i have ever seen  but it was one of the worst movie in general that i have ever seen   first of all  it wasn  t even scary . there was not one moment in that movie when i jumped out of my seat . also  the murder scenes were so cheesy and dull . all the slasher did was either stab his victims in the stomach multiple times or cut their throats . also there was absolutely no gore  its rated pg     . the scene with the most blood was probably the one where the killer murders the black girl . he slits her throat and blood splatters on the sheets hanging around them  they don  t actually show him cutting her throat  .  br    br   next  you see the killers face the first time he is introduced in the movie . he isn  t mysterious  creepy  or scary . he  s just this guy who kills people .  br    br   also  everything in the movie was so clich . an example is when  at the end  the killer is about to kill the main character and at the last moment  the detective shoots and kills him . also  every single thing in this movie was so predictable . the victim  after seeing the guy with a knife  runs for her life  hides  thinks she gets away  and then the killer just pops out and kills her .  br    br   finally  the sequence of the movie was extremely bad . the guy goes into the hotel  kills a few people  the bodies are discovered  someone pulls the fire alarm  and everyone evacuates . the main character forgets something in her room  has an encounter with the killer  runs and escapes . thats it  she and her boyfriend go home  the slasher kills the guards patrolling the house  finds the girl  then gets killed by the detective . the movie sequence was so stupid and clich .  br    br   if your thinking of seeing this movie all because the preview looked good  trust me  don  t waste your time or money . no wonder this movie was being shown in the smallest theater in the movie theater . my friend and i  along with these two girls sitting in the back  were the only ones in the theater . that should have told me something about the movie beforehand .  ,0
this is probably one of the most original love stories i have seen for ages  especially for a war based  briefly  film . basically it is a story based in two worlds  one obviously real  the other fictitious but the filmmakers say at the beginning that it is only coincidence if it is a real place . anyway  peter carter  the great david niven  was going to crash in a plane  he talked to june  planet of the apes  kim hunter  before he bailed out and said he loved her . he was meant to die from jumping without a parachute  but somehow he survived  and now he is seeing and loving june in the flesh . this other place  like a heaven  is unhappy because he survived and was meant to come to their world  so they send french conductor    marius goring  to persuade him to go  but he is obviously in love . peter suggests to him that he should appeal to keep his life to the other world  s court  he is granted this . obviously love prevails when the two lovers announce that they would die for each other  june even offers to take his place  also starring robert coote as bob trubshawe  kathleen byron as an angel  a brief  then unknown  lord sir richard attenborough as an english pilot and abraham sofaer as the judge  the surgeon . david niven was number   on the   greatest british actors  the film was number   on the    greatest tearjerkers for the happy ending  it was number   on the    greatest war films  it was number   on the   greatest british films  and it was number   on the    greatest films . outstanding   ,1
every great gangster movie has under  currents of human drama . don  t expect an emotional story of guilt  retribution and despair from  scarface  . this is a tale of ferocious greed  corruption  and power . the darker side of the fabled  american dream  .  br    br   anybody complaining about the  cheesiness  of this film is missing the point . the superficial characters  cheesy music  and dated fashions further fuel the criticism of this life of diabolical excess . nothing in the lives of these characters really matter  not on any human level at least . in fact the film practically borderlines satire  ironic considering all the gangsta rappers that were positively inspired by the lifestyle of tony montana .  br    br   this isn  t brian depalma  s strongest directorial effort  it is occasionally excellent and well  handled  particularly the memorable finale   but frequently sinks to sloppy and misled . thankfully  it is supported by a very strong script by oliver stone  probably good therapy for him  considering the coke habit he was tackling at the time  . the themes are consistent  with the focus primarily on the life of tony montana  and the evolution of his character as he is consumed by greed and power . the dialogue is also excellent  see  sawing comfortably between humour and drama . there are many stand  out lines  which have since wormed their way into popular culture in one form or another .  br    br   the cast help make it what it is as well  but this is really pacino  s film . one of his earlier less subtle performances  something much more common from him nowadays   this is a world entirely separate from michael corleone and frank serpico . yet he is as watchable here as ever  in very entertaining  and intentionally over  the  top  form . it is hard to imagine another tony montana after seeing this film  in possibly one of the most mimicked performances ever . pfeiffer stood out as dull and uncomfortable on first viewing  but i  ve come to realize how she plays out the part of the bored little wife . not an exceptional effort  but unfairly misjudged . the supporting players are very good too  particularly paul shenar as the suave alejandro sosa .  br    br   powerful  occasionally humorous  sometimes shocking  and continually controversial .  scarface  is one of the films of the eighties  whatever that might mean to you  . an essential and accessible gangster flick  and a pop  culture landmark .      ,1
this film seems to be well remembered as the time tom  jerry signed a peace treaty . things are idyllic for a time but  predictably  it goes sour . probably the most memorable moment was the endless fight involving a pipe  a frying pan  and a baseball bat that the two plus butch the dog engage in at the beginning and end of the short . i enjoyed one a bunch and you should try to catch it on cartoon network .  ,1
this movie made me feel as if i had missed some important scenes from the very beginning . there were continuity errors and plots that stopped as abruptly as they started . i was very disappointed because i love whoopi goldberg  danny glover  in addition to that have always trusted  respected danny glovers taste in his choice of roles   grand canyon  for example . i just could not finish this movie  after what seemed an eternity  but was probably just a little over an hour we had to turn it off . there was no comedy  there was nothing about the characters to make you empathize or sympathize with them  there was no evoking of emotion at all regarding this movie and the clips of their past were poorly edited  confusing  and unnecessary . what could have been a great idea for a movie  even as a drama  not a comedy  although i think a comedy in this situation would have been better  because i love to watch white people freak out  start acting like complete idiots  it makes me laugh  became a waste of my   credit at the video store .  ,0
as it is generally known  anthology films don  t fare very well with american audiences  i guess they prefer one standard plot line  . new york  i love you  is the second phase of a series of anthology films dealing with cities  the people who live  love in them . the first was  paris  j  taime   which i really enjoyed . the film was made up of several segments  each written and  or directed by a different director  most of which were french  but there is a very funny segment directed by joel  ethan coen  . like  paris   this one is also an anthology  directed by several different directors  fatih akin  mira nair  natalie portman  shakher kapur  etc .   and also like  paris  deals with new yorkers  and why they love the city they live in . it features a top notch cast  featuring the likes of natalie portman  shia labeouf  christina ricci  orlando bloom  ethan hawki  and also features such seasoned veterans as james caan  cloris leachman  eli wallach and julie christie . some of the stories really fly  and others don  t  although i suppose it will depend on individual tastes    i won  t ruin it for anybody else by revealing which ones worked for me  which ones didn  t  . word is that the next entry in the series will be shanghai  china  is rome  italy  berlin  germany or athens  greece out of the question   . spoken mainly in english  but does have bits of yiddish  russian with english subtitles . rated  r  by the mpaa for strong language  sexual content  ,1
   the   year old virgin    made me laugh a lot . i don  t care if it is considered to be a very sexual comedy  i just enjoyed many of the jokes and scenes present in this movie . steve carell is perfect as the virgin nerd andy stitzer and i think the scene where andy has his chest hair removed by wax one of the coolest  specially because it is real . many of the actors and actresses present in this movie are well known or already famous  by the way .  br    br   andy stitzer has a peaceful life . he is a little bit strange and collects lots of toys  but seems harmless . one day  while playing poker with his friends of his work  they discover that andy is in fact . . . virgin  and he is already   years old  after this surprising revelation  all his friends are trying to make andy sleep with a woman . . . the problem is the confusions in which andy gets in  specially now that he is really starting to like trish  a woman he met when she was buying a dvd player in the store he works at .  ,1
i saw this movie only after hearing raves about it for years . needless to say  the actual experience proved a bit anticlimactic . but still  alec guiness energetically leads a wonderful cast in a jolly  if formulaic  romp through industrial post  wwii england .  br    br   this is the familiar tale of the woes of inventing the perfect everyday product . remember the car that runs on water  remember the promise of nuclear energy  in this case  it  s a fabric that doesn  t wear out  wrinkle  or even get dirty  of course  fabric manufacturers and their workers are horrified at the prospect of being put out of business  and so the plot gets a bit thick .  br    br   guiness makes the whole enterprise worthwhile  and watching him blow up a factory research lab over and over again is quite a blast   those brits . . . always the stiff upper lip when under fire .  the film might chug along exactly like guiness  s goofy invention  but it  s a good ride all the same .  ,1
i  m going to review the  films as a whole because i feel that is how it should be considered  and watched . when i talk about  the film  i am talking about parts    together when watched one after the other  as they should be .  br    br   thank you jon anderson  steven soderbergh  benicio del toro .  br    br   this film is a refreshing  bold  gritty and true film . and  it hearkens a new style of film making . no faux drama . no swelling sound track . not faux documentary style . just clean shots and an attempt to stick to the facts . i have been reading jon anderson  s  che guevara a revolutionary life  and recently finished fidel  s auto biography  and this had helped my ability to soak this film in properly . but i have to say that it is jon anderson  s exhaustive  penultimate and wonderful biography that has given this film the proper historical back bone . anderson was consultant on this film  or these  films  . what makes this film a true thing is that it is clean . no swelling music or slow  motion photography to heighten drama  and even more importantly no fake documentary shaky camera . just square shots and straight forward shooting style . the type of camera used makes you feel right there in the jungle . benicio del toro should be given full honors for this  i never doubted him as che throughout the film . . . not once . he did a wonderful job and i will respect him for ever for this . some people complain that the film only deals with  slices of his life and not the whole . but i think this is one of the true beautiful aspects of this film it doesn  t try to be everything . it doesn  t try to  tell the story  . a person  s life is too multifaceted to try and tell in         or   hours . this is one of the subtle beauties of this film  it resists that temptation  and stays focused on the intent of letting us get a feel for che  his developing militaristic mind and the forces around him . it focuses on  slices of time the battle to over throw batista  che  s u . n . speech and the gorilla preparations in bolivia .  motorcycle diaries  already told his young man side  and i applaud s . soderbergh for focusing on other aspects instead . i keep referring to jon anderson  s book and the film stays true . the only weak link for me are the casting  not the performance  of matt damon . in a film so loaded with true to life performances  an american   matt damon  playing a bolivian is a clunky stretch  he does well  but after so much care in the casting  this was an over  site . small and completely forgiven . the reality that the rest of the casting gives you  and most notably benicio del toro  s amazing job  put  s this film at the top of my list .  br    br   the fact that this film went almost straight to video say  s something about how the cold war ethics that would never allow the  revolutionized cuba  to become what it might have  are still at work keeping it  s story quiet . if not out of clandestine muffling  then out of the effects of properly done propaganda that has prejudiced this topic .  br    br   this is a must see film  and jon anderson  s  che guevara a revolutionary life  is a must read if you want to start to get a grasp of the early effects on the global mind set regarding the expansion of international  political financial chess moves of the    s     s     s that placed unfair pressure on our south american neighbors  and the effects it fostered .  ,1
this film was a disaster from start to finish . interspersed with performances from  the next generation of beautiful losers  are interviews with bono and the edge as well as the performers themselves . this leaves little time for the clips of leonard cohen himself  who towers over everyone else in the film with his commanding yet gentle presence  wisdom and humor . the rest are too busy trying to canonize him as st . leonard or as some old testament prophet . many of the performances are forgettable over  interpretations  especially rufus  martha wainright  s  or bland under  achievements . only beth orton and anthony got within striking distance of leonard  s own versions by using a little restraint . annoying little pseudo  avant  garde gestures are sprinkled throughout the film  like out of focus superimpositions of red spheres over many of the concert and interview shots  shaky blurred camera work  use of digital delay on some of leonard cohen  s comments  making it harder to hear what  s being said  and a spooky  pretentious low drone under a lot of the interview segments  an attempt at added gravitas   . for the real thing  see the songs from the life of documentary produced by the bbc in     .  ,0
after having seen and loved postal  yes  i actually loved postal   i decided to try another uwe boll film and i picked out seed because i happened to stumble on it in a local dvd  store and it  s supposed to be one of his better films .  br    br   while the first   to   minutes of the film were very promising and seemed like the beginning of a not too mainstream psychological thriller  it soon went downhill from there and eventually degraded into one of the most generic slasher films i  ve seen so far  including a massive amount of plot holes  unrealistic emotional responses and sub  par acting . it seems like boll tried his best to come up with a decent plot but after a while just gave up on it . maybe he should stick to comedy   the few good things about this film is that he does manage to create an overall creepy atmosphere  that the special effects are better than i expected and the soundtrack does go well with the overall atmosphere  but the unbalanced pacing of this film combined with the utter generic nature thereof makes he last half hour quite tedious to watch  which ruined my experience altogether . there are a very fairly well done shocking scenes  but they seem to be there for the shock value alone . and let  s not forget the camera work that was pretty nauseating at times .  br    br   i hope uwe boll will one day learn what makes a good film  because between a lot of horrible films he does seem to make a decent film every now and then . seed just isn  t one of those .  ,0
the script for this movie was probably found in a hair  ball recently coughed up by a really old dog . mostly an amateur film with lame fx . for you zeta  jones fanatics she has the credibility of one mr . binks .  ,0
steve carpenter cannot make horror movies . first of all  the casting was very wrong for this movie . the only decent part was the hot brown haired girl from buffy the vampire slayer . this movies has no gore  usually a key ingredient to a horror movie   no action  no acting  and no suspense  also a key ingredient  . wes bentley is a good actor but he is so dry and plain in this that it  s sad . there were a few parts that were supposed to be funny  continuing the teen horror  comedy movies  and no one laughed in the audience . i thought that this movie was rated r  and i didn  t pay attention and realized it had been changed to pg    . anyway  see this movie if you liked i still know what you did last summer . that  s the only type of person who would find this movie even remotely scary . and seriously  this is to you steve carpenter  stop making horror movies . this movie makes scream look like texas chainsaw massacre .  ,0
origins of the care bears  their cousins . if you saw the original film you  ll notice a discrepancy . the cousins are raised with the care bears  rather than meeting them later . however i have no problems with that  preferring to treat the films as separate interpretations . the babies are adorable and it  s fun watching them play and grow . my favourite is swift heart rabbit . the villain is a delightfully menacing shapeshifter . i could empathise with the three children since i was never good at sports either . cree summer is excellent as christy . the songs are sweet and memorable . if you have an open heart  love the toys or enjoyed the original  this is not to be missed .      ,1
i really wish that when making a comedy  the people actually tried to make it funny . this is a film that you can sit through  but nothing is special about it . after watching it  you will say that it was alright . it was not boring to watch  but gave the audience no jokes to laugh at . entertainment should mean that you actually get something more than an o . k . story . this movie wanted to be  tootsie   but instead it failed .  br    br   i gave it a  out of   .  ,0
  the deadly look of love  is essentially  fatal attraction  with a couple of twists added onto the back half . the ending will not surprise anyone who has seen more than two or three movies of the week . it is yet another cautionary tale about succumbing to temptation  and it adds nothing fresh to the genre .  br    br   brett  vincent spano  is engaged to a beautiful woman who just happens to have a sizable trust fund . even though he has it all  he risks losing everything by starting up a steamy side affair with janet  jordan ladd  . janet  a doe  eyed blonde from cedar falls  falls hard for brett  and she does not take it particularly well when he comes clean about his engagement . shortly after the wedding  mrs . brett turns up dead in the master bedroom of the large  luxurious home she shared with her new husband . when the police question brett  he promptly points the finger at janet . following her arrest  janet seems to get loonier by the minute  not that she was the picture of stability before . her defense attorney  holland taylor  is convinced that janet is innocent and is hell bent on proving it .  br    br   did she do it or didn  t she  how will it end  you can find out the answers to these questions the next time  the deadly look of love  airs on your local station . and be sure not to miss the moral of this beautiful story men are pigs  and women are crazy .  ,0
this was recently on amc  s vibrant movie classics and i had to laugh . i had high hopes for this adventure that follows in the vein of  voyage to the earth  s core  and  mysterious island  . i was sorely disappointed not only in the acting credentials but in the silly story line that reads from a five year old  s comic book . be sure to catch sight of the wires that are holding on to the pterdactyl  s wings when they grasp  ogar  a half idiot pre  modern man who befriends the lost adventurers . the ending left it open for further rehashing of the same effects in  people that time forgot  . don  t waste your time .  ,0
film starts with  people meeting each other in the bar . ok . they  re talking about their imaginary lives  lying all the time  with no reason . still ok . from time to time  they even make you laugh . interesting . first   minutes you actually enjoy it  but then . . . things become worse . . . nothing  s happening . . . for a long time . . . and then  when something happen  all you can see are naked old  ladies  touching each other  not ok . disgusting  by the way  this part should be the top of the movie  but it  s everything except that  movie has no point  it  s boring  and sick   br    br   the strangest thing is that here  belgrade  serbia  on fest  film festival   this movie was the most popular according to researches  of course  before people watched it  i even thought  before watching    hay  this might be interesting  although it  s a russian movie   but  god  no      ,0
i  m a huge randolph scott fan  but this film is a dud . the whole thing has a canned  fake  soundstage feel to it  with truly awful rear  screen projection . it has a good plot idea that the screenwriter has successfully buried in a nitwit script  which makes it impossible for the audience to become immersed in the action and truly care about any of the characters . the directing is pedestrian  and only accentuates how bad the script is instead of helping to improve it . i  ve seen plenty of thoroughly enjoyable  soundstage productions  before  but this is not one of them . all it does is make you appreciate the gritty scott  boetticher films all the more .  br    br   randolph scott is tanned  trim  and shines that million dollar smile throughout . he  s always a pleasure . . . even in the worst of his films . aside from scott  the other main reason i wanted to see this movie was due to how much i enjoyed ms . wymore in errol flynn  s movie   rocky mountian  . in  man behind the gun   she is just as beautiful  and you can tell she  s a good actress  but she was forced to say some pretty dumb lines  and the blocking she was given by the director was truly awful . i  ve only seen phil carey in  operation pacific   and he plays the exact same character here . . . an arrogant pain  in  the  butt you want to beat into unconsciousness . i guess it proves he  s a good actor . . . he made me hate him . there are some lame attempts at comic relief that only detract from the film  in my opinion . although there are many elements to knock  i must say that i found myself truly enjoying the two spanish songs sung in the musical numbers . . . but that  s not why we go to see randolph scott movies  right   br    br   there are definitely worse scott films out there  and this one certainly isn  t unbearable  but it also certainly couldn  t be deemed anything beyond mediocre .  ,0
beautifully done . a lot of angst . friendship may not endure all  but in the end it  s all that matters  or so a group of friends learn . i have watched it over and over again . the music is also amazing . when kei loses the one friend he has he gives up until he meets sho  an orphan boy who is not repelled by his true nature . in the lawless streets of mallepa they struggle for their own place among a melting pot of asian races  and learn that sometimes being on top can cost you more than you are ever ready to pay . a surprise ending that grips as much as the whole movie does . i couldn  t get enough of it . gackt and hyde do a wonderful job of acting  proving they are more than pretty boys who sing .  ,1
the movie begins a with mentally  challenged girl with bright yellow sneakers looking skyward on a madrid street corner and being spellbound by a passing plane . the movie examines the life of five womenadela  leire  maricarmen  anita  isabelwho have completely different lives and choices of shoes . their shoes is the first superficial  yet affixed with some glancing meaning  clue we get at their fragile identities . in a theatrically embroidered and embellished way  a podiatrist tries to esoterically reveal the deepest secrets of a woman  s souls by the sole of her feet . the premise is risky and slightly contrived  but the tone and depth of the movie takes a daring plunge for the good .  br    br   what may have been light  hearted and superficial  quickly switches gear with the a superb dysfunctional couple scene that leaves the viewer riveted for minutes  seeing the love or lack thereof  the pain  the confusion  the hope  the needs and escape mechanisms develop through minutes different rooms of the house and down to the street and eventually below . . . what a scene     but there will be others as effective to follow and strengthen the strong characterization and directing displayed in this slice of life affair .  br    br   moving along  a woman has lost the husband she loved and inherited his kids and his taxi  while another has completely lost her husband emotionally  sexually  intellectually  but not physically . a ghost  a pending divorce reproach  regret  remorse . a new love  can you love a mirage  can you love the person in the mirror  can you love someone you can  t love  or think you can  t love  can you love and live life even though it will always be somewhat hopeless  yet isn  t it exactly these hopes and dreams that keep us here grounded and in a spectrum of relative happiness  a lot of deep themes emerge and the final act brings people and ideas together to coalesce in an existential crisis with no clear cut solution  definitive decision or effective healing . maybe a elusive thought  a fleeting feeling  but a lasting appreciation of life and of the artistry and intellect of the film . live . live again . rewind the reel . unveil the real  the important the big stones  piedras  of life . the rest is just details .  ,1
outrage is pretty good movie  robert culp was very good in the movie and was perfect for the part  its hard to believe that this is a true story but what can you do  when i watched this i thought why do they have to do all of those things . it isn  t right but they learned their lesson when they picked on the wrong man  anyway if you ever see this movie on tv watch it because its a good one   ,1
this movie displayed more racial hatred of jews by david mamet than i have  br    br   have ever encountered in an american film . the sterotypes are so over the top that my ability to continue watching died . i was so disappointed at joe  br    br   mantegna calling a bunch of men  sitting in a new york jewish center cleaning weapons  heros that common sense prevailed and i stopped . i am deeply  br    br   disturbed at the concept that jews are not americans and  different  . i suggest that mr . mamet is one of the causes of hatred not a healer of same .  ,0

the bfg is one of roald dahl  s most cherished books  but in this animated adaptation the magic just isn  t there . this version remains pretty faithful to dahl  s original story so one can  t lay the blame on john hambley  s script . if anything the fault lies with the colourless animation  the lethargic pace and the generally lacklustre voice  overs . one would be right to expect this story to make for a happy  vibrant  fun  filled movie . . . . . instead  the film is a hopelessly dull affair that becomes quite tedious to watch . children who are not familiar with the story should definitely read the book first  all the film will achieve is to put them off read what is actually a children  s  classic .  br    br   young orphan sophie  voice of amanda root  lives in a none  too  friendly orphanage under the cruel supervision of mrs clonkers . one evening she is peering through the window when she spots a massive figure walking stealthily down the village street . the figure realises it has been seen  so it reaches in through the window and scoops sophie from her bed  placing her into its enormous pocket before fleeing into the night . sophie soon discovers that she has been kidnapped by a giant from giant country  and fears that he will eat her . but to her relief he turns out to be a kind and sensitive member of his species who introduces himself as the bfg  voice of david jason  . the bfg refuses to eat people  instead restricting himself to foul  tasting vegetables known as snozzcumbers . however  giant country is populated by numerous other giants who do feast  every night  as it happens  on poor unsuspecting humans . sophie and the bfg become great friends  and soon they come up with a plan to thwart the other giants . together they go to the queen of england  voice of angela thorne  with their remarkable story and beg her to send the army and the air force to fight the man  eating giants . the queen agrees and so begins a dangerous operation to capture the bad giants before they can harm anyone else .  br    br   jason voices the bfg quite well  one of the few pluses in the film  but his good work is almost ruined by somewhat poor sound quality . the rest of the voice work is decidedly uninspired  with very little to bring the characters to life . similarly  the bfg is the only character that is imaginatively animated  sophie lacks appeal  and the giants are boringly designed  and look almost indistinguishable from each other  . even the places are uninventive giant country especially comes up short  being nothing more than a barren wasteland with occasional rocks and canyons . at   minutes the film is not exactly lengthy  yet it drags quite badly in parts due to the soporific handling of several sequences . little of dahl  s mischievous humour is conveyed satisfactorily . one chapter in the book deals with the bfg  s love of  whizzpopping   farting  and is laugh  out  loud hilarious . in the film  the same section is totally killed by unfunny handling . i came to the the bfg expecting lots of zest  fun and enjoyment  but what i got was pretty much the opposite  this one is a failed misfire that simply doesn  t match the calibre of the book in any department  unfortunately  therefore  it must go down as one to skip .  ,0
an absurdly hilarious and strikingly human tale of the jealousies and infidelities surrounding a beetle marriage  russian animation pioneer wladyslaw starewicz  s  mest kinematograficheskogo operatora    the cameraman  s revenge   or  the revenge of a kinematograph cameraman   is a delight of early animation  brimming with highly  effective stop  motion puppetry and no shortage of imagination .  br    br   mr . and mrs . beetle have a completely uneventful marriage  and both yearn for more excitement in their lives . mr . beetle  s desires can only be satisfied by the beautiful exotic dancer at the  gay dragonfly  night club  whom he visits whenever he takes a  business trip  to the city . she is the only one who understands him . a fellow admirer of this dancer  an aggressive grasshopper  is jealous that mr . beetle has stolen his lady and  as fate would have it  he is also a movie cameraman . the devious grasshopper follows mr . beetle and his acquaintance to a hotel room  where he films their exploits through the keyhole .  br    br   meanwhile  mrs . beetle has  likewise  acquired a friend to add excitement to her life . he is an artist  and he brings her a painting for a present  before they both settle down on the couch for some intimacy . at that moment  however  mr . beetle returns home and witnesses the entire spectacle . as mr . beetle bashes through the front door  the artist friend clambers up the chimney  but he doesn  t escape without mr . beetle first venting his anger and frustration upon him .  br    br   there is a certain irony in the statement that follows  mr . beetle is generous . he forgives his wife and takes her to a movie .  he is generous enough to forgive her  and yet he had been equally unfaithful just minutes earlier . at this point in time  however  we still haven  t forgotten the jealous movie cameraman who had been plotting his revenge  and it is no surprise when he turns out to be the projectionist for the film mr . and mrs . beetle are attending . suddenly intercut into the film they are enjoying is the footage of mr . beetle  s disloyalty  and the angry wife hits him across the head with an umbrella  before the frightened and angry husband dives through the theatre screen in search of the grasshopper .  br    br   in the final scene  both mr . and mrs . beetle  now somewhat more appreciative of each other  are serving time in prison for the fire that broke out when mr . beetle sought his final revenge . we do  indeed  hope that  the home life of the beetles will be less exciting in the future  this film may appear to be a mere story of the comings  and  goings of a miniscule insect species  but starewicz is communicating so much more than that . this isn  t a story about beetles  it is a story about us . and it  s startlingly accurate  isn  t it    ,1
there are some really terrific ideas in this violent movie that  if executed clearly  could have elevated it from spaghetti  western blandness into something special . unfortunately  a town called hell is one of the worst edited movies imaginable  scenes start and end abruptly  characters leave for long stretches  the performances  and accents  of the actors are pretty inconsistent  etc .  br    br   robert shaw is a mexican    revolutionary who  after taking part in wiping out a village  stays on to become a priest    . . . ten years later the village is being run by  mayor  telly salavas . stella stevens arrives looking for revenge on the man who killed her husband . colonel martin landau arrives looking for shaw . they all yell at each other a lot and they all shoot each other a lot . fernando rey is in it too  as a blind man  . the performances aren  t bad  but they are mightily uneven . savalas has an accent sometimes as does landau  who is really grating here  . shaw and rey prove that they are incapable of really embarrassing themselves and stevens looks pretty foxy  if a bit out of place amongst the sweaty filth  .  ,0
the performance of every actor and actress  in the film  are excellently natural which is what movie acting should be and the directing skill is so brilliantly handled on every details that i am never tired of seeing it over and over again . however  i am rather surprised to see that this film is not included in some of the actors  and director  attenborough  s credits that puzzles me aren  t they proud of making a claim that they have made such excellent  long lasting film for the audience  i am hoping i would get some answers to my puzzles from some one  possibly one of the  knowledgeable  personnel  insider  of the film .  ,1
first of all  the reason i  m giving this film  stars instead of  is because at least peter falk gave his usual fantastic performance as lieutenant columbo . he alone can get   stars for trying to save this otherwise utterly worthless attempt at making a movie .  br    br   i was initially all fired up at reading one poster  s comment that andrew stevens in this movie gave  the performance of his career .  to me  it was the abysmal performance by stevens that absolutely ruined this movie  and so i was all prepared to hurl all sorts of insults at the person who made the aforementioned comment . then i thought to myself  what else has stevens done  so i checked and  you know  that person was absolutely right . in the   years since this columbo movie was made  apparently every one of the   projects that stevens has been in since then has been utter crap  so it is doubtful that anybody has even seen the rest of his career .  br    br   if you like columbo  see every other of the   titles before watching this one . do yourself a favor and save the worst for last .  ,0
melvyn douglas once more gives a polished performance in which  this time  he inhabits the role of a detective who can  t place love before duty and adventure  and the warmly beautiful joan blondell  who  far from being illiterate  as one reviewer suggested  wrote a novel about her early life  is as enjoyable as ever as his ever  suffering sweetheart . it  s almost a screwball comedy  almost a thin man  type movie  almost a series  i guess  that didn  t quite make it to a sequel . it doesn  t quite reach classic status  but it has all the ingredients for a fun   minutes with an episodic but pacey script  fine character actors  and direction that keeps it all moving fast enough so that you nearly don  t notice that williams  douglas  isn  t exactly columbo when it comes to detecting . i wish there were more films like this .  ,1
i remember casper comic books  but don  t remember any cartoons . maybe they weren  t memorable i don  t know but at my advanced age  here i am watching this very early casper animated short yesterday . afterward  i was shocked to read the user  comments here . did people miss the ending   br    br   i have to learn all over again that casper isn  t like the other ghosts  who like to go out each night and scare the c   p out of everyone .  he sees no future in that   according to the narrator here . instead  one night he goes out to the rural section of town  inadvertently scares some animals and can  t find any friends . it brings him to tears  until a little fox hears him bawling and befriends him . the two become buddies but soon  the fox is running for his life with a fox hunt in progress .  br    br   other reviews have all mentioned what happens  so i  ll touch on that  too . the fox is killed by hunting dogs  not shown  and casper is in tears for losing  the only friend i ever had .  but  nobody mentions the happy ending to this story .  ferdie  the fox becomes a spirit  figure like casper  jumps on his lap  licks his face and the narrator comments  they lived happily ever after .  both characters look overjoyed .  br    br   what is so sad about that  this is a nice story with a nice  happy ending .  ,1
marion davies stars in this remarkable comedy  show people  released by mgm in     . davies plays a hick from savannah  georgia  who arrives in hollywood with her father  dell henderson  . the jalopy they arrive in is a hoot  as is davies outrageous southern costume . davies lands a job in slapstick comedy  not what she wants  but it brings her success . she meets fellow slapstick star william haines  who is immediately smitten with her . well  davies then gets a job at a more prestigious studio   high art studios   and lands a job in stuffy period pieces . a handsome but fake actor  andre telefair  shows her the ropes of how to be the typical pretentious hollywood star . davies abandons her slapstick friend and father for the good life  but of course learns that is not who she really is . marion davies is wonderful throughout  as she  outrageously  runs the gamut of emotions required of a  serious  actress . william haines is his usual wonderful comedic self  and there are cameos by charles chaplin  john gilbert  and other famous stars of the day  including the director of the film  king vidor . this is a silent film with a few  sound effects  as sound pictures were just coming into their own . a treasure of a film .  ,1
is this the same kim ki duk who directed the poignant  life  spanning testimonial of  spring  summer  fall  winter and spring   the same kim ki duk who directed the exquisite  nearly silent  heartbreaking longing of   iron   the same kim ki duk who dazzled us with the staggering tragedy of  the coast guard  and made us squirm about the ugliness of nonchalant teenage prostitution before returning to his almost patented nature motif to allow us all  characters and viewers alike  to experience redemption in  samaritan girl   i just cannot seem to find him in this film .  br    br   oh  sure  kim  s nature motif is still present . the film takes place entirely on a lake surrounded by mountains and on fishing floats resting placidly on the surface of calm waters . yes  it  s kim ki duk  all right . kim even describes the film as  beautiful  in an interview included in the dvd  s special features . but i  m not sure anymore what that means after viewing this putrescent presentation .  br    br   what is beautiful about angry  potty  mouthed prostitutes  lustful  violent and potty  mouthed fishermen  a covetous mute merchant  explicit animal torture  sequences of self  mutilation and a pace that swings nauseatingly between bestial carnality and mindless brutality  these are the only elements of humanity that present themselves in this utterly confounding and ultimately pointless film . if it is based on a fable or intended as a parable or is meant to be symbolic of something greater  this reviewer is unfamiliar with the source material . it has been favorably compared to  audition  by japanese director takashi miike  much to kim  s satisfaction   but aside from some astonishingly good performances  especially given what they had to work with  by lead actors seo jung and kim yoo suk  i find little reason to recommend this film . i have not seen  audition   but i doubt it would alter in any way my view of  the isle .  its violence is pornographic and senselessly sadistic . its sex is not pornographic  but passionless and masochistic . characters behave on irritating impulse because there is no plot . its point is either non  existent or  i will admit  lost amidst korean cultural quirks that i fail to understand .  br    br   the only beauty is in the cinematography  which is classic kim fog  shrouded boats lapping slowly across a serene lake  mountainous terrain dominating the background  and an imaginative and playful use of color . at times it seems as if viewers are locked in a big kim ki duk romper room . some touches  like the mysterious and seductive mute merchant played by jung and the pleasantly odd use of motorbikes  are intriguing . but as a film  this effort is downright confusing and  in the end  offensive to the senses  not necessarily to sensibilities . one hopes that kim will leave this kind of film  making in the trash heap of his past  for we know he is capable of so much more .  ,0
i  ve watched a bunch of episodes of cold case since its premiered  especially now that it immediately follows the amazing race  but this was one of the best instances of writing and acting i  ve seen from the house of bruckheimer . the casting  especially of the younger officers  was spot on  and the script and editing  the soundtrack  and the acting made this episode a tour d  force . if i were the producers i would submit this episode for emmy consideration . it amazing how complete a portrait was made of coop and jimmy within the confines of s   minute episode that takes a lot of talented people doing their best . i hope there  s is advance warning of when this episode is repeated  because i  m sure i  ll notice a lot that i did not notice the first time around .  ,1
i have seen the perfect son about three times . i fail to see how this film is a gay film  i am not even gay  but i don  t see it as a gay film . it is a film with a gay character  i can  t see why every film with a gay character should be strictly a film about being gay . i find the film to be sympathetic to the study of death  the death of someone who is your kin . i think theo turns his life around fairly quickly after rehab because he wants to and watching his brother dying in front of him makes him reassess his life . i found the dialog in the scene when theo tells ryan he is going to be a father to be very moving  ryan states that he doesn  t want to know about the things he is never going to see or share with anyone . isn  t that horrific and sad  i highly recommend the film .  ,1
i loved this movie . when i saw it on febuary  rd i knew i had to buy it    it comes out to buy on july   th    it has cool deaths scenes  hot girls  great cast  good story  good acting . great slasher film . the movies is about some serial killer killing off four girls . see this movies  ,1
love hurts . that  i think  is the main message mike binder  s newest film reign over me brings across . whether that love has caused your relationship to become stagnant  or has brought anger from the one you love cheating for years  or has broken your heart to the point of being unable to open yourself up to the world  love hurts . the great thing about this film  however  is not in its portrayal of these lost souls trying to let their past heartbreaks go  but in the eventual restart of new bonds for the future . no one in this drama is perfect they are all at some degree trapped emotionally in relationships that they can  t free themselves from alone . there is some heavy subject material here and i credit binder for never making the story turn into a political diatribe  but instead infusing the serious moments with some real nice comedic bits allowing the tale to stay character  based and small in scale compared to the epic event that looms overhead . what could have become a trite vehicle for opinions on how     effected us all  ends up being a story about two men and a connection they share that is the only thing which can save their lives from a life of depression and regret .  br    br   this is a new career performance for adam sandler . i like to think that my favorite director paul thomas anderson was the first to see the childish  pent  up anger in his stupid comedies as something to use dramatically . the juvenility of a character like billy madison allows for laughs and potty humor  but also can be used to show a repressed man  shy and shutout to the world around hima man with no confidence that needs an event of compassion to break him from his shell . anderson let sandler do just that in his masterpiece punch  drunk love and mike binder has taken it one step further . sandler plays former dentist charlie fineman whose wife and three kids were killed in one of the planes that took down the world trade center on     . that one moment crushed any life that he had and as a result  he became reclusive and started to believe he couldn  t remember anything that happened before that day . he really delivers a moving portrait of a man trying to keep up the charade in his head while those around him  those that love him  try and open him up to the reality of what happened and what the future holds . always on edge and ready to snap at any moment when something is mentioned to spark the memory of his perished family  he goes through life with his ipod and headphones  shutting out everything so as not to be tempted remember .  br    br   reign over me is not about charlie fineman though  it is about dentist and family man alan johnson . a man that has trapped himself into a marriage and dental practice that both have stagnated into monotony  johnson needs as much help in his life as his old college roommate charlie does . played perfectly by the always brilliant don cheadle  johnson has lost his backbone to try and change his life . he has no friends and when he sees charlie  by chance  one day  his life evolves into something he hasn  t felt in   years . he revels in the chance to go out with an old friend no matter how much he has changed from the death of his family . cheadle  s character wants to revert back to the college days of hanging out and sandler  s doesn  t mind because all that was before he met his wife . the two men get what they want and allow themselves to grow close despite the years of solitude that used to rule their lives . once they begin opening up though  it is inevitable that the subject of the tragedy will creep up and test the faade they have created for themselves .  br    br   the supporting cast does an amazing job helping keep up appearances for the two leads . jada pinkett smith has never been an actress that impressed me and throughout the film played the tough as nails wife nicely  but it is her final scene on the phone with cheadle that really showed me something different and true . liv tyler is a bit out of her element as a psychiatrist  but the movie calls her on this fact and makes the miscasting  perfect casting . the many small cameos are also effective  even writer  director mike binder  s role as sandler  s old best friend and accountant   my only gripe here is why he feels the need to put his name in the opening credits as an actor when it is everywhere  considering it is his film  . last but not least is the beautiful saffron burrows . she is a great actress and plays the love  crushed divorce trying to put her life back together wonderfully . a role that seems comic relief at first  but ends up being an integral aspect for what is to come .  br    br   binder has crafted one of the best dramatic character studies i have seen in a long time . the direction is almost flawless   the blurring between cuts and characters in the fore  background really annoyed me in the beginning   the acting superb  and the story true to itself  never taking the easy way out or wrapping itself up with a neatly tied bow at the conclusion . even the music was fantastic and used to enhance  not to lead us emotionally   why after two great uses of the titular song by the who did binder feel the need to use the inferior eddie veddar remake for the end  i don  t know  but it did unfortunately stick out for me  . reign over me is a film about love and how although it can cause the worst pain imaginable  it can also save us from regret and allow us to once again see the world as a place of beauty and hope .  ,1
a riotous farce set in the world of glamorous daytime soap operas  this film is hilarious  admittedly  you have to have a taste for films with screaming  hysterical dialogue  over  the  top acting  and melodramatic plot twists . but if you do  you  re in for one hell of a treat .  br    br   sally field plays celeste talbert  daytime tv  s  queen of misery .  celeste  s cushy life is thrown into upheaval with the unexpected arrival of lori craven  elisabeth shue   her long  lost niece  and  simultaneously  jeffrey anderson  kevin kline  splendid as always   celeste  s long  ago lover . but celeste has been hiding a deep  dark secret  and the arrival of lori and jeffrey might just bring it to the surface . add in the diabolical montana moorehead  a wonderful cathy moriarty  in full  gorgeous woman with testosterone to spare mode    who is trying mighty hard to destroy celeste  s career david  robert downey  jr .   the weenie  boy producer of the soap who  s secretly plotting with montana to ruin celeste and  rose schwarz  whoopi goldberg   scriptwriter and celeste  s one true confidant  and you are in for a heaping helping of subplots and general chaos .  br    br   chaotic comedies like this are tricky to execute  does anyone remember  mixed nuts     but when done well  can be pretty damn funny  a major ingredient that is necessary to any good comedy is the casting of seasoned pros who know that lots of times the funniest things are not said but seen in an expression or a look . field  kline  goldberg  and the rest all work together so well and are clearly having a great time that it is hard not to become drawn in by their energy and enthusiasm . shue is clearly the weakest link here  but she only draws attention to herself because she is surrounded by field  kline  et al . moriarty is a stand  out in the showy villainess role  making you think of the hottest damn dominatrix you ever did see   there are also lots of familiar faces that you  ll recognize in small  but  nevertheless  all very funny  roles  including carrie fisher  garry marshall  kathy najimy  and teri hatcher . director michael hoffman keeps the pace swift and the histrionic plot moving toward the big finish . mention must also be made of robert harling  s screenplay  carefully constructed to stage a soap opera within a soap opera . the dialogue is boiling over with great lines  delivered brilliantly by the actors  i  d be willing to bet that a lot of this stuff was improvised  .  br    br   look  if you want to see a bunch of pros doing what they do best and having a great time doing it  get your hands on this one . if not for anything else  it will put you in a good mood and make you laugh   ,1
this is the biggest pile of crap i have ever watched . do not rent  the makers of this movie should be band from ever making another movie . it starts with some what of a plot  then fades fast to nothing . i think i would rather watch paint dry then to as much as looking at the cover . the actors were awful  the plot faded fast  filming left to much work to be done . not one good thing to say about this crap movie . if you rent this movie you will waste your money . i really enjoy national lampoon movies  but this was a waste of time . learn to write  learn to act  learn to produce  and learn to direct . i feel i should sue these a  holes that made this movie for money wasted on rental cost and time lost .  ,0
i  m a big fan of camp  but when every plot  twist  is predictable and bad  while obviously not trying to be  even i lose interest . i was going to rate this a   but the ending dropped it a point easily . its only saving grace is that i hated other movies more . not enough beer in the world for this one .  ,0
i have seen dolemite and also  avenging  disco godfather  two other fine works of the blaxploitation canon from our friend rudy ray moore . but this film  the human tornado  aka dolemite   will always hold a special place in my heart . for sheer goofiness  lack of skill in film production  and absolute enthusiasm  frankly a little too much   the human tornado cannot be topped .  br    br   the opening scene sets the tone . our old pal dolemite is shacking up with a white woman  when some racist local cops raid the house for no good reason  and wouldn  t you know it  the woman in bed with ol  dole is none other than the sheriff  s wife . her cry when she sees him  he made me do it   dolemite  s cry   are you for real     subtlety was never his strong point .  br    br   highlights  the cameo by a very young ernie hudson  of ghostbusters fame   the continuity errors  characters looking one way in one shot  and another in the next  dolemite  s suit changing colors in every single shot of his nightclub act   and queen bee  s demonic eyes in her first scene .  br    br   but the real joy here is rudy ray moore himself . did the man really think he looked cool in this movie  i certainly don  t know why  but you have to admire the sheer enthusiasm he has . whether it be jumping totally naked off a cliff  or barking orders to his gang in rhyme  e . g quick  into the cave  i have a plan to let that mother    dig his own grave   the man commits totally . certainly he goes overboard  nevermore so than any time he  s doing kung fu . the climactic battle is filmed at high speed  but occassionaly slows down to let rudy pose and grits his teeth . i  m not sure if they wanted it too look like they sped up the film as an effect or if they really wanted us to believe he was that fast . in any event   the matrix  it is not .  br    br   human tornado  much like the original dolemite  is an incompetent film of enormous proportions . but at least it  s fun  and certainly you have to give credit to these people for the effort . just not that much . enjoy with my hearty recommendations .  ,0
what can i say  i have grown up watching hum saath saath hain  hum aapke hain koun and maine pyar kiya . soraj have always been different . movies are part of our lives in evolutionary times soraj creates something thats hard to find . love and joint family that loving and great . vivah is journey for a couple that are getting arrange marriage that turns on arrange and love marriage . shahid has done fine work . anupamji as always brilliant . amrita rao quit different even though i felt that someway the other to me she doesn  t suit in that role . we  ve seen her in ishk vishk and ab ke baras  and main ho on na . so quit different role that she isn  t in to . she is been excellent in main ho on na and ishk vishk but may be she could  ve put little more in the role . anyways great going work by barjatya . this movie rejuvenates the values that we forgot . sweet film of the year . great music and lyrics . i am not sure if its a remake but anyways brilliant story that is original . soraj  s movies have been brilliant all the way so we always expect something different from him . great work by all the cast the crew and everybody . lovely family film to enjoy with your parents  siblings  friends and love ones . i give it   out of   .  ,1
this is not a profound movie most of the plot aspects are pretty predictable and  tried and true  but it was well  acted and made some interesting points about what we might regret  our  mistakes  as the movie calls them  as we look back over our lives . i had not read the book  so didn  t know much other than it was the story of a dying woman who has strong memories from long ago that she hasn  t really shared with anyone . thankfully they got a top  notch cast . . . . meryl  br    br   streep  s daughter  mamie gummer  plays the young lila  and then meryl shows up at the end of the film as the old lila . . . in addition to an amazing resemblance  duh   the younger actress did a great job  perhaps not quite up to her mom  s caliber  but who is   all others in this film were fine  although i wish there had been more of glen close and thought the buddy character was alittle too dramatic .  br    br   this is more of a girls  movie than for the guys  but a good one to see with your mom  or your daughter  and maybe start some dialog going . how hard it is to really know a parent as a  person    ,1
i realize that bringing a novel to the big screen is always problematic . that is the only positive thing i can say about this truly horrid adaptation .  br    br   have you read  wise blood   it  s an amazing book . flannery o  connor wrote about the south as no one else has . she was a southerner herself  a devout catholic  and a remarkably gifted writer . in her first novel she wove together a dark and deeply disturbing tale of faith  doubt  and redemption with a macabre sense of humor and surprising evenhandedness . the characters in the book may seem outrageous to those who have not lived in the rural south  but i can assure you that such people do exist . not only do they exist  they are human beings with families  feelings  and concerns like anyone else . flannery  s intentions were so often misunderstood  she was not lampooning these backwoods zealots  she saw in them the beautiful operation of what she would have called  grace  . . . even in the most violent  distressing  and maddening of circumstances . to read  wise blood  is to be washed over with a sense of dread and impending doom . finally  it is to think long and hard about our judgments and preconceptions  our entire world view .  br    br   none of this comes through in john huston  s  gilligan  s island   like adaptation . none . it is a farce . a bad farce . the entire film is saturated with a hauteur that turns the stomach . the acting is poor  the southern accents are fake and insulting . the filmmakers show no insight into the thinking of religious southerners . ms . o  connor  s intense prose are reduced to sight gags and cheap  amateur theatre . the soundtrack is a mixture of hayseed silliness and  clockwork orange   style cheeseball electronics that doesn  t fit the story or even the movie . i was granted free admission to this movie and almost walked out . truly  truly terrible .  br    br   as an aside  i do not agree with ms . o  connor  s religious views  and while i was raised in the deep south  years ago i made my way north and have not looked back . but the south is a beautiful place full of fascinating individuals  like every other place on earth   and the cartoonish mockery with which southerners and their attitudes are dealt in this movie borders on offensive . if you  re into being offended  which i am not   then this movie most definitely crosses the line .  br    br   i don  t like to talk crap about an artist  s work  john huston was a man that i did not know  and i  m sure he was a sincere and gifted filmmaker  to which his respected place in film history attests . my views are clearly skewed by having read  and loved  flannery o  connor  s work . so i don  t claim to be coming from any other perspective . maybe as a stand  alone film it works for cinephiles . but for flannery o  connor fans  and  i might add  for self  respecting southerners and openminded individuals of all stripes  this movie is a waste of time .  ,0
of course  the original is better  but this isn  t as bad as everyone says  yes  it is made up into  stories  but hey  so what   i thought it was quite good to be honest . i actually liked how anastasia changed a little when she fell in love  it shows what love can do . the stories were not so bad either .  br    br   i liked cinderella  s voice better in this too . i have nothing against her voice in the original  but i just think it sounds better here  more nicer . i liked her personality in this too  she had more of a backbone  yet she was still kind .  br    br   so  i  ll give cinderella iidreams come true a     .  ,1
mmm  doesn  t a big stack of pancakes sound good  maple syrup and fruit preserves on top . take a bite . mmmmmmm . take another bite . another . another . eat . eat it  you    keep shoveling it down your throat until your face turns green with nausea . you have just had the ally mcbeal experience .  br    br   i stumbled on this show in the winter of    and was instantly hooked . like that stack of pancakes  i gorged myself on it . but the enjoyment soon wore off  because the ally mcbeal character  whom we see to be cute  endearing at first sight  soon becomes the most annoying  insecure  whining complainer you  ve ever met .  call me a feminist  but i prefer my female leads to have a spine .  the gags  gimmicks of the show also become hackneyed  the music of vonda shepherd  which is really shoved in your face  becomes grating  and the incessant character changes  rewrites make the show into a damn soap opera .  br    br   my advice to you is to take this show in small doses  and quit as soon as it becomes bothersome  and it will  . i made it through  .  seasons before my enjoyment had totally soured . it was good while it lasted  but like a crazy  neurotic ex  girlfriend it just turned ugly after it had overstayed its welcome .  br    br   and next time you go to ihop  skip the pancakes . order something healthy like the fruit cup . it  ll sit with you much better .  ,0
this film deals with two ex  football players who are fred williamson   mack derringer  and gary busey   lenny  who work as private eyes and meet all kinds of ladies and men with some bad backgrounds . mack derringer is approached by his ex  wife vanity  jennifer derringer  who works at having sex talk over the telephone . jennifer is being threatened by one caller who wants to do horrible things to her and she asks for his help along with several other ladies . mack  lenny have more time on their hands and often go to miami  fl . golf courses or hang out in a sports bar where all kinds of city things go on . there is lots of punches  killings and plenty of double meaning words that bring this film completely down to a big zero . don  t waste your time  this film cost me only   cents and that was too much .  ,0
hard to believe that director barbet schroeder once did the majestic and very funny maitresse        and now only seems to do  by the numbers  hollywood thrillers .  br    br   this is very lightweight john grisham material  crossed with the plot of a tv movie . bullock is cass mayweather  a feisty and independent crime investigator specialising in serial killers . ben chaplin is her reserved police partner sam kennedy  and together they make an uncomfortable duo . not good  when two unbalanced college maladriots  gosling and pitt  decide to send them on a wild goose chase  by planting very clever and misleading forensic evidence at a crime scene .  br    br   fair enough  but while bullock and chaplin fail to create any sparks  we also have to endure a several dull overly  melodramatic flashbacks illustrating an important event in cass  s history . then of course there are the frequent shots of a cliff  side log cabin where there  s absolutely no doubt the ott ending will be set . oooh . . . the atmosphere .  br    br   watch any episode of csi instead . it  s to the point and far more exciting .  ,0
this is to the zatoichi movies as the  star trek  movies were to  star trek    except that in this case every one of the originals was more entertaining and interesting than this big  shiny re  do  and also better made  if substance is more important than surface . had i never seen them  i would have thought this good  looking but empty since i had  i thought its style inappropriate and its content insufficient . the idea of reviving the character in a bigger  slicker production must have sounded good  but there was no point in it  other than the hope of making money it  s just a show  which mostly fails to capture the atmosphere of the character  s world and wholly fails to take the character anywhere he hasn  t been already  also  the actor wasn  t at his best  . i  d been hoping to see ichi at a late stage of life  in a story that would see him out gracefully and draw some conclusion from his experience overall this just rehashes bits and pieces from the other movies  seasoned with more sex and sfx violence . not the same experience at all .  ,0
when the british film institute asked martin scorcese to create the american part of its century of the cinema series  he grabbed the opportunity with both hands . a personal journey through american movies is a fascinating  wide  ranging and  as the title says  a highly personal look at hollywood cinema .  br    br   scorcese  s story is primarily about hollywood  s directors  actors  producers  screenwriters and other collaborators barely get a mention . he states right from the beginning that for him the primary conflict within the film industry is that between the director  s vision and the distributor  s profit motive  between art and commercial viability . he even opens with a clip from vincente minnelli  s the bad and the beautiful  one of the earliest films to openly explore this contradiction . this dictates the structure for the documentary . scorcese looks at how genres have darkened and clichs have become challenged  how mavericks have challenged the production code  and how certain filmmakers fell from grace when they dared to be different . however  scorcese never falls into the auteurist trap of dismissing directors who consistently pleased the studio bosses  he lavishes praise on cecil b . de mille   or those who had less of a recognisable style but were master craftsmen of the cinema nonetheless .  br    br   scorcese doesn  t necessarily focus on his absolute favourite directors either  orson welles and alfred hitchcock  two of scorcese  s biggest influences  are only mentioned in passing  . instead  he looks at the individuals and the films that serve to tell his story . for example  he shows us a succession of john ford films to show how the western evolved . he looks at the work of vincente minnelli  probably the most often referenced director of the documentary  to show how a supposedly wholesome genre like the musical could also have darker undercurrents . i can imagine that  had this assignment not been limited to america  scorcese would have also loved to talk about  for example his italian influences or his british hero michael powell . as it is  he stretches the definition of american movies to include both the hollywood films of immigrant directors such as fw murnau  billy wilder and douglas sirk  as well as the work of us  born filmmakers that was produced elsewhere  such as that of stanley kubrick .  br    br   rather than simply tell the story of hollywood chronologically  scorcese compares films from various eras in order to tackle various subjects . in his section on the language and tools of cinema  he begins with dw griffith  looks at the coming of sound  colour and widescreen and inevitably ends up going over computer generated effects which  although scorcese is not keen on them  he is even  handed enough to include clips of george lucas and francis ford coppola defending them . however  he doesn  t simply finish the chapter here as if this is the end of it . instead  he then rewinds back to the     s  to show how a low  budget horror like the cat people can achieve effective results from the simplest and cheapest of elements .  br    br   a personal journey through american movies has to be one of the best film documentaries made . there were a number of outstanding directors and pictures which i would never have discovered without  and even the most seasoned of film buffs would be likely to find something new in its broad scope . scorcese has also restored the balance to forgotten or undervalued pictures . i was pleased to see that  when he talks about kubrick in his  iconoclasts  chapter  he looks at lolita and barry lindon  for me his two most underrated films . scorcese  s respect for the medium is on display in the way he allows clips to play out fully  rather than just giving us tiny bits  and he interrupts them with talking heads  a combination of archive and new interviews  only when necessary . there is a bit of bias towards the   s and   s  but that is hardly surprising since it is the era in which scorcese grew up and discovered cinema . and after all  i don  t think this documentary could have been achieved had it not been a personal journey .  br    br   one word of warning though  in its in depth look at certain pictures  this documentary does contain a fair few spoilers .  ,1
it was an excellent piece to the puppet series because this film showed all of the series  from one to seven . and this was about one woman trying to stop the new puppet master because i would have never guessed that the puppets would be in pain . plus it showed some of the puppet master series that i didn  t see and i what to see it so badly like part two . it showed an appearance of torch which can turn things and humans  which is cool  and showed the return of the puppet master from part one . it also showed little aliens from part  that was also cool  it showed other people episodes that might be good to them and it did . so thanks to this puppet master is going to be a big hit .  ,1
the film  cross eyed  by adam jones propels the viewer on a ride of redemption as the main character takes back control of the wheel and sets his life in order . adam jones has found an imaginative and refreshing way to empower his character and actualize what matters most . these truths become apparent to both the characters and viewers as you laugh and gag to the credits with them . the simple yet attractive settingscostumes keep you guessing about what you will see next . you can  t help but smile and laugh at the antics that take place in this movie . i can  t wait for his sophomore effort . it is only a matter of time before jones strikes again . bravo   ,1
  i like cheap perfume better it doesn  t last as long . . .   ralph meeker  s convict character  lawson  tells this to barbara stanwyck  s helen character  after he gets a whiff of the perfume that she picked out w  her husband in tijuana . . .  this line cracked me up  and also seemed like a metaphor for this film  that cheap is better than expensive  because a cheap perfume  loving man who has a way with a  x  is a better man to have around in the long run  i agree with some of the other comments posted about helen  s attraction to lawson . even though her narration states that she wants lawson to be put away  she did seem attracted to his fiery nature  and that passion he stirred up in her wouldn  t likely wash away with the tide   ,1
i can  t believe i actually watched this but i guess i just wanted to know if this movie would get unintentionally funnier and funnier towards the end . and it did . the climax was the poorest performance ever given by the defence lawyer  so out of real life that even for a fictional story it was far too weird . no way anyone on this planet can behave in front of a court like she did . and probably the worst prosecutor on earth . why was he in court anyway  he did nothing and absolutely nothing to prove her guilty . a simple search of her house would have resulted in the find of the rings . but no go . he preferred to say  objection   or  times during the whole trial  that was it . the blonde lunatic was given a truth  drug to prove her innocent but not brett . the lunatic almost had an altar of brett in her home that could have proved her sick obsession . but again no go . during the court scene i felt the silent urge to take the needlepoint out of her hand and bang it several times against her head . even real weirdos do not look that silly fake  i am innocent  like she did . and what does this movie tell us  never marry a woman with a life insurance as soon as she falls down the stairs her husband will be thrown into jail  guilty or not . evil  evil men .  ,0
i caught this movie on t . v . last night and you know danny masterson was a pretty good actor in the film  and its great to see him in something other than that   s show . the film isnt rated but in my opinion i would rate it  r  just because of the nudity and plenty of adult content . but all in all i loved it  i thought that dirt  s wisecracks were pretty funny . its just basically about a guy who has no job  girlfriend  or money and eventually gets a job as a private investigator  more of a messenger really .  he gets framed for the murder of a rock star and the rock stars girlfriend is one of the people that really need to help him out . i give it . . . .   stars .  ,1
for columbo fans  such as myself  this is the episode of episodes that made a case for why columbo was so popular  and just how good it really was . ruth gordon has a field day  as ever  playing the wittily intelligent crime novelist abigail mitchell . seems abigail calls her nephew  in  law to sign some papers making him her heir . she never got over her niece  s death  and is convinced her dead niece  s husband  charles frank  did the dirty deed . to tell more would be unthinkable . mariette hartley has a sly role as abigail  s personal assistant . this episode of columbo is in a class by itself . it  s a truly well made television movie . i recommend it most highly .  ,1
i absolutely hate it when a film completely falls apart near the end  after you  ve already invested an hour into it . and that  s what happened with this film . i was intrigued by its actors and the fact that malamud wrote its source story . i haven  t gone to read that story but i cannot imagine that it ends like this film ends . fortunately i didn  t pay good money to see or rent it because my library had it . ohhhh such a waste of excellent acting  the wife in particular was so perfect  . but milo o  shea as a jew      now that was funny . i haven  t researched into its making but it played like the director lost his marbles or died    of the way through the film . before that point  a story and characters were developing  there were a number of neat plot points and there wasn  t too much time wasted . but ooh that last    hour  if that wasn  t the screwiest  most worthless denouement i  ve ever witnessed  i don  t know what is . i just hate it when one  s faith is so destroyed like that it feels like an act of violence .  ,0
just saying you  ve got a movie about john holmes is a guarantee to get some folks in front of the screen  but writer  director james cox delivers oh so much more . a  rashamon  of the sleazy hollywood set  the film splitters the july     wonderland murders through a variety of angles  and film stocks   but mostly through the filter of john holmes  coked out weasel brain . in a film full of bad guys holmes is either the most vile  the most pathetic or both . several versions of the story emerge and merge as cox flashes jump cuts and twisting title cards amid effects and emoting . the dialogue is fast and naturalistic and never once rings false . while the film takes places two years after holmes had fallen out of porn and into a truly wicked drug fueled depravity  kilmer relentlessly exudes a sexuality so intense it can be measured in inches . this sexuality at its edges creates a sense of foreboding that hangs over the entire film almost as heavily as the violence at its center . those murders are teased at through the whole film though are never clearly shown  not even at the climax  though the violence of them relentlessly infuses the whole picture and much blood is splattered across walls and crime scene photos . once again val kilmer as holmes shows he can act wacko better than anyone else working . strutting  cringing  bragging or begging  kilmer is constantly in character and the character is constantly a fascinating car wreck . stand out performances beside kilmer definitely include ted levine as the lead cop in the investigation and lisa kudrow as holmes estranged wife . the trio of criminals holmes falls in with include the frighteningly high energy josh lucas  the ever interesting timothy blake nelson and an absolutely unrecognizable dylan mcdermott in a pivotal role as the teller yet another version of the murders . cox suggests that no matter how much we learn about wonderland  there is always a worse version possible  but looking through the debauchery surrounding it is much more fascinating than understanding the truth .  ,1
this third pokemon movie is too abstract for younger kids to follow and too repetitious to entertain older kids . the message of the film   about dealing with loss   is subverted by the return of the young girl  s father during the film  s credits . team rocket provide some amusement  but they  re not really part of the small plot  so they don  t appear very often .  ,0
yes  shakespeare would indeed have been proud . laurence fishburne was not at his best but certainly not bad . kenneth brannagh on the other hand was brilliant . his scheming was wonderful as was his toying with the audience . very nice work .  br    br   there were at times too little drama where more would have been expected . cassio  s slaying  for instance  was a bit clouded by too much happening to far apart  causing the spectator to twist his head to grasp it all .  br    br   did i mention michael maloney  his madness striken roderigo was unusual annoying even .  br    br   if you haven  t seen othello before  see this . if you haven  t read othello  see this . if you haven  t heard othello  see this . you do  on the other hand  do yourself a favour by reading it  seeing it acted onstage and hearing it sung too .  ,1
if this movie were more about piper perabo  s character and less about the bar  this might have been halfway decent . piper  s violet stanford and karen friendly  adventures of rocky and bullwinkle  both have a virgin kindegarden teacher quality to them that  s endearing . here  s hoping she  ll find a better movie to be in .  ,0
this movie was yet another waste of time . . . why oh why do i keep renting crap like this  . . . someone please tell me . . . sigh oh well . back to the movie at hand cube zero is probably worth it if you really really enjoyed the first movie   like i did   and just want to check out what  s up in the last  hopefully  movie scraped together just to keep some poor actors and screenwriters employed  then of course this is the movie for you . but if you are looking for a good movie with good acting and a fantastic plot . . . evil grin then this movie is definitely for you   d . . . . ok i  m lying . . . at best this movie sucks . ok  i have to admit that certain elements to it was cool . . well . . coolish . . . and i laughed quite a few times  prolly at the wrong things  but nevertheless i was amused .    but all in all the few things that barely makes the  ok  category isn  t enough to make this movie worth it at all . . unless you count  manos  hand of fate  one of the top ten movies ever   ,0
i saw this piece of garbage on amc last night  and wonder how it could be considered in any way an american movie classic . it was awful in every way . how badly did jack lemmon  james stewart and the rest of the cast need cash that they would even consider doing this movie   ,0
what people fail to understand about this movie is that it isn  t a beginning  middle  and end  it is just the conclusion of a   episode long tv series . so remember that when you all talk about how the world wasn  t explored enough . that was all done in the tv show .  br    br   as great and stunning as the visuals are  i think the spoilers argument between lian  chu and gwizdo near the end of the film was what really made me love this movie . seeing characters i had followed through   episodes fight like that was agonizing  and seeing gwizdo walking sadly off by himself amidst the floating ruins while lian  chu sharpened his blade was almost tear  jerking .  br    br   then we got a total contrast with lian  chu fighting these insanely awesome dragons  which had been featured before in the series  while gwizdo is babbling insanely and indirectly threatening to kill zoe . shudder i  m surprised that this particular scene hasn  t been mentioned more in the warnings . any kid that has a lick of sense will be able to see that gwizdo wasn  t himself and was fully intent on strangling that little girl . it was enough to bother me  and i  m   .  br    br   the world is amazing  the plot is a lot better than most multi  million blockbusters  and it was a nice way to see some of my favorite characters go . check it out .    ,1
without kirsten miller this project needn  t have been completed . however with the awe inspiring beauty and talent that is miss miller i would definitely recommend it . it looked as if the other actors were only playing to her strong performance . wagner  s dismal attempt to honor this film was a bit disappointing  but his few scenes didn  t detract from being entertained . mostly my criticisms are with the writing and plot line  the group of talent assembled did a heroic job of salvaging what should have been a disaster . the charismatic miller delivery and timing were impeccable and believable . she plays that fine line between assertive and bossy but never offensive she is in fact the structural engineer she claims to be . i wish i had seen this on the big screen but alas i was fortunate to rent it before it was lost .  ,1

tommy jones and matt dillon do the gambling world proud . the various moves with the wrists had to be learned as throwing craps is a skill in and of itself .  br    br   there are a few surprises . as cynical as we are today  i fully expected the  good girl  to be crying over his grave  instead of his buddy  s . especially with her remarks about  going to the funeral of her best friend   when she first meets matt . and then of course you expect matt to kill the guy who threw battery acid in mr . allen  s face  blinding him  interesting role by bruce dern  . wrrrooonnnnggg    some of the other hollywood endings do happen  but the writing is so excellent  the acting so carefully wrought that you  re blissfully unaware .  br    br   and the music is out of this world . taking us back to the   s when our  native passions  were first being unleashed by the music of ray charles and bo diddley . even a little racism raring its ugly head in chicago  but at a club called  wonderfully   biloxi  with a confederate flag backing up the racist remarks . i  ll be watching it again  just to hear the music . good thing i have the factotum sound track  so i can listen to that in the car . watch both together  and you  ll see how matt has matured . . . . playing bar room characters in both . now that he owns a bar in the paramount hotel in nyc  he probably has great opportunity to do his studies . great actor  just coming into his own . he shows finely nuanced performances . . . the good and the bad in his characters . his  young boy off the farm  is a great study  made especially poignant because of his bassett  hound eyes . he makes love  convincingly as well . since he was in several movies with diane lane as a teen  ager  i wonder how that it . . . making love to an actress you kinda grew up with . adds conviction  i  ll say that .  ,1

i watched the un  aired episodes online and i was so sad that the show won  t be back . it had the best cast of mature  talented actors and an amazing chemistry . it seemed like all the actors are personal friends in real life . towards the end the show became engaging  sexy and highly watchable . of course  some of the story lines are not realistic  so what . . . the characters are all likable and you root for them . the show reminded me a cross between  other favorites  sex and the city  and  felicity  . big kudos to all the cast . note to abc execs nielsen ratings reports do not show you true results . the show audience will mostly record it . i  ve been very disappointed with major networks for flooding us with reality  tv or teenage oriented shows . why to get a mature  thoughtful  well  acted material we have to switch to hbo or fx  i can only thank the network for putting the rest of the episodes online . the new stream media will gain more and more popularity among viewers .  ,1
i am very surprised to see such a high rating for this film  and of the few reviews that there are to be positive . i saw the movie and was pretty dissapointed . i didn  t find it very enjoyable at all . it was slow  and lacks the entertainment value . even the murder scenes are lackluster  with real close  up shots of generic stabbings that don  t look good at all . and the supposed great twist ending is really not much  i did see it coming  and then the ending just seemed cliche . this movie may not get much mention  but by the little that it does get  it is overrated . i would not recommend this movie .  ,0
i was but a babe in arms when george lucas was wowing the world with his out of this world saga chronicling the adventures of young luke skywalker and the notorious darth vadar but even today   years on i can appreciate the genius that is lucas and the incredible imagination he  s been blessed with . in a new hope lucas showed a new way to tell stories as he introduced us to such memorable characters as the plucky princess leia  the rougish han solo and the spirited luke skywalker as well as that best loved of villains  the sinister darth vadar . in the empire strikes back he went all out to show us special effects can add to a tale and managed to something no  one thought you could do on screen . he made a film with no specific end or beginning and it went down a treat . return of the jedi is a fitting end to a saga that will stand the test of time .  br    br   when the empire srtikes back ended with encasing of the lovable rouge han solo in carbonite to be delivered to jabba the hut and young luke reeling from the discovery of a terrible truth about his father we were left with the feeling that things were going from bad to worse . vadar it seemed had won the day . how we asked could the rebels ever recover from this blow  in lucas stunning and captivating final chapter we are kept on the edges of our seats from han  s daring rescue from jabba  s palace to the the final climactic battle on the death star between luke and vadar as luke struggles between fulfilling his duties as a jedi and rebel fighter and attempting to reawaken the good he believes is still in his father  s soul .  br    br   old friends like the smooth talking lando calrissian and the ever lovable chewbacca reunite for one final battle to end all battles as a new darker more dangerous enemy emerges in the form of the emperor himself  played by the brilliant ian mcdiarmiud . how he missed out on an oscar is a mystery .  desperate to turn luke to the dark side even if it means betraying his apprentice darth vadar . all in black with his red eyes  ghostly white disfigured face and sinister laugh he truly is a terrifying addition to the story and is the undisputed master of the events that unfold . his new and improved death star spells disaster for the rebels but the brave group launch one last desperate attack to end the empire  s reign for good .  br    br   lucas managed to incorporate three different stories at once and keep the action going so that the audience is riveted . we watch in excitement as han and leia attempt to bring down the shield around the death star from the forest moon of endor with the help of some adorable ewoks  who i really do not believe take from the movie at all . in fact i feel they provide a sort reprieve from the tension of the battles at and in the death star  and hindered by legions of stormtroopers and imperial officers . we cheer on lando and the other pilots as they take on the mighty imperial fleet and risk life and limb to fly into the deatn star to destroy it once and for all . and we watch with bated breath as vadar and the emperor attempt to turn luke to the dark side while he in turn tries to turn his father back .  br    br   but for me the most difficult and yet compelling battles is that going on inside darth vadar . for rotj is a battle of emotions and feelings . vadar is caught between his loyalty to the emporer and the empire and his fatherly inclinations to luke . never did i think that a mask could show emotion but some  how one can  t but see the confusion and pain on vadar  s face during the final scenes as the emporer turns on luke . there is more depth and emotion to vadar than i believed a villain  especially one more machine then man could have and that i think is what makes him so accessible . he is conflicted . the apprentice as much as the master . the victim as much as the villain . without ruining the end too much vadar  s final scene is the most poignant and wonderful in the trilogy .  br    br   so in conclusion what can i say . george lucas is the master of the saga . star wars is the most compelling and engaging sagas i  ve seen in a long time and i have yet to see another saga rival it . return of the jedi has all the ingredients necessary to provide the ending lucas masterpiece deserves . it  s action  suspense  romance  tragedy  redemption  joy all rolled into one and it  s memorable characters  wonderful special effects and catchy music make both a great movie in its own right and an ending that lucas can be proud of .  ,1
i do agree that though this story by melville just might be unfilmable  this isn  t even a credible try . to move the story into the   th century just outrages the original story  s intent and nature possibly you might have been able to move it over to england  but it must be a period piece . even our story narrator   the proprietor   tells it in a flashback  going back even further  somewhere around     . towards the end of the   th century  a strangely disobedient worker would be discarded without a thought . and the   th century  come on  give me an expletive deleted break    even around      such behavior didn  t work very well  in view of the ending . and the movie  s ending  i don  t know what it was  because i didn  t watch the entire travesty   i had to stop . this was like setting  streetcar named desire  in elizabethan england .  ,0
a great idea   stories about   september .   directors from different countries with different results . ken loach talking about an immigrant  as usual  is just brilliant  as usual  . the frenchman does a very good job also  while the burkina faso film was a nice surprise . however  the israel film was a bit boring  and the mexican guy  well  he should quit directing and work in a mexican restaurant .      ,1
la coda dello scorpione  a . k . a . case of the scorpion  s tail  was director sergio martino  s follow  up to the wonderful giallo strano vizio della signora wardh . this is the quintessential giallo  featuring all the aspects fans of the genre have come to know and love . twisty plot  beautiful girls  black gloves  sharp blades  and a bit of gore all come together to make one heck of a piece of italian exploitation .  br    br   a group of gialli favorites  both in front of and behind the camera  work to make this one of the best non  argento gialli around . there  s the aforementioned martino adding his touches as director  giallo great ernesto gastaldi as the writer  bruno nicolai creating the music  and a host of giallo stars and starlets  such as george hilton  character actor luigi pistilli  and the fetching anita strindberg .  br    br   with all this talent behind it  does scorpione deliver  you bet . the film works on many different levels . it  s a thrilling murder mystery  a tense and violent horror film  and a suspenseful thriller . all in all one of the best gialli around .  br    br   martino definitely knows what fans want when it comes to gialli . at some points in the film  he almost seems to be channeling argento in his approach . for example  there is a direct rip  off of the scene in bird with the crystal plumage where the killer tries to break through the door  that actually outdoes argento  s flick .  br    br   are there any problems with the flick  hmmm . . . only minor ones . first  any scenes that aren  t following the murders or the budding romance between the two leads begin to bore . but just before you fall asleep  the killer will pop out of nowhere and you  ll be right back in the swing of things .  br    br   also  towards the end  the twists get a little too bizarre . i mean  what purpose did the scorpion pins really serve  if you don  t play close attention to the dialogue  you could easily become lost with the twisting  weaving storyline .  br    br   but these minor quibbles aside  la coda dello scorpione is a tense  suspenseful  classy and all around entertaining film for giallo fans . seek it out   ,1
spoiler warning .  br    br   when the main character  s sister is pushed down the stairs  the killer breaks a glass of vodka next to her  to make it appear that she  s been drinking . but right before she is killed  tells her sister  s business partner  teri garr  on the phone that she hasn  t had a drink in  days . yet the police never mention the results of a toxicology report  and  the characters talk about her being drunk when she fell down the stairs . huh  really bad mistake in this movie  which is pretty awful  overall .  br    br   surprisingly bad  considering the great cast . some faults the writing isn  t very good  the music is made  for  tv bad  and there is no tension at all because we already know the answer to the mystery from the first scene in the movie .  ,0
i want to state first that i am a christian  and that i do work in the film and tv industry  so i understand what it is like to work on a feature length film so props to the filmmakers in that regard . i  m all for positive  uplifting messages if they are true to the nature of life  that this is a fallen world and that things don  t always work out . . . even for followers of christ  . i  m glad that others are having such overwhelmingly positive reactions to the overt christian message for me it was just that the execution is where the film fell on its face . a movie lives and dies on its story and here you have one dimensional stereotypes  exposition aplenty  and spontaneous changes in character behavior that are inexplicably to say the least . i believe that a film does not have to club you over the head with its message to get the point across . i  m sure the kendrick bros . will improve with time and that their storytelling methods will as well . maybe they could direct someone else  s screenplay as their next project .  br    br    sports films are not exactly my first love but a good one  hoosiers  field of dreams  etc  can inspire in a multitude of ways . if you would be interested in a pg  rated film that inspires  give steven soderbergh  s  king of the hill  a look . all truth is god  s truth . . .  ,0
the lives of the saints starts off with an atmospheric vision of london as a bustling city of busy  quaint streets and sunshine . i was hoping it would maintain this atmosphere  but it gets bogged down in a story that goes pretty much nowhere .  br    br   othello works for big  fat mr . karva  his crime  boss step  dad  at least i think that is what he is supposed to be because it  s never really defined  but he does drop kittens into deep fat friers  so trust me  he  s a prick  doing scrappy little errands while his skanky girlfriend gives daddy hand  jobs . one of his colleagues is runner  a black dude who is always dashing from a to b . until the day he comes across almost mute homeless child who grants him his wish of being able to stop running . runner dumps the lost boy in othello  s flat  where he promptly starts granting more wishes . keen to have some of his own desires fulfilled  karva has the boy kidnapped . but he isn  t sure of what would really bring him happiness . is it the innocence of being a child again or is it another hand  job  either way  i don  t want to see the little boy grant him the second .  br    br   it just takes ages to get going and there are loads of repetitive scenes . the ending tries to be shocking but since there  s hardly any back  story on investment in any of these characters it only serves as a release for the bored audience .  br    br   writer tony grisoni  a favourite of terry gilliam  tries to blend in some kind of religious allegory which ends up being pretentious as all hell  ironically . if he gave us something more accessible or at least had better explanations for the characters suddenly acting all weird then it would have been a more enjoyable film . as it is  we are introduced to a bunch of annoying loudmouths who then miraculously seem to develop intelligence when confronted by the mysterious boy . who  s origins are never revealed . that  s just plain irritating   br    br   aside from sporadic moments of atmosphere and a moody score  this film has little to recommend .  ,0
this was a gem . amazing acting from the leads liam cunningham  orla brady and all the supporting cast . the movie raises a subject not only pertinent to ireland and irish history but to many communities around the world and many marriage units within those communities . with intensity and sincerity the movie shows how the religious convictions and traditions drove a wedge on a loving and passionate family . the title  love divided  couldn  t capture it any better . even though it was a true story and happening in ireland of the   th seeing how the life of the whole village erodes and  pogroms  are starting reminded me of russian history . the intolerance and prejudice are still too powerful in the world and unfortunately it  s deeply hidden inside the human nature . just like in the movie the liam cunningham  s character says  the hatred had always been there under the surface  . it was interesting to watch the moral choices people were making in this story . also the character of a catholic priest and what happened to him in the end of the story was quite meaningful . the story however gives hope that love of two people can conquer everything and love makes us better  stronger . liam cunningham  s character goes through the whole transformation in the course of the story becoming a man he always wanted to be . again acting is a top notch . story is fast  paced . irish countryside is as beautiful as ever . highly recommended .  ,1

i absolutely loved this movie . i bought it as soon as i could find a copy of it . this movie had so much emotion  and felt so real  i could really sympathize with the characters . every time i watch it  the ending makes me cry . i can really identify with busy phillip  s character  and how i would feel if the same thing had happened to me .  br    br   i think that all high schools should show this movie  maybe it will keep people from wanting to do the same thing . i recommend this movie to everybody and anybody . especially those who have been affected by any school shooting .  br    br   it truly is one of the greatest movies of all time .  ,1
michael curtiz directed this     very  stylish whodunit from a script by robert presnell sr .  robert n . lee and peter mine . the original novel they adapted was  the kennel murder case   perhaps from a writer  s standpoint the best of the philo vance mysteries by the strange s . s . van dine . vance was a long  worded and superior detective genius  and his character being assigned to william powell probably meant the executives at warner brothers were aware of the possibility that in less  engaging hands this detective might alienate viewers . fortunately they assigned suave william powell first to the character .  later he was played by basil rathbone  warren william  and paul lukas before being consigned to  b  picture status . the other question as always with warner brothers executives is why they chose vance as a character their penchant was to choose men who operated outside the law  with no apparent discrimination between a vicious murderer and a champion of individual rights against all comers . this film has a despicable villain who gets murdered  and a claustrophobically challenging locale inside an apartment complex . the characters are unarguably unusually well  realized  the direction rather good and unusually swift  paced and except for a darkish b  w look  the film avoids the comedic asides  superfluous characters and irrelevant dialogue characteristic of many early detective entries . jack okey did the good art direction . the music by berhard kaun is serviceable orry  kelly did the costumes . william reese provided the mostly  indoor cinematography . in the interesting cast  powell is the philo vance of his time  mostly sober  minded with just a hint of sardonic humor here and there . eugene palette is better than usual playing very straight as an admiring police partner to vance  with his very professional timing . the other actor who comes off best is handsome paul cavangh  very effective as always in what was written as a red herring part . mary astor is attractive but at this point in her career she talked a bit too fast to be as effective as she later proved . also in the cast were helen vinson as the villain  s woman  jack la rue  ralph morgan  best known as frank morgan  s brother   robert barrat as the villain everyone has cause to kill  archer coe  and frank conroy as his likable brother with robert mcwade as the d . a .  quirky and funny etiienne girardot has a delightfully witty part as the funny little forensics doctor who comes onto the crime scene . james lee as the abused chinese servant is excellent and intelligent . the story breaks into four parts . first there is shad doings at a dog show  where vance  coe and cavanagh are all showing west highland terriers . cavanagh  s dog is killed  by coe  to prevent him winning the title over his own entry . the second portion of the scene involves a leave  taking someone is confused enough by who has gone where  after coe parts from his girl friend  vinson  to murder his nice brother by mistake . enter vance  to find out who did in archer coe in a locked room and how  with the help of palette the romantic difficulties are straightened out  the chinese servant is exonerated  we find out who broke the expensive vase  who will marry whom  how archer coe was done in and why the butler did not do it   but someone else with a good excuse did . this is a more  than  good little mystery  which skilled hungarian  born director curtiz took quite seriously . he used wipes  swift cuts  changes of camera angle and alternations between straightforward and daring camera  work to achieve variety  interest and a sustained pace . many writers  critics and experts  myself included  consider this to be the best of the vance projects  although others are estimable as well .  ,1
a young woman  jean simmons  is convinced by her scheming and dangerous aunt  sonia dresdel  and uncle  barry jones  that she  s losing her mind and in very delicate condition that requires their supervision which turns out to be more like manipulation  as they try to keep her as far away from outside human contact as possible . the only other person she sees is the estate caretaker  a lascivious character played by maxwell reed  whose caught the wayward eye of the middle  aged aunt . all of this  the aunt and the caretaker  the butterfly expert uncle who has a serious underside to him  and the susceptible niece in the middle  would have made for a darker and more sinister film . as it is  a frame  up for a murder sends trevor howard  a fired government secret service agent who took a job at the estate cataloging butterflies  and simmons across the countryside escaping police  catching headlines of  police net closing in  over her front page photo  hopping on buses  and winding up in liverpool  where they meet some wonderfully cast characters  and finally face down the greedy and murderous aunt and uncle .  ,1
in so paulo  the upper middle class teenagers cristiano  chico and gabriel have just joined the university and on the eve of the opening class  they go to a party with drugs and booze . on the next day  after their classes  the date of cristiano in the previous night comes to his house and the three friends rape the girl . the girl dies  they panic and decide to get rid off the body  but cristiano  s mother arrives  startles with gabriel and rolls the staircase  breaking her neck . the trio decides to dump and burn the corpses in a garbage landfill  but along the night other tragedies happen .  br    br   the polemic and shameful  cama de gato  is an overrated pretentious crap about alienation of the youth  and is certainly the worst brazilian movie that i have seen along many years . the shallow  tragic and dark story is actually a black humor comedy of bad taste . the screenplay is not funny  with stupid lines and dialogs  and boring  manipulative and silly footages with interviews with morons teenagers in the beginning and in the end . the acting is terrible  apparently with many improvisations  but no talent  and i was disappointed with presence of the promising caio blat in this trash . the camera  framing  cinematography and edition are amateurish and of very low quality . the sound is awful and in many parts it is impossible to understand what the actors and actresses are speaking  probably it is a plus  since this flick sucks  . the gang bang is very realistic and used to promote this mediocre movie in a very poor marketing of sex  exploitation . my vote is one  awful  .  br    br   title  brazil    cama de gato    bed of the cat    ,0
i  d completely forgotten about this film until now . this was the most blatant and worst attempt to demonise a hobby that i have ever seen . it  s message seemed to be   don  t teenagers use their imagination they might take games seriously  go mad and hurt people .  i can only guess that the unimaginative writers of this piece thought that dd style games are form of evil ritual or arcane worship .  ,0
this film is hilarious  original   beautifully directed . i have become a big bad swim groupie  tracking it to film festivals whenever  wherever i can . i  ve seen it about half a dozen times now   each time  enthusiastic audience response has confirmed my feeling that this is one of the best films to come out in years . at nearly every festival it has screened  it has either sold out  or won the audience favorite award . it  s clear that people love this film   even clearer why they do . the cinematography is superb  the characterization  acting brilliant  the ending fantastic   the direction filled with compassion  wisdom  the art of perfect timing . it  s hard to believe this is ishai setton  s first film . i hope it will be released soon so everyone can see it .  ,1
from the moment christopher lee puts on a pair of punk sunglasses and tries to sneak into a punk rock club  you know you  ve got a stinker on your hands  this film had potential . beneath all of the sludge there are the remnants of what could have been crafted into a decent film  if not an interesting one . the final product is a real mess  however . aside from the gratuitous nudity and some very attractive women  howling ii winds up being a laughable excuse for a horror film . christopher lee gives it a nugget of credibility  but even he cannot raise it above the level of crap .  br    br   having never seen any of the other films in this series  this critic will be forced to accept on face value that this is a genuine continuation of the events in part one . we start off at a funeral for one of the characters from the original  and within the first ten minutes we find ourselves in transylvania with a small group of heroes ready to battle a coven of werewolves . the film is paced fairly well  and there are not too many dead spots . the action is there it just isn  t filmed well . one bright spot is the music of a punk band called babel . though their song is played quite often  it is rather catchy .  br    br   the problems with this film are great in number . first off  the acting is worse than pitiful . christopher lee is good enough  but that  s where it ends . the two leads reb brown and annie mcenroe are lacking in just about everything you  d want for such characters . the writing is wretched  the editing redundant  and the direction amateurish . there are a couple nice special effect gimmicks  but the cheesy ones far out weigh them in number . sybil danning is nice to look at  but her acting performance is less than satisfactory . judd omen looks the part he plays  but his voice and acting are unconvincing to say the least . much of the dialog is in an unintelligible language that may or may not be latin .  br    br   i liked the general idea for the story . i always enjoy stories of true believers out to battle seemingly invincible forces of evil . one scene where a small group of good guys are trekking through a dark forest and shooting down a bunch of werewolves is even kind of exciting . kind of . maybe a bigger budget or a better director could have made the rest of the film a bit more compelling .  of   stars .  br    br   the hound .  br    br   side note as of this writing  the censors at youtube . com have still not taken down the ending credits with sybil danning ripping off her top several times while the babel song is playing  catch it while you can   ,0
the waiting womans ward of a large lying  in hospital  with all its joys and sorrows  is the place where life begins .  br    br   this nearly forgotten drama is a fine little soap opera  replete with comedy and tragedy  all tied into the lives of the maternity staff and their patients . the frankness with which the subject matter is handled points up the movie  s pre  code status .  br    br   marvelous aline macmahon  as the sympathetic head nurse  is the calm center of the film  the rock around which all the currents flow . able to handle any crisis or emergency  she is the mothers  best  sometimes last  friend . surrounding macmahon is a bevy of excellent costars loretta young as a convicted murderess released from prison long enough to give birth eric linden as her frightened young husband brassy glenda farrell as a dame who hates children sweet clara blandick as a very mature mother in for her sixth birthing preston foster  hale hamilton as thoughtful  compassionate doctors and frank mchugh as a comically frantic father  to  be .  br    br   movie mavens will recognize bobs watson as a wee tyke who wants to see the stork paul fix as a nervous husband who promises to behave like a little soldier  gilbert roland as a distraught italian husband and elizabeth patterson as a snooty doctor  s wife interested in adopting farrell  s son  all uncredited .  br    br   there are a few absurdities in the plot  some of the mothers are obviously much too old farrell becomes blatantly drunk in the ward but none of the staff seem to notice an obviously psychotic patient is able to wander around at will  but this really only enhances the quirky entertainment value of the film and keeps things from becoming too serious .  ,1
hubert selby jr . gave us the book  requiem for a dream  and co  wrote the screenplay to aronofsky  s movie of it . that movie succeeded on every level by delivering an intimate  and unbiased portrait of the horrors of the characters lives and the vices that destroyed them .  last exit to brooklyn  still has the vice and the multiple characters living sad lives  but it hardly does them the same justice aronofsky did .  br    br   the film seems laughably anti  gay at times . especially when in the film homosexuality equals death . one gay character gets stoned  is launched skyward by a speeding car  and lands dead on the pavement . another is crucified and still more are simply beat up . another exaggerated piece of shock value  that might actually have been compelling if it were done well  are scenes of the union workers literally doing battle with the strike  breakers . who  d have thought a drama about brooklyners would feature action sequences and truck explosions   br    br   the director  uli edel has a skill level like that of a tv director  but he is far below the cut for real movies . the film is clunky that can  t even seem to settle on a genre . lake is given a useless role that any mannequin could have filled and baldwin only seems to know how to look stupid in his equally meager part . and then comes jennifer jason leigh as our lead  a loathsome hooker named tralala  believe it or not  i  m not joking  . her performance is nothing great and the fate of her character is dirty to say the least . poor use of color and composition make it look cheaper than it is  and also takes the  real  edge off the more provocative bits . a failure .  ,0
after watching two of his silent shorts   elena and her men        is my first feature  length film from french director jean renoir  and i quite enjoyed it . however  i didn  t watch the film for renoir  but for star ingrid bergman  who  at age    still radiated unsurpassed beauty  elegance and charm . throughout the early     s  following her scandalous marriage to italian roberto rossellini  bergman temporarily fell out of public favour . her next five films  directed by her husband  were unsuccessful in the united states  and i suspect that renoir  s latest release did little to enhance bergman  s popularity with english  speaking audiences however  she did regain her former success with an oscar in the same year  s  anastasia         . she stars as elena sokorowska  a polish princess who sees herself as a guardian angel of sorts  bringing success and recognition to promising men everywhere  before promptly abandoning them . while working her lucky charms to aid the political aspirations of the distinguished general francois rollan  jean marais   she finds herself falling into a love that she won  t be able to walk away from . this vaguely  political film works well as either a satire or a romantic comedy  as long as you don  t take it too seriously it  s purely lighthearted romantic fluff .  br    br   filmed in vibrant technicolor   elena and her men  looks terrific as well  a flurry of bright colours  characters and costumes . bergman  s polish princess is dreamy and somewhat self  absorbed  not in an unlikable way  but hardly a woman of high principles and convictions . she is persuaded by a team of bumbling government conspirators to convince general rollan to stage a coup d  tat  knowingly exploiting his love for her in order to satisfy her own delusions as a  guardian angel .  perhaps the film  s only legitimately virtuous character is henri de chevincourt  mel ferrer  then audrey hepburn  s husband   who ignores everybody else  s selfish secondary motives and pursues elena for love  and love alone . this  renoir proudly suggests  is what the true french do best .  elena and her men  also attempts  with moderate success  to expose the superficiality of upper  class french liaisons  through the clumsy philandering of eugne  jacques jouanneau   who can  t make love to his servant mistress without his fianc walking in on them . for these sequences  renoir was obviously trying for the madcap sort of humour that you might find in a marx brothers film  but the film itself is so relaxed and laid  back that the energy just isn  t there .  ,1
i have always had the philosophy that every single human being has different tastes  i found this movie to be awesome and i think every college student out there might agree with me . notwithstanding this is not a  movie with a plot   its about real guys and some of the  problems  that they face . i found the movie hilarious  especially the parts that they played the practical jokes on each other  . simply put  if you are in the same  wave  length  as these people  you will find this movie amazing . i don  t think that this is going win any golden globes or oscars  or that the people in this movie will become future hollywood stars  but its a kind of  cult  classic  among young people who could relate to their experience . for me the guy that stands out the most is hans the scandinavian guy  who  according to him  isnt a looker   but gets all  or some  of the chicks . the  little  people  also play a big part in the movie  especially when they are drunk . if i keep going  i might provide a spoiler and i don  t want to do that  just go and get the movie and you will not regret . i give it a      ,1
this was a fabulous adaptation of jane eyre . the only problem i had with it was that i didn  t like zelah clarke . i thought she was too old and made jane seem much to timid . in the book jane seemed like a much stronger character . i was really annoyed by this portrayal of her . the part where it  s the morning after rochester asks her to marry him and she runs up to him and hugs him always makes me laugh . i think they made a bad choice in casting her . but dalton was absolutely wonderful as rochester . he makes this version of jane eyre worth seeing . another thing that made this version not quite     was the quality of film . i know it was made in the eighties for tv . if it had been a feature film  and better quality  it would have been perfect . my main complaint however  is that zelah clarke was definitely too old .  ,1
ostensibly a film that predicts the coming trends in british popular music  it  s wrong on so many fronts that it  s laughable . tommy quickly  the honeycombs  the movie does include a song by the spencer davis group  two by the animals  and one tacked on live film of the beatles doing their live version of twist and shout  all      . but all in all  an awkward display of british music circa     . oh  and herman  s hermits .  ,0
you know how sometimes you can watch a crappy movie with friends and laugh at all the shortcomings of the movie  well this was beyond that . i bought the dvd at tower records because it was like   .   and i  d heard this was a movie you could laugh at . it is really nothing short of pathetic . about   minutes into the movie  my friends started asking me to turn it off . around   minutes they begged me . after an hour  we compromised to fast forward to the end  so we could see how the conflict was resolved  and because we had been watching the whole time for matt walsh  . seriously  don  t watch this movie . it is beyond painful .  ,0
the acting in this movie was superb  but mixed with the truth about the condition of many africans in south africa made it heart wrenching . it was good that the writer isolated boesman and lena from others run from their homes  so we could share fully in their triumphs and defeats the conflicts they shared as they grew together and apart . worth seeing when you put the movie in it  s proper context .  ,1
obsession comes in many flavors  and exists for a variety of reasons for some it may be nothing more than a compulsive disorder  but for others it may be an avenue of survival . lack of nurturing  combined with an inability to negotiate even the simplest necessities of daily life or the basic social requirements  may compel even a genius to enthusiastically embrace that which provides a personal comfort zone . and in extreme cases  the object of that satisfaction may become a manifested obsession  driving that individual on until what began as a means of survival becomes the very impetus of his undoing  and as we discover in the luzhin defence   directed by marleen gorris  a high level of intelligence will not insure a satisfactory resolution to the problem  and in fact  may actually exacerbate the situation . obsession  it seems  has no prejudice or preference moreover  it gives no quarter .  br    br   at an italian resort in the      s  alexander luzhin  john turturro  is one of many who have gathered there for a chess tournament  the winner of which will be the world champion . luzhin is a master of the game  but he is vulnerable in that chess has long since ceased to be a game to him rather  it is his obsession  that one thing discovered in childhood that saw him though his total ineptness in seemingly all areas of life  and enabled him to cope with the subtle disenfranchisements of his immediate family . so luzhin is a genius with an achilles heel  a flaw which perhaps only one other person knows about and understands  and furthermore realizes can be exploited for his own personal gain at this very tournament . that man is valentinov  stuart wilson   luzhin  s former mentor  who after an absence of some years has suddenly reappeared and made himself known to luzhin .  br    br   valentinov is an unwelcomed  disconcerting presence to luzhin  and once again life threatens to overwhelm him . not only is he about to face a formidable opponent in the tournament  turati  fabio sartor   against whom in a previous match he emerged with a draw after fourteen hours  but he is also attempting to resolve a new element in his life   his feelings for a young woman he  s just met at the resort  natalia  emily watson  . and  genius though he may be  dark clouds are gathering above him that just may push luzhin even deeper into the obsession that has been the saving grace  as well the curse  of his entire life .  br    br   to tell luzhin  s story  gorris effectively uses flashbacks to gradually reveal the elements of his childhood that very quickly led to his obsession with chess . and as his background is established  it affords the insights that allow the audience to more fully understand who luzhin is and how he got to this point in his life . for the scenes of his childhood  gorris textures them with an appropriately dark atmosphere and a subtle sense of foreboding that carries on into  and underlies  the present  more pastoral setting of the resort . the transitions through which she weaves the past together with the present are nicely handled  and with the pace gorris sets it makes for a riveting  yet unrushed presentation that works extremely well . she also underplays the menace produced by the presence of valentinov  concentrating on the drama rather than the suspense  which ultimately serves to heighten the overall impact of the film  making luzhin  s tragedy all the more believable and unsettling .  br    br   the single element that makes this film so memorable  however  is the affecting performance of john turturro . for this film to work  luzhin must be absolutely believable one false or feigned moment would be disastrous  as it would take the viewer out of the story immediately . it doesn  t happen  however  and the film does work  because the luzhin turturro creates is impeccably honest and true  to  life . he captures luzhin  s genius  as well as his inadequacies  and presents his character in terms that are exceptionally telling and very real . it  s a performance equal to  if not surpassing  geoffrey rush  s portrayal of david helfgott in shine .  and when you compare his work here with other characters he  s created  from sid lidz in unstrung heroes  to pete in o brother where art thou   to al fountain in box of moonlight   you realize what an incredible range turturro has as an actor  and what a remarkable artist he truly is .  br    br   as natalia  emily watson is excellent  as well  turning in a fairly reserved performance through which she develops and presents her character quite nicely . though she has to be somewhat outgoing to relate to luzhin  watson manages to do it in an introspective way that is entirely effective . most importantly  because of the detail she brings to her performance  it makes her accelerated relationship with luzhin believable and lends total credibility to the story . you have but to look into watson  s eyes to know that the feelings she  s conveying are real . it  s a terrific bit of work from a talented and gifted actor .  br    br   the supporting cast includes geraldine james  vera   christopher thompson  stassard   peter blythe  ilya   orla brady  anna   mark tandy  luzhin  s father   kelly hunter  luzhin  s mother   alexander hunting  young luzhin  and luigi petrucci  santucci  . well crafted and delivered  the luzhin defence  is an emotionally involving film  presented with a restrained compassion that evokes a sense of sorrow and perhaps a reflection upon man  s inhumanity to man . we don  t need a movie  of course  to tell us that there is cruelty in the world but we are well served by the medium of the cinema when it reminds us of something we should never forget  inasmuch as we all have the ability to effect positive change  and to make a difference in the lives of those around us . i rate this one     .  br    br    br    br    br    br    ,1
star rating  saturday night  friday night  friday morning  sunday night  monday morning  br    br   marshall lawson  steven seagal  is assigned to france on a reconaissance mission along with three new young strike  team recruits after disobeying a direct order from above . however the night before they  re due to strike  they are all found grusomely slaughtered by a killer with seemingly inhuman strength . with the french police dallying around with their own investigation  he goes in search of those responsible himself  only to uncover a corrupt faction of the military dealing in a deadly new drug that alters a person  s dna and gives them terrifying new strength .  br    br   bad cover . bad title . bad post  production tampering . and bad trailer . pretty bad film . but  i  ve got to say  i don  t think attack force is quite his worst . i know this will make me unpopular with most of the other reviewers here  perhaps not steveday   but i think a lot of the criticism has stemmed from all the bad news that went before the film rather than the actual quality of it itself .  br    br   i must say there was nowhere near as much dubbing or ropey editing as i  d been lead to believe . the dubbing there was  which made him sound like martin sheen with a groin problem   was pretty awful and quite frequent but not in use for as large a segment of the film as i  d thought . the plot flowed pretty smoothly as well considering all the messing about with the original finished film called harvester that went on . also as another reviewer noted  the film has a nice gothic look to it  a new touch for a seagal film .  br    br   the absolute killer low point  though  was the complete and total lack of any exciting action  with only a few poorly filmed fight scenes for any fun .  br    br   i have to be honest  though  i would rather watch this again than flight of fury  today you die or out for a kill .   ,0
this film is really only bill maher  s interpretation of religion . there are several funny moments  and some interesting points  but don  t go into this expecting an even  handed discussion of religion . this is what i consider to be the worst kind of documentary  everything is arranged ahead of time and in editing to provide you with the opinion of the director  rather than letting you make your own decision .  br    br   editing  it  s very chopped up  inter  spliced with clips from pop culture and the media to reinforce the point . the interviewee barely has a chance to finish a sentence before he is interrupted by the editing . the only people given a fair chance to speak their mind are those who say what bill maher wants them to say . once someone deviates from the gospel according to maher  they get edited .  br    br   interviewees  they are meant to represent the absolute most extremist religions . from the tv evangelical to the ultimate jewish stereotype  to a truck stop chapel  seriously . a truck stop chapel  . he  s picked the worst money  grabbers  the heavy extremists  and those who don  t have the budget to say no to pick on . and when he does get a good person to interview  he edits the hell out of them .  br    br   stereotyping  all religions are portrayed as stereotypes . especially hard hit are the muslims . during the muslim segment  he barely gives anyone the chance to speak before interrupting them either himself  or through editing in pieces with suicide bombers . all muslims are portrayed as gun  toting extremists through the editing  and none of the people interviewed is edited fairly .  br    br   ending  the message at the end is incredibly heavy  handed  and while it is an interesting idea  it  s not presented with fairness to the countless people who are not religious extremists . bill maher explains himself while clips of destruction play in the foreground . this literally gives the message that religion is stupid and dangerous  and that it will destroy the world . he also states that everyone involved in religion is stupid .  br    br   with the faults to the film  it has some good points  and the humor  while very unfair  is actually funny . but know going in  it is a very one  sided view  bill maher  s view  of religion . he  s not discovering anything . he  s telling you what he thinks .  br    br        some good moments  but heavy  handed with an extremely irresponsible documentary style .  ,0

i  m a big fan of westerns but this one . . . . whew  what a stinker  i think what turned me off almost right off the bat was the inane dialog . i think i could have written better dialog than this when i was in eighth grade . and the poor actors  given this terrible dialog  none of them came across looking anything but ridiculous . really  i  m not kidding . some of this is little better than what you  d get in an ed wood film .  br    br   the biggest tragedy is sterling hayden . he was probably the  big  star in this movie which if you called it a b  western  you  d be lavishing praise upon it . this is what should be called a b  minus western perhaps . pity sterling hayden  who appeared at other times along with joan crawford  bette davis  frank sinatra  and other major talents . for him to appear in a vehicle this poor must have been something he tried to downplay for the rest of his life .  br    br   one annoying thing about this movie is all the men look like they haven  t shaved in a week and their faces are all greasy . i know in the old west guys weren  t always well groomed but to a man this is a movie that makes you want to just go  ewwww   really  this is a crummy western . denver pyle also had to live this one down  especially after appearances in so many great westerns . bad  bad movie .  ,0
well what can i say  there are b  grade movies and there are b  grade movies and this definitely falls into the latter . however since it  s obvious that even the makers of the film know that it  s not a credible movie  take a look at the closing credits  it can be forgiven .  br    br   the plot is basically a convicted psycho killer is killed . he accidentally has his genetic material mixed up with some experimental acid that get combined and then lost in the snow . the killer now takes on the form of a snowman  if you can believe that . the snowman  jack frost  is after the country town sherif who put him behind bars . in doing so  jack frost ends up killing half the town .  br    br   this movie lacks any real scares and the effects alone remind me of the b  grade movies of the    s . this alone makes it worth watching for a laugh . a movie to pass the time away .  ,0
it is amazing to me what passes for entertainment today . maybe i am a dinosaur from the fifties  and i am out of touch with todays movie going generation  and apparently that is the case with regards to this movie  since so many people loved it . i found it foul and vulgar . i haven  t said that about many movies in my life but this one fits the bill . the humor is sophomoric and crude . i am not a politically correct person  and even i found the gay jokes  not only not funny but downright offensive  i  m not gay  . the main character in the movie is not even a likable person  just pathetic . when the movie was finally over i heard a number of people comment on how disappointed they were in what they had just pay good money to see .  ,0
the premise is simple . this movies starts out looking like your average lame chick flick about two attractive young people meeting each other in an airport  then things take a    degree turn . . .  br    br   i for one  really dislike the kind of mind numbing love story nonsense that pollutes the average movie theater . and it is my humble opinion that wes craven  based on his previous meta  horror films  sceam  does too . . .  br    br   following this logic  it  s not surprising to find that craven sardonically takes his time to built up a nauseatingly sweet  sependipity love   story  only to have an awesome cillian murphy wreck that whole sugar  coated dreamworld . . .  br    br   the scope of his character jackson ripner  jack the ripper  get it  lame  right   in this film is impressive  he goes from being utterly charming to being a twisted nihilistic sicko  which is a plus in my book . as he proceeds to freak out his victim  jennifer garner lookalike rachel mcadams  who i found pretty annoying by the way   you can  t help but sympathize with the guy . . .  br    br   this is wes craven  embodied in jackson ripner  through cillian murphy  bashing all brainless chick flicks . . .  br    br   mr . craven  i salute you .  br    br   best quote  br    br   jackson ripner  after beating the snot out of rachel mcadams in the airplane toilet    thanks for the quickie      ,1
in a movie that follows a struggling actor  played  evidently  by a struggling actor  this does no favours for chris klein . he struggles to bring anything memorable to the role and meanders on through the shallow script managing to display  what could only be described as  a bland leading man . the story exists  but that is all  and fails to show any basic start  middle and end and the viewer is left shrugging his shoulders feeling as though nothing in the past hour and three quarters has really happened .  br    br   one bright light in the midst of this is fred durst  who manages to stand out above his seemingly averagely talented co  stars and does a semi  decent job of bringing the backward character of legde to life . whether fred can re  create this when working with a higher calibre of cast remains to be seen but i  l be watching out for him in future .  ,0
i found it highly interesting that the film actually managed to bridge the gap between my own american culture and that of the originators  i . e . chinese . it becomes a story about values  and causes the watcher to reevaluate their own choices in life  and loyalties toward institutions . amazingly enough  it managed to do this in a gentle  mildly humorous manner  which only in retrospect seens threatening to one  s status quo . i enjoyed the movie  and would watch it again if i could .  ,1
hip . erotic . wickedly sexy . . . whatever . it  s  the terminator  with werewolves .  br    br   no  seriously . the cop saves the girl  waitress   from the big monster and refers to himself as her  protector  . the lead actor ryan alosio does a pretty good job of emulating kyle reese . . . there  s a massacre in a police precinct . . . the bad guy is muscular with red eyes . . . and it even contains dialogue along the lines of  you said it yourself  he won  t ever stop . never .  the dire script comes from a first  time screenwriter who  thank god  hasn  t sold anything since this  and it  s all thrown together by famously bad director richard friedman .  br    br   the movie opens in a strip bar  always a good sign   and a mean  looking biker guy bursts in for no apparent reason  pursued by three cops . one of them is black  and  shock horror   he  s the one who gets killed in the first five minutes . the film goes downhill for the next hour or so  then picks up a little with some decent action sequences  before rounding it all up with an abysmal ending .  br    br   for the most part  the cast come across as competent actors doing what they can with a bad script and a director who  s willing to settle for less . if nothing else they appear to be learning how to act in this movie and alosio  along with some of the supporting cast  shows signs of talent . darkwolf in his human form is played by gargantuan kane hodder   famous for his numerous portrayals of jason vorhees in the  friday the   th  movies . he  s decent enough  especially considering he isn  t used to speaking roles .  br    br   it  s become famous amongst groups of horny teenage boys for the lesbian rooftop scene between andrea bogart and sasha williams  who gets her kit off a couple of times in the grand tradition of former  power rangers  actresses . and it  s unnervingly clear that the editor spent way too much time on that scene . . . anyway  the main redeeming feature is that the physical werewolf effects are rather good  and the design of the wolf isn  t bad at all . but the cgi is bad . just plain bad . i mean seriously  if you can  t reach some level of realism  why bother  just throw a little extra money into the make  up  aside from the terrible script  this movie does have it  s moments  many of which are unintentionally funny . it  s good for a laugh if you don  t have anything better to do  but just don  t spend any money on it . please .  ,0
christopher smith is an obvious horror fan and this is made clear in his debut horror flick  creep  .  creep  although a little bit loose on information  proves itself worthy of a true gory classic . a little less glossy than recent us horrors  amityville horror remake  house of wax remake  this dark and gruesome tale follows kate  franka potente  through the labyrinth of underground tunnels and disused railways as she  and a number of others along the way  try and flee a murderous attacker . though some bad reviews have slated this film  i truly believe that on a tight budget and for a uk production from first time director smith that  creep  truly does live up to its name . it delivers fast  paced gory action more or less from the beginning  sometimes too fast as the story is patchy in some areas  but with a perfect location and the best character  reaction  at  the  end i  ve seen in a while   creep  delivers some scenes that are definitely the stuff of nightmares .  ,1

this ludicrous and inept film is certainly the most misguided version of  hamlet  to ever reach the screen . branagh  s approach to the material can only be described as vulgar going to such lengths as depicting ophelia in a straight jacket  having fortinbras  army appear suddenly on the horizon  looking very much like the climax of  monty python and the holy grail   when the palace is apparently guarded only by francisco  who shouts the very un  shakespearean cry of  ataaaaaaaaaaaaaaaack  before being gunned down   and multitudes of star cameos that harken back to the days of jimmy cagney  s bottom and mary pickford  s kate .  br    br   branagh chose to set his film in an edwardian setting but at the same time decided to employ an almost uncut text  so that frequently the dialogue that is firmly rooted in elizabethan mentality makes no sense in the context that it is being performed . and branagh does not concern himself with such textural subtleties as the ambiguous nature of hamlet and olphelia  s relationship  treating the audience to a vulgar nude sex scene between the couple that tosses any ambiguity right out the stained glass window .  br    br   the uncut text does allow branagh to indulge in his favorite cinematic pastime more footage of kenneth branagh . this is never so apparent as in the  how all occasions inform against me  speech that ends the first half of the nineteen hour film  at least that  s how it feels   which attempts to play to a dramatic crescendo along the lines of gone with the wind  s  i  ll never be hungry again .  this may serve branagh  s ego  but it does not serve shakespeare or the speech when i saw the film in the theater  i leaned over to my companion and snickered  great moments with mr . hamlet .  branagh saves the funniest and most tasteless moment for last  when he attempts to out  do the olivier film and its justly celebrated death of claudius by having hamlet jump from off a high tower onto the monarch  impaling him with a sword . branagh  s dane does in the king by heroically throwing an apparently magic rapier from across the palace to run through claudius  heart with a super hero  s bulls eye . the only thing that saved the moment from being unbearably maddening was that it was so off  the  wall funny .  br    br   while this film has been praised in some quarters as a serious depiction of the tragedy  it is in fact nothing but a star  studded display of a once  talented filmmaker being overtaken by his own narcissism . the emperor has no clothes  and this hamlet has nothing to offer but a few unintended laughs and the appalling sight of one man  s ego out of control .  ,0

this is a sublime piece of film  making . it flows at just the right pace throughout . the accompanying music fits perfectly and is very pleasant to the ear . the humorous parts are hilarious and made even more so by the largely depressingly tragic nature of the film .  br    br   however  despite much comment about the inherent tragedy of the storyline it was anything but depressing for me to watch . i thoroughly enjoyed it in a way that i haven  t experienced for a long time . that is to say  it is superb and yet without all the common trappings of modern films such as sex  violence and unnecessary special effects .  br    br    dan in real life  lacks nothing for being without the regular vices . it has a fully matured plot that just doesn  t require  and indeed would be ruined by  any further embellishment . at the same time  the theme is entirely adult . it  s a piece of art in and of itself that encapsulates you entirely and you want for nothing more than it already offers .  br    br   there are some scenes that feel a bit  waltons  but these actually make perfect sense in the long run as they contrast the more dysfunctional moments . the rosier makes way for the tragic which then gives over to the idyllic which turns to the darker etc . this undulating landscape of emotional cinematography creates a perfect balance and keeps the viewer in a state of lithium  like stability . the peaks and troughs are gentle but more than adequate in the pleasure they instill .  br    br   i highly recommend watching this film regardless of what genre you normally enjoy . put aside any prejudices because this is a must see   ,1
connie hoffman is very pretty and is attractively topless at times .  br    br   that  s it  folks . the sole reason for even considering whether to watch this film or not .  br    br   these   s sexploitation period pieces are sometimes entertaining by virtue of their very datedness  flared trousers  big hair  zapata moustaches etc .  . this one isn  t .  br    br   the script is bad  the acting is bad  the direction is bad  and the idea of having a senior citizen romantic leading man is exceptionally bad .  br    br   the title  hinting at a sex comedy  is grossly misleading .  br    br   i heartily recommend avoiding this one like the plague .  ,0
breathtaking  this is without doubt the best anime cartoon ever made . i first saw castle in the sky in the late   s as a child and it left a lasting impression . years went by and i forgot the title of the film  and only by chance browsing on the internet i found this masterpiece again . after reading other peoples reviews and analysis i  m not surprised it has such acclaim and touched so many because it does leave an impression . a true fantasy adventure  a must see for all children and adults . its best not giving the story away so i would say watch this movie will a clear and open mind . if you have kids treat them to this i promise you they will love it . there  s not much to say about this piece of art but if you  ve not seen it watch it and enjoy .  ,1
i  ve seen about four other japanese horror films and they weren  t too impressive . however  i could sense that there was a sensible script guiding the way .  br    br   not here  no way . this is about a detective who is trying to tie together similar murders that have been happening . when he finds a suspect to question  the suspect freaks out because they keep seeing a ghost . then  the ghost starts to follow the detective around for a reason that is never explained and takes up more than half of the movie .  br    br   bad enough  oh no . the film keeps switching perspectives to different characters who don  t have much to do with the story . i  ve seen this before in other movies where it shows a different perspective . not the case here .  br    br   also  whatever is happening on screen that is actually tolerable quickly ends . for example  there a few scenes with a slight instrumental score that builds up and . . . then it just cuts to another scene . i  m aware that this can be a dramatic effect . that  s definitely not the intention here . it  s just bad editing .  br    br   finally  there  s the  ghost  who just screams in a way that  s not scary or unintentionally funny . it  s annoying and it happens a lot throughout the movie .  br    br   all of the scares have been done before in better ways so you can see them all coming . then after one of them  the movie is over . at that point  a wave of confusion swept over the audience as i could sense we all felt that we had wasted our time . someone did a mock clap and laughter ensued . it was better than the whole film . simply put  avoid .  ,0
this is a great movie to see with your girlfriend . my friend and i both love dance and ran into this movie at the video store . we had to get it . with no violence and such a warming story its a great movie to relax to and just enjoy your night . i would recommend this movie to any family or just a bunch of girls looking for a cute movie .  ,1
to movie  this movie felt like one of those after school specials  only lower budget and lower everything else . i guess this was supposed to an inspirational movie of some sort  but it didn  t work for me . yet some how it comes across as preachy . it has very pale shades of flash dance  but so what  there just isn  t any excitement in this movie . the dialogue is contrived and clichd to death . of course  the whole movie feels like a bad    s clich . the acting was less than stellar  though that has a lot to do with what the actors were given  or in this case  not  to work with . on top of that is the poor song choices  with really bad lyrics . i felt embarrassed for all the actors involved . they are all talented  but you can  t tell from this movie . this is just my opinion of course  but i have to give flying aka dream to believe a      ,0
there is not a speck of entertainment in this entire film . there  s not one scary  funny  or even interesting scene in this film . it advertises itself as a horror  then goes on to call itself a comedy . it doesn  t even attempt humor . neither does it attempt to be scary .  br    br   in order to not be bored by this film  you would have to be one of the most easily entertained people on earth . if you like this movie even a little bit than you have no standard for what you watch at all . i  m having a very difficult time trying to understand what the filmmakers were trying to accomplish with this . its not funny  scary  shocking  or intriguing . so was it supposed to be a drama  because it really wasn  t dramatic either .  br    br   please just do yourself a favor and don  t watch this film . life is too precious to be wasting   minutes of it watching this .  ,0
i first saw this movie back in the      s and now in     this movie still is one of the best movies i have ever seen  i would recommend anyone to look at this movie . you will not be sorry . it is well acted out  so real and never a dull moment . the acting is superb and the location makes the movie seem like you are there . from the beginning right up to the end  this movie is the type that makes you lose your attention . the actress does an excellent job of portraying the girl who survived this horrific plane crash in the amazon and it shows how she managed to survive in the amazon all alone . it is unbelievable that anyone could survive under such conditions . this is why this movie is so appealing . the fact that this is a true story makes the movie even more interesting and to think that a young girl could survive from this ordeal is overwhelming . i find this movie one that i can watch over and over again and one that i never get tired of . this is indeed quite a compliment as i have hundreds of movies  i would say this is probably my favorite movie and the best i have ever seen   ,1
i have loved this movie since i first saw it in     . i  m still amazed at how accurately kurt russell portrays elvis  right down to how he moves and the expressions on his face . sometimes its scary how much he looks  acts  and talks like the real elvis . thankfully this is being released on dvd  so all of us that have been waiting can finally have an excellent quality version of the full length film . i have heard the detractors  who say that there are some inaccuracies  or some things left out  but i think that keeping in mind that john carpenter only had about     hours to work with  and that this was being shown on television  just two years after elvis  s death   that he did a fine job with this . in fact i haven  t seen another elvis movie that even comes close to this one . highly recommended .  ,1
in     dick powell and ruby keeler sang and danced their way through three warner brother musicals that offered depression era audiences a momentary distraction from their woes . gold diggers of        nd street and footlight parade were all set in the world of broadway theatre with basically the same theme of the show must go on . in addition to keeler and powell the films featured the kaleidiscopic choreography of busby berkeley  show stopping tunes and many of the same supporting players .  br    br   all are arguably classics of their genre but i must admit a clear preference for footlight due to it  s pace energy and lead james cagney . warren william in gold diggers and warner baxter in   nd street acquit themselves admirably as the shows production heads  particularly baxter as the burned out julian marsh in search of one last box office smash . both lack the infectious energy of cagney however  who perfectly compliments the frenetic pace of putting on a broadway musical . he is an absolute whirlwind as he deals with production numbers  unscrupulous partners and a gold digging girlfriend .  br    br   of course cagney alone does not make footlight the classic that it is . the script crackles with some sharp double entendres delivered by a superlative supporting cast featuring frank mchugh  hugh herbert  guy kibbee and especially joan blondell who cuts everyone down to size . busby berkeley  s dance numbers are surreal  suggestive and risqu and done just in the nick of time before the arrival of the hollywood code in   . sadly  the thirties and sometime beyond would never see such a richly made musical with the verve and sass of footlight again . gentility and morality made sure of it .  ,1
when we started watching this series on cable  i had no idea how addictive it would be . even when you hate a character  you hold back because they are so beautifully developed  you can almost understand why they react to frustration  fear  greed or temptation the way they do . it  s almost as if the viewer is experiencing one of christopher  s learning curves .  br    br   i can  t understand why adriana would put up with christopher  s abuse of her  verbally  physically and emotionally  but i just have to read the newspaper to see how many women can and do tolerate such behavior . carmella has a dream house  endless supply of expensive things  but i  m sure she would give it up for a loving and faithful husband  or maybe not . that  s why i watch .  br    br   it doesn  t matter how many times you watch an episode  you can find something you missed the first five times . we even watch episodes out of sequence  watch season  on late night with commercials but all the language  ae with language censored  reruns on the movie network   whenever they  re on  we  re there . we  ve been totally spoiled now .  br    br   i also love the malaprop  s .  an albacore around my neck  is my favorite of johnny boy . when these jewels have entered our family vocabulary  it is a sign that i should get a life . i will when the series ends  and i have collected all the dvd  s  and put the collection in my will .  ,1
myself and my groovadelic    something pals just can  t get enough of this awesome parker posey classic  i tried renting this on dvd  but can  t seem to find it  too bad  as i  m sure the features would be  extra special      we all highly recommend this uber  cool comedy flickerino for a date  or even just a cozy night home alone  this would also be the purr  fect type of movie to watch with your cat  or even throw a party based on  like a  party girl  party  just like the one in the movie that the lovable  huggable  squeezable parker posey goes to at the end . oh  and be on the lookout for a gripping and hilarious surprise ending . . . move aside  the sixth sense  you  ve just been outdone by a way radder movie  sorry  no offense  just calling it like it is  take it from an old flick lover  comedy just doesn  t get better than  party girl  with parker p  feel it  yours  ronald marie macdougall  aka dj cyber  rap   ,1
plan b has the appearance of a quickly made  unedited  sloppy script for a movie with the attempt for an outing for the actors involved  an outing that should have been nixed from the start . it is just another mafia  based  comedy  that has nothing new and lowers the standard for those participating .  br    br   joe maloni  paul sorvino  is the crime boss more concerned about clothing and appearances than about his business of control . his personal assistant mario  anthony desando  is dumber than dirt and his ignorance is supposed to be funny . maloni has whacked one of his debtors  who just happens to be married to bookish fran  diane keaton  and maloni takes fran on as his assistant to work off her dead husband  s debt by being maloni  s  hit man  . fran is afraid of her own shadow and is unable to carry out maloni  s assignments  electing instead to transport her  whackees  to florida to hide at her brother james  house until she can figure out what to do next . this alternative to killing the three candidates is called plan b  plan a being to kill them  the ending is wholly predictable just as is every line assigned in the script to the characters .  br    br   diane keaton has made a lot of fine films and is one of our most talented actresses and comediennes  but here she screams and rants and twitches her way through a ridiculous part that quickly becomes annoying to watch . paul sorvino is  well  the paul sorvino type cast from other mobster films . the supporting cast is likewise allowed to play to the balcony in the broadest slapstick  pratfall fashion imaginable . what is supposed to be a comedy ends up being just silly and overdone . director greg yaitanes needs to go back to tv sitcoms had this flimsy story been compressed into a half  hour gig it might have had a chance . grady harp  ,0
i cant help it but i seem to like films that are meant to be scary and are just plain bad . i have personally listed it in my own top   worst movies right under creatures of the abyss  . watch this film and have a laugh just don  t expect to see any academy awards for acting . more chance of understanding the film its self . in all honesty though i have seen much worse than this . plus some maniac cruising round the desert wiping the same people out that just died is that unbelievable that its got to be original . i think its one of those love or hate movies . you can make up your own mind yes its awful but it pulls it off somehow thats why i love it  ,0
i went and saw rivers and tides again today . it  s the second time in two days and yes  i do see movies i like as many times as is necessary . yesterday i was struck by the brilliance of the images and goldsworthy  s works . this morning when i threw the coins i received    the abysmal  water  . goldsworthy has an affinity with water  hence the title . i received the  th line changing which moved to   the army . to blake art was a war . anyway  i knew i had to see the film again .  br    br   i read one of the few reviews extant online from the sf examiner . the critic loved the film but said goldsworthy  s comments got in the way of his enjoyment of the film . he  d rather have only the images and the wonderful soundtrack . so i was aware of that as i watched this second time .  br    br   yesterday i thought that i  d vote for andy goldsworthy as king of the world . well today i could get a little bit beyond the images and listen to what he had to say . could i enjoy the film without his comments  what he is doing  what he is saying goes way beyond  art  . his understanding of water  time  stone  change  and on and on made me think the man is the reincarnation of lao tsu or some avatar . some of his work  words are zen like . his knowledge . . .  br    br   anyway  the film is only  apparently  being shown here in the bay area . be a trend setter . go to your local cinema and tell them  no insist that they have to book a film you  ve heard about from the hinter lands . it  s called rivers and tides .  br    br    ,1
i have seen the movie holes and say that it has to be the best movie all year long . it brings out the child in everyone . i mean who would come up with the idea of having troublesome boys dig holes as their punishment  louis sachar thats who . although the movie was different from the book it was still very good . for example caveman  stanley was supposed to be the biggest one there . weight wise and height wise but zigzag  ricky was taller and armpit  theodore was bigger . also x  ray  rex was supposed to be one of the smallest boys but wasn  t . the only thing that i didn  t like about the movie was that the flashbacks were rather persuasive and long . i would have rather seen more of the present than past but thats just my opinion . i especially like the work of the boys though . like squid  alan who was played by jake m . smith was supposed to be a moody and tough kid . jake m . smith performed just that and did a great job at it as did almost all of the actors in holes . so i would say if you havent seen holes yet then you should definatly see it when it comes out again or you  ll be missing out on a whole lotta fun .  ,1
an excellent movie and great example of how scary a movie can be without really showing the viewer anything . it  s a set of four stories all revolving around the tenants of a charmingly old  fashioned house and their various gruesome and horrific fates  all tied together by a wrap  around story about a scotland yard inspector searching for a missing horror film star . it starts out with a story about a mystery writer whose main character becomes a little too realistic  followed by a story about two old romantic rivals who become obsessed over a wax figure in a museum  then a story about a sweetly angelic little child who is anything but  and closing with the story of what happened to the missing film starand what he does to the inspector . it  s a gorgeous print that lets you really appreciate the work of director duffell and what he was able to accomplish with a very small budget . add to that the acting talents of peter cushing  christopher lee  denholm elliott  joss ackland  ingrid pitt and jon pertwee and you  ve got a movie that can be enjoyed again and again . just don  t answer the phone if anyone from stoker real estate calls to offer you a bargain on a beautiful house in the english countryside  ,1
  metamoprhis  is the story of a dashing young scientist  revered at the local college  is brought under investigation by financial providers for the college . this forces him to take shortcuts in typical bad  hollywood melodramatic fashion .  br    br   my first thought after this movies conclusion was this .  not good  but not bad  for early  to  mid eighties .  of course  i then realized that it was made in      which almost propelled it down to a     but decided to keep it at the mediocre    that it is .  br    br    metamorphis  does on a few occasions  seem like a good movie desperately trying to get out . the acting  while not stellar  is mostly competent . you can even see the occasional glisten of a modest quality . pacing is a large problem with the movie . after thinking i had been watching for ninety minutes  i realized i  d only been watching an hour . special effects aren  t stellar  but the director seems to be mostly competent enough to work around that weakness .  br    br   the lead  a mildly charismatic male that seems to be attempting a blended channeling of tom cruise and christopher reeves  reminded me mostly of matt dillon  s character in  wild things  . the female heroine does an ok job  but does not distinguish herself in anyway . there  s a  naughty girl  role in here  and the actress does what she can with it  but it doesn  t seem like much . there is a child actor that the director can  t decide if he  s morose  cheerful or just weird .  br    br   pacing  as i said  is the worst problem with this movie  until a final battle with the bad guy that would make a power ranger blush . it is bizarre and inexplicable  until the final scene which is supposed to be dramatic but simply hilarious  saturated with every bad camera trick and overacting that can be compressed in about thirty seconds .  br    br   a decent one  time watch on the  mill creek   chilling movie pack  . nothing that is going to bring you back  and nothing to buy on its own .  ,0
the plot of the story and the performance of the lead actors are very much down  to  earth  the romance between two teen  age boys on the screen was done in good taste . you can easily relate to their emotions if you are one but if you are not one  you can appreciate the kind of love the film is trying to impart .  ,1
i hated the first episode of this show   protesting hippies   so much in     that i shunned the rest . however  when it came on  the paramount comedy channel  i watched it in full and  to my surprise  found it absolutely hilarious  motto never judge a comedy series in its first week    br    br   set in       hippies  stars simon pegg as  ray purbbs   editor of an  oz   like underground magazine called  mouth  . his friends are the feminist jill  laid  back alex  and the half  wit hugo . back in the late     s  there was a feeling of incredible optimism amongst the young  that they could change the world through the printing of magazines nobody read . rather than sneering at the hippies  naivety   hippies  is affectionate towards it . arthur mathews  scripts cheekily parody a number of that era  s icons   hair    woodstock    the graduate   even the infamous  oz  obscenity trial of the early     s . excellent performances from the cast julian rhind  tutt  s  alex  strangely put me in mind of the richard o  sullivan character from  man about the house  . its a shame that there was never a second series  possibly because of people like me . if you missed  hippies   give it a try . once you get past the dire opener  you  re in for a treat   ,1
one of the worst films ever . not funny  poor tv style cinematography  bad acting . sad to see so many famous old actors barely able to walk  let alone act . lead female nancy young can  t act . terrible direction . sub  par with bad tv movies . occasional weak jokes fall flat . even the basic premise of the movie makes no sense . somehow they are supposed to stop a wedding from happening but there  s no logic behind their actions . slow pacing made my wife stop watching but i suffered through it . the old men are supposed to be acting like they are young and horny  but it comes off as pathetic instead of funny . how did they even get the money to make this   ,0
well  i do like the gore in this movie  it is genuingly unsetteling . anyone that  s been to the dentist will know why . the story really isn  t that bad  corbin bersen  s character  s motivations do make a lot more sense than in most horror movies .  br    br   i  ve seen worse acting  directing  script  etc . but at the end of the day this is still a bad horror movie . so it comes down to if you enjoy that type of thing or not . i tried to watch the sequel  but it was exactly  exactly the same thing as this movie . just keep in mind if you enjoy people getting tortured at the dentist  then this is the movie for you   ,0
there are often badly  matched couples  in the general sense of the term   in huston  s movies   african queen   heaven knows mister allison   roots of heaven   misfits  . . .  the barbarian and the geisha   check the title  is another good example  so to speak . it seems that japanese stuff was trendy at the time as such works as  sayonara   the world of suzie wong  and  the teahouse of the august moon  bear witness . huston  s effort might be the worst of this rather bad lot  with the exception of  susie  maybe  . john wayne perfectly fits in ford  s world  in huston  s he  s like a bull in a china shop . his japanese partner is totally bland . even the dramatic scenes  cholera epidemic  do not save the movie from absolute boredom .  br    br   only those utterly enamoured of huston  s every work need to choose this  among all his other great movies around .  ,0
this was another great tom berenger movie . . but some people are right it was like another sgt barnes character but it was still awsome . . tom berenger played a great sniper in the jungles of panama  billy zane was a wuss at first just like cpl upham from saving private ryan but then he got a little more aggresive in the end  sniper was awsome and action buffs should watch it . . i remind you it wouldnt have as much action as a reg action flick . . i got this one on dvd too and it is excellent   ,1
saw it at the philadelphia gay and lesbian film fest .  br    br   what can i say  against my better judgment  i liked it  but it seemed to me that that acting was a little . . . weak  mostly i noticed this from the family of the teen boy  . i mean  the script wasn  t stellar to begin with  but the actors didn  t make me believe the relationships .  br    br   the plot is also predictable .  br    br   nonethelss  i liked it . the characters are likable  and the plot is not challenging or upsetting . it  s sweet  the characters care about each other  and i don  t count it as fifty minutes ill  spent .  br    br   but i don  t recommend it .  ,0
snow white is in my opinion a bad movie on an artistic point of view . the plot is pretty much foreseeable  the characters are stereotypes  the editing too exaggerated . anyway  the movie seems not to have a lot of artistic ambitions .  br    br   instead  i think this is a straight commercial thing . including a character from the french part of switzerland  the actor is the leader of the band he is touring with in the movie  the band  s called sens unik  seems to aim to a larger audience . a straight german  swiss movie would not have sold in the french part  and vice versa . what really got on my nerves were the product placements all over the movie . sometines scenes remembered of advertisement clips   br    br   i also think the topic of  young people taking drugs without any other targets in their lives  is a wide spread reality in zurich . therefore  it should be elaborated with more care . i hope samir got enough money with snow white  in order that his next movie is gonna show his true artistic skills .  ,0
hollywood  the home of hype  glamor and the search for profits  is scarcely ruled by spiritual values  and so it comes as no surprise that its attempts at investigations of the spiritual life are thin and often silly  better to go farther afield   to the films of bresson  dreyer  rossellini and bergman  for probing depictions of the spirituality  .  strange cargo  is no exception . this odd hybrid of adventure film  love story and religious parable trivializes the very insights it tries to communicate . that a figure of providence and salvation would work to match verne  clark gable at his most cockily mannered and self  regarding  and julie  joan crawford  snarling and spitting out every other word in an attempt to be the queen of tough dames  seems ludicrous at best . is this the patron saint of the star system at work  matching warring egos before sending them off to further penal servitude on the m  g  m lot  but . . . there are good supporting performances here  and visually arresting moments the shadowy prison barracks the escaping boat by moonlight  or against a painterly cloudscape julie walking along the seafront as the wind whips up julie and monsieur pig  peter lorre  bargaining for verne  s freedom as the storm builds an unusually ennobling gay prison romance between two convicts . . . above all  there is paul lukas  s dignified and detached performance as hessler  a murderer who can appreciate cambreau  s virtues  yet turns his back on him . in the film  s most arresting moment  hessler  having left cambreau  stands outside the cabin . we hear the wind through the jungle  see the shadows on his face  which conveys a moment of fear and self  doubt . then he exits into the night . in this moment  hessler achieves an ambiguity  depth and existential strength that none of the other characters manage to achieve . is the film  s secret that its deepest sympathies are allied with hessler   ,0
well not actually . this movie is very entertaining though . went and saw it with the girlfriend last night and had to use the  i think there might be something in my eye  routine . the movie is a great combination of comedy and typical romance . jim carey is superb as a down on his luck reporter who is given the power to change himself and the city in which he resides . in fact all the characters are great . the movie is not overly funny or sappy  good flick to go see with the wife .  br    br   all in all     . . . . note  i am not an easy grader . thats all from bigv over and out   ,1
i  ve read many negative reviews of this movie and finally got a chance to see it on dvd . to be honest i really don  t know what the problem with it is .  br    br   it  s a decent murder mystery thriller  shown from various points of view  from an eccentric cast of often drugged out potential killers  suspects  including the late porn king  john holmes . please read the plot synopsis for the exact details of the movie  s plot  i wish to contribute more to a review than a synopsis .  br    br   many reviewers went so far to give this movie their lowest rating due to violence but i really don  t see it . many modern movies were worse  saving private ryan was ultimately more violent than this movie  which often relies on implied blood stains than actual brutal slayings  the murders depicted in this film were done with lead pipes  afterall  .  br    br   i was enthralled with both halves of the movie  the first showing john holmes as a hopeless cash hungry drug addict  and the second half showing his side as a minor conspirator in a senseless bloodbath . the movie has excellent acting  even though dylan mcdemorant looks more than a bit out of place in his biker  esque personia and goatee  ed bad boy personality .  br    br   the soundtrack was also awesome  a fantastic mix of    s b  side rock and obscure pop  spread out over a couple of hours in all the right places ala boogie nights .  ,1
this is full of major spoilers  so beware .  br    br    prix de beaute  always suffers in comparison to the two films louise brooks made with g . w . pabst   pandora  s box  and  diary of a lost girl   but in some ways   prix  is the quintessential brooks film . here she has a chance to be charming without the dark side of her pabst collaboration . what  prix  has that the pabst films don  t is music . in this early french film  the whole louise brooks mystique is fleshed out powerfully with a conjunction of image  song and music . the charleston is what seems most associated with brooks  she was the first to dance it in europe   but the essence of the actress comes across more strongly in the tango . the tango also plays a plot point in  prix   being the music she danced with on her short rise to stardom after becoming miss europe . later  when she has forsaken her fame in favor of a mundane existence as the wife of jealous husband andre  the longing for her forsaken fame becomes apparent when the same tango record is seen on her apartment record player . so appropriate is the tango to brooks it is used to accompany the documentary about her life   looking for lulu   a film narrated by shirley maclaine . the brazen and forceful quality of the tango epitomizes louise brooks  strong  headed but elegant and erotic individuality .  br    br   the song   je n  ai qu  un amour  c  est toi   adds an immense amount of pathos to what is not a great film  but a very good one  . by the way  brooks  voice was not dubbed for the film by edith piaf as some have claimed . piaf was born in      and wasn  t discovered until     . the song  however  is what brooks  character  lucienne  sings to andre at the beginning of the film to cheer him up and express her deep affection for him . and at the climax it is the song she sings for her screen test  which she views with the producers and managers who intend to shape her career . it continues on screen after husband andre  who has followed her to the screening room  shoots and kills her . in a single shot  with lucinenne  s dead body in repose at the bottom of the screen while her screen test continues above with the song she once sang to andre  the essence of what movies do that other art forms do not is perfectly characterized . as andre watches his now dead wife sing to him on screen  the murder weapon still smoking  he subtly smiles . she is now his forever  and by association  ours .  br    br   coincidentally  louise brooks real life career crashed and burned after  prix de beaute   so it was also the death of her final starring roll as well . this film really seals the brooks mystique more so than the pabst films  which are superior films  no doubt  . it also points out what it is about the movies that create the whole idea of the  cult  of the movies  where people like brooks  james dean and marilyn monroe live on more intensely after their death than when they were alive .  ,1
i stumbled upon this movie on cable and was totally hooked . the story of a group of surfers who ride the big waves  waves that are monstrously huge  waves that would make any rational person run away in terror is a one that manages to be spectacular and make you understand why people spend their lives chasing waves . there is nothing special about the film  other than it brings together some very interesting people who are are in love with what they do and lets them talk . sure there are scenes of them surfing  but what makes this movie so special is the people . here are a bunch of guys who are so enthusiastic about what they do that it crosses over to the people watching . half way into this movie you  ll want to go off and learn to surf as well . few documentaries have ever managed to covey the passion that these people have and its the films ability to make us feel it that makes this a great film . see it .  ,1
having watched this film strictly on the strength of reviewers  ratings i was most pleasantly surprised . although clearly low  budget  it bears the signs of clever ingenuity . for example  when julia wakes in the strange house and looks out the window i found myself thinking that her sense of isolation would be enhanced with an exterior shot focused on her face and then moving backwards to include the house and its isolated location . and lo and behold  the next scene was exactly that last shot of the house standing lonely on the cliff at the water  s edge . there are other examples of how a clever director can elevate his film to the level of a very enjoyable thriller . savvy viewers will surely spot them but should rest assured they will not be disappointed .  br    br   as to the performances  george macready is his usual creepy self  barely maintaining his composure while suggesting a capacity for unadulterated violence . nina foch was surprisingly good as the no  nonsense working girl who  s not about to submit without a fight . but dame may witty  oh boy  she even had me doubting my own eyes and believing she could get away with her evil schemes .  br    br   this a real diamond in the rough and not to be missed .  ,1
terry gilliam traveled again to the future  he had already done it in  brazil   to tell this story about a virus that  s destroying the human race .  br    br   the script is totally crazy with some easy tricks on it but it  s quite entertaining and gilliam proves that he  s got imagination  the futuristic scenes are just great  . as for the cast  bruce willis and the beautiful madeleine stowe  whatever happened to her    are just ok  but brad pitt is so annoying  whenever he plays roles that are out of his hand he results so forced and he  s not credible at all . he should just play good  looking successful young men .  br    br   my rate      ,1
if i could go back  even as an adult and relive the days of my summer  s spent at camp . . . i would be there so fast . the camps i went to weren  t even this great . they were in texas where the mosquitoes actually carry people off but we had horses and fishing . the movie cinematography was astounding  the characters funny and believable especially perkins  pollack and arkin . sam raimi  s character and sub  antics were priceless . so who ever thought this movie was lame . . . i have deep pity for because they can  t suspend their disbelief long enough to imagine camp life again as an adult or they never went as kids . the whole point was that these people had an opportunity to regress and become juvenile again and so they did at every opportunity . i wish i could . it was funny  intelligent  beautifully scripted  brilliantly cast and the artistry takes me back so i want to watch it over and over just for the scenery even . sorta like dances with wolves and ladyhawk . . . good movies but the wilderness becomes a character as much as the actors . rent it  see it  buy it and watch it over and over and over . . . never gets old .     ,1
murder in mesopotamia  i have always considered one of the better poirot books  as it is very creepy and has an ingenious ending . there is no doubt that the tv adaptation is visually striking  with some lovely photography and a very haunting music score . as always david suchet is impeccable as hercule poirot  the comedic highlight of the episode being poirot  s battle with a mosquito in the middle of the night  and hugh fraser is good as the rather naive captain hastings . the remainder of the cast turn in decent performances  but are careful not to overshadow the two leads  a danger in some christie adaptations . some of the episode was quite creepy  a juxtaposition of an episode as tragic as five little pigs  an episode that i enjoyed a lot more than this one . what made it creepy in particular  putting aside the music was when louise leidner sees the ghostly face through the window . about the adaptation  it was fairly faithful to the book  but i will say that there were three things i didn  t like . the main problem was the pacing  it is rather slow  and there are some scenes where very little happens . i didn  t like the fact also that they made joseph mercado a murderer . in the book  i see him as a rather nervous character  but the intervention of the idea of making him a murderer  and under  developing that  made him a less appealing character  though i am glad they didn  t miss his drug addiction .  i also noticed that the writers left out the fact that mrs mercado in the book falls into hysteria when she believes she is the murderer  s next victim .  the other thing that wasn  t so impressive was that i felt that it may have been more effective if the adaptation had been in the viewpoint of amy leatheran  like it was in the book  amy somehow seemed less sensitive in the adaptation . on the whole  despite some misjudgements on the writers  behalf  i liked murder in mesopotamia .     bethany cox .  ,1
what happened  what we have here is basically a solid and plausible premise and with a decent and talented cast  but somewhere the movie loses it . actually  it never really got going . there was a little excitement when we find out that angie is not really pregnant  then find out that she is after all  but that was it . steve martin  who is a very talented person and usually brings a lot to a movie  was dreadful and his entire character was not even close to being important to this movie  other than to make it longer . i really would have liked to see more interactions between the main characters  kate and angie  and maybe try not for a pure comedy  which unfortunately it was not  but maybe a drama with comedic elements . i think if the movie did this it could have been very funny since both actresses are quite funny in their own ways and sitting here i can think of numerous scenarios that would have been a riot .  ,0
spacecamp is my favorite movie . it is a great story and also inspires others .  br    br   the acting was excellent and my wife and i went to see lea thompson in cabaret years later due to her performance in the movie . it is unfortunate that the challenger accident delayed and hurt the movie .  br    br   the   th anniversary of the challenger accident is coming up . i knew one of the challenger astronauts off and on since childhood on the carnegie mellon campus where my father went to school i also know a close friend of the late pilot .  br    br   i was the technical review last year for national bsa for the boy scout astronomy merit badge and i still find spacecamp a great movie to recommend to scouts doing the space related merit badges i teach .  br    br   i ran into the late astronaut again as an adult and was following a schedule of engineering education we had put together when challenger blew up . i wound up sitting in with willard rockwell and his engineers   invisible   going over things after the accident at the astrotech stockholders meeting by chance as a result  so i  m much closer to the accident and any movie similarities . i made sure that i was a good student and finished the degree four years later  strangely enough  on the recommendation of the rockwell engineer who told them not to fly challenger in     and who later built endeavour .  ,1
well its about time . i had really given up any and all hope that there was going to be a standout episode among this season  s entries . while there have still been far too many drab to hohum entries  at least this episode turned out well . its rather funny that director rob schmidt who only has the not bad wrong turn to his credit and writer john esposito whose only scripting chores to date have included tale of the mummy and graveyard shift should be the ones to give us the best written and most thought provoking episode of the season . in  right to die  we are treated to the story of cliff and abbey . at the start of the episode the couple are having a conversation . abbey has caught cliff cheating and he is desperately trying to win her back . while they speak  they find themselves in a car accident where cliff is left with only scratches and bruises  but abbey is thrown from the car and catches on fire when a spark ignites and gasoline that had dripped onto her catches her on fire . and this is just the setup people . once in the hospital cliff must decide whether or not abbey should live in this state with no skin and only nerve reflexes . there  s also a side effect too . every time she flatlines  abbey goes a walking as a ghost and causes trouble for all sorts of people . hands down this is the best episode of the season and certainly ranks as one of the top episodes ever . from the gruesome effects to the taut script which threw in a few twists i never saw coming and suspense so palpable you can almost touch it  right to die should have the right to go on living forever .  ,1
i wanted to see this movie ever since it was first advertised on tv . i went to tinsel town to see it last night at     . i regret the day that wasted my ticket on this trash when i could of saw something better . the beginning was all a bunch sex trash and cliches . they exaggerated the way love works in reality . all of the girls were stereo types . the boyfriend was too stupid for his own age . the passing gases that the pregnant girl kept having barely got any laughs . the bank robbery was completely boring with gags that have been used in other movies . their getaway car was an old beat up chevy van that they claimed that had no breaks . hey why didn  t they get nice girlish vehicle for the robbery instead  it might have boosted the audience opinion about the movie . this movie was very low low low low low budgeted since nothing in there was damaged or destroyed . this movie had a lot of stuff in it that would drive christian people nuts . hey i even expected a car chase scene because all bank robbing movies have car chases but i but there was never any . so i rate this movie b which stands for low budgeted and  out of ten stars .  ,0
i have seen a couple movies on eating disorders but this one was definitely my favorite one . the problem with the other ones was that the people with the eating disorders towards the end just automatically get better or accept the fact that they need help and thats it . this movie i thought was more realistic cause in this one the main character lexi doesn  t automatically just get better . she gets better and then has a drawback . i think this movie shows more than the others that i  ve seen that getting better doesn  t just happen  it  s hard work and takes time  it  s a long path to recovery . i think this movie shows all of that very well . there should be more movies like this .  ,1
this is one of the worst movies i have seen to date  the best part was christian j . meoli  leonard  attempting to act jumping up and down outside the bar  kind  of like i wanted to do on the dvd  to spare the rest of humanity the agony of watching this shitty film . it has a great cast so you keep watching waiting for it to get good  i mean with sean astin  andrew   played his part perfectly  did a great job  too bad it was in this film   kyra sedgwick  bevan   ron livingston  chad   rene zellweger  poet   they put her name on the cover she has a total of  line and less then  seconds in the whole movie . . .  br    br   if the cast had any dignity  they would go out and buy all the copies of this film and burn them along with writer  director george hickenlooper and writer john enbom  ,0
okay  this movie fck in  rules . it is without question one of the most technically inept pieces of cinema ever made . absolutely terrible  but you gotta see it . rent this with your buddies and come up with a drinking game or just have fun  it  s hilarious . and the behind  the  scenes featurette proves it  you can do anything with paper plates and finger paint . awesome . okay  rent it just for this one scene two characters are actually walking in place for about  minutes in a shot . the director  on the commentary  says  yeah  the tracking was so smooth it looks like they  re . . .  . yeah  right man  they are totally walking in place . it  s so funny .  ,0
  cinderella  is a film about a young girl whose mother passed away and her father remarried . once her father died  cinderella  s stepmother became very mean to her and made her do all of the chores around the house  like cleaning up after her two evil stepsisters . one day the king sent out a message to all of the single women to attend the royal ball in honor of his son  to find a wife . of course  cinderella didn  t get to go  but her stepsisters did . cinderella was very upset and thought that there was no way she could attend the royal ball  until her fairy godmother appeared . so she did some magic and made cinderella into a beautiful woman  but she had to be back by midnight because that is when the magic changes back . while at the royal ball  cinderella loses track of time and the clock strikes midnight  so she runs out of the palace and loses her glass slipper . then the king orders the duke to find the women who wore that slipper . the duke searched every house  but finally found the women who it belonged to  cinderella .  br    br   clyde geronimi  wilfred jackson  and hamilton luske directed one of the best animated disney films in     . this film is about a magical fairytale . in the beginning of the film cinderella was a servant to her own family and had nobody to love her  but with a little bit of magic her whole life changed around and finally found love .  br    br   my favorite thing about  cinderella  is the music . when cinderella  s fairy godmother appeared doing her magic  she sang the song bibbidi bobbidi boo . when i was a child  it was one of my favorite songs to sing around my house  so i will never forget it . i also loved the part when cinderella and the prince were singing the song so this is love while they were dancing because they realized that they are in love . overall this film was my favorite film when i was a little child because every little girl wants to live a fairy tale life .  ,1
i sat through both parts of che last night  back to back with a brief bathroom break  and i can  t recall when  hours last passed so quickly . i  d had to psyche myself up for a week in advance because i have a real  thing  about directors  producers and editors who keep putting over blown  over long quasi epics in front of us and i feel that on the whole   to  .  hours is about right for a movie . so  hours seemed to be stretching the limits of my tolerance and i was very dubious about the whole enterprise . but i will say upfront that this is a beautifully  i might say lovingly  made movie and i  m really glad i saw it . director steven soderbergh is to be congratulated on the clarity of his vision . the battle scenes zing as if you were dodging the bullets yourself .  br    br   if there is a person on the planet who doesn  t know  ernesto  che  guevara was the argentinian doctor who helped fidel castro overthrow fulgencio batista via the     cuban revolution . when i was a kid in the     s  che  s image was everywhere on bedroom wall posters  on t shirts  on magazine covers . che  s image has to be one of the most over exploited ever . if the famous images are to be relied on  then che was a very good looking guy  the epitome of revolutionary romanticism . had he been butt ugly  i have to wonder if he would have ever been quite so popular in the public imagination  of course dying young helps .  br    br   movies have been made about che before  notably the excellent motorcycle diaries of     which starred the unbearably cute gael garcia bernal as young che  touring south america and seeing the endemic poverty which formed his marxist politics  but i don  t think anyone has ever tackled the entire story from beginning to end  and this two  parter is an ambitious project . i hope it pays off for soderbergh but i can only imagine that instant commercial success may not have been uppermost in his mind .  br    br   the first movie  the agentine  shows che meeting castro in mexico and follows their journey to cuba to start the revolution and then the journey to new york in     to address the un . cleverly shot black and white images look like contemporary film but aren  t . the second film  guerilla  picks up again in     when che arrives in bolivia to start a new revolutionary movement . the second movie takes place almost entirely in the forest . as far as i can see it was shot mostly in spain but i can still believe it must have been quite grueling to film . benicio del toro is excellent as che  a part he seems born to play .  br    br   personally  i felt that the argentine  ie part one  was much easier to watch and more  entertaining  in the strictly movie sense  because it is upbeat . they are winning the revolution will succeed . che is in his element leading a disparate band of peasants  workers and intellectuals in the revolutionary cause . the second part is much harder to watch because of the inevitability of his defeat . in much the same way that the recent valkyrie  while being a good movie  was an exercise in witnessing heroic failure  so i felt the same about part two of che  guerilla  . we know at the outset that he dies  we know he fails . it is frustrating because the way the story is told  it is obvious fairly early on that the fomentation of revolution in bolivia is doomed che is regarded as a foreign intruder and fails to connect with the indigenous peoples in the way that he did with the cubans . he doggedly persists which is frustrating to watch because i felt that he should have known when to give up and move on to other  perhaps more successful  enterprises . the movie does not romanticise him too much . he kills people  he executes  he struggles with his asthma and follows a lost cause long after he should have given up and moved on  he leaves a wife alone to bring up five fatherless children .  br    br   but overall  an excellent exercise in classic movie making . one note as i watched the us trained bolivian soldiers move in en masse to pick off che and his small band of warriors one by one  it reminded me of the finale to butch cassidy . i almost turned to my husband and said so  but hesitated  thinking he would find such thoughts trite and out of place . as we left the theatre he turned to me and said  didn  t you think the end was like butch cassidy    ,1

i just viewed the film two days ago  and i was filled with anticipation  being that paris is my second favorite city in europe and i spent a very romantic   months there in the     s . i was somewhat disappointed that most of this group of vignettes  while original and artistically done  did not capture the  light  and beauty of the city very well . nor enough of the romance  we saw none of the tree  lined boulevards . . . there was too much darkness  not only literally but figuratively . some of the plots manipulated the viewer it seemed  and let him  her down  flat   the marais sequence  the coiffure salesman sequence  to give two examples  . the uplifting  good ones the mime sequence  the cemetery  the montmartre  though it left too much to the viewer to comprehend   the  cowboy  vignette  and the sacre coeur   seemed few and far between  and i would have liked to have seen such a wonderful actor as orlando bloom be in something that would have showcased his originality more .  ,1
an incoherent mess with a gratingly deafening sound track   soul survivors  is the latest entry in the  who  s dead and who  s alive  genre of horror films . two teenaged couples  sean and cassie and matt and annabel  prepare to go off to different colleges  but before they part until thanksgiving break  they attend one last fling at a rave  type party in some burnt  out church at the suggestion of lusciously slutty annabel  eliza dushku  a . k . a . faith  the other vampire slayer  . motiveless creepy guys start paying far too much attention to cassie  the generic melissa sagemiller  for reasons that are never explained  and before long  the quartet leave the party . driving away in their suv  they are pursued and then passed by the motiveless creepy guys  who promptly and inexplicably do an intentional    in the middle of the highway  causing a nasty and fatal accident as the suv flips over an embankment and plunges into a river . sean is killed  or is he    and cassie spends the rest of the movie coping with loneliness and guilt  she was driving  when she  s not being haunted by sean  s ghost or chased by those motiveless creepy guys . much unexplained incoherence follows as cassie  s mental state degenerates further  until we reach the predictable conclusion . so  who is dead and who is alive  after ninety minutes of this purgatory  who actually cares   ,0
jamie foxx is my favorite comedian . however  i feel that he sold out in order to gain his first big budget lead role . foxx follows in the footsteps of the likes of chris tucker  martin lawrence and dave chapple  who have all seen their talents wasted by stereotyping producers who think black males who commit pretty crimes is a funny concept  see money talks  blue streak  .  br    br   okay i laughed a few times and granted all of these comedians continue to pick up hilarious roles  but i would love to see these guys branch out ala marlon wayans portrayal in requiem to a dream . or in living color  s tommy davidson and damon wayans moving performances in spike lee  s satire bamboozled .  ,0
  st watched            out of    dir  sydney pollack    dvd version i watched titled   days of the condor   so so cia drama full of laid  back performances making for a very laid  back movie . the premise of the story revolves around  out of  members of a cia research group being killed with robert redford  s character  codename  condor  being the one that was left . who killed them and why  that  s what redford tries to find out while trying to not be the  th victim at the same time . along the way  he gets faye dunaway  s character involved involved  originally because he needs a place to hide  and then she eventually helps him out after a little lovey  dovey time . this is one of a handful of innocent guy on the run stories but this one doesn  t have a lot of suspense . the flat performances don  t help and the finish doesn  t seal the deal for the audience enough either . despite having a good director in sydney pollack and a group of classic performers  the story and the performances are not what they should be and therefore the movie is not what it should be .  ,0
i will say that at least the movie makes sense  but it  s bad . the acting for the most part is not good  i think only sky showed any promise  and you feel awkward watching it . all of the scenes that should be meaningful are really shallow  like when ng comes out to her parents . there are a lot of corny details  like the kanji tattoo on the sky  s shoulder  the magnets on the girls  refrigerator and the god awful decor at the sets . . . and the music . . . and clothes . . and everything . real life has never been like this movie . the boy says at one point  i  m gay  not corny .  and not aware . even the commentary is awful  i turned it off after ng talks about how she was weirded out playing a lesbian .  ,0
doris day never lets a bad script get her down . even in the most trying of circumstances  day gives     and usually comes out unscathed . this comedy  perhaps inspired by a real  life new york city black  out in     but actually adapted from a late     s french play by claude magnier  gives doris little to do but spoof her own goody  goody image and  in the second  half  be comically sedated  which is amusing because of the spin day gives to the situation  . there are some funny lines here  yet the staginess of the material has obviously been carried over from the play . . . and instead of conjuring up some amusing incidents within the big apple  we get stuck in the suburbs . doris  co  stars  patrick o  neal  robert morse  and terry  thomas  are not well  suited to her  and neither is the shapeless hairdo they  ve got her wearing . still  it  s not terrible  it features a few big laughs  and for day  buffs it  s a must  see .  from   ,0
all of david prior  s movies are terrible on all counts bad writing  bad acting  bad cinematography  no budget  the director  s brother is usually cast as the male lead  . but they all have incredible entertainment value because of their unintentional hilarity . the plot of almost every david prior  film   as i like to refer to them  is basically the same . manly all  american commandos team up to blow up communist baddies . but unlike other cold war  era garbage such as red dawn  prior  s movies are actually funny because of their over  the  top premises and acting . the best part of jungle assault is the scene in which becker  or was is the other dude   is being summoned by general mitchell for a top  secret mission in south america . the funniest line in the movie is then delivered  something to the effect of  this is my roommate  i trained him well  . what . you trained your roommate  and apparently this is going to be their solution to avoiding eviction .  br    br   if you can find these gems on video used anywhere  buy them . they are all funny and even funnier after a few beers . watch them with a group of your friends for a true mst  k  style experience . so far my friends and i have managed to get a hold of night wars and aerobicide aka  killer workout  . but the one i recommend the most over them all is final sanction  with the freakish  looking robert z  dar .  ,0
riff randell is a wildly  obsessed fan of the rock group the ramones and so are most of the students in the school . but a new tyrant of a principal  ms . togar thinks rock  n  roll is a bad influence on the students  especially the music from the ramones . so  when riff finds out they  re performing in town  she skips class for a couple of days to get tickets for herself and her friends . but when ms . togar discovers why she really took those days off she confiscates the tickets . while  this is happening tom roberts is totally love struck over riff  but riff  s friend kate rambeau feels the same way about tom . but riff has her eyes set only on the lead singer joe ramone and hopefully in getting to that concert to get them to play her song .  br    br   fun  fun  fun  yep  that  s right  rock n roll high school  doesn  t drift away from it main focus a boisterously  daggy romp  it wasn  t what i was expecting  that  s for sure . everyone participating in this dandy project looks like they  re having a great time and the relaxing nature of it shows on screen with the energy providing such a glowing spirit  which makes it a priceless experience . that  s not to say i think its art and the plot is as pointless as can be . but watching this passionately  crazy ride that escalates into some good harmless high jinks  i just couldn  t wipe the grin off my face . it  s tacky  very cheesy  densely chaotic  but damn it  s funky  dory   br    br   this low  budget  b  grade feature from producer roger corman and john dante who was co  writer  and plus he co  directed some scenes when director allan arkush was hospitalised on the last day shoot  . is basically a glorious homage on the rocking     s flicks by sticking with the fruitful clichs and throwing into the stew the teenage rebellion tag because of the generation gap between them and the adults  who always know best  . these features might not be particularly fresh  but they do rack up some appeal because of the dynamically  gusto treatment . the film has just one thing on mind  to go out on a bang  and they manage to do that . courtesy of  the ramones   who play themselves . really  you could say its one big trendy video clip  since it  s all about the ramones well  most of it anyway . i see a lot flack towards the ramones  acting ability . these are musicians not actors  which means it  s not about their acting here  it  s the music we  re suppose to dig . they  re here to perform  which  they deliver in that front with some kick ass tracks that peppered the film to create a totally upbeat vibe . especially  their flamboyant concert performances . the buzzing soundtrack also had some killer tunes from some other artists such as devo  the velvet underground  mc   fleetwood mack  eddie and the hot rods and alice cooper . but these jumping tracks fitted in well with the carefree feel and even the score was worked in rather well . especially in the scenes involving ms . togar with the score grasping the right mood that surrounds her mind set . the playful mood of the film is pretty much like a roller coaster ride with such a racy pace between the electrifying tunes and comical segments ranging from scattered slapstick routines to it  s sometimes clever  tongue  in  cheek dialogue . thrown in for good measure is a variety of light and heavy gags  which i found very pleasurable and it gave it such a wider range to express itself .  br    br   what else gave the film an added boost had to be the divine pj soles  better known for her performance in halloween   who gave such a bang up performance as the peachy riff randell . other exemplary performances were dey young  as the extremely cute kate rambeau  vincent van patten as the gawky tom roberts and the go to man eaglebauer who  s stupendously played by clint howard . also some top drawer corman regulars pop up with great send up performances by mary woronov who  s excellent as the demanding ms . togar who  s pushing her unfair reign on the students  paul bartel as mr . mcgree and a small support role from dick millar towards the end . the enthusiastic acting is pretty campy  but that goes down well with the material and there  s a certain likability stemming from these characters  but we totally despise ms . togar and her hall monitor goons .  br    br   there  s no beating around the bush here when i say  rock  n  roll high school  is an intoxicating hoot  of a rad time   ,1
this movie stinks . i don  t think i have ever seen a movie so strung up on shock value . the plot was relatively interesting  but the dialog was super flat and the acting was bland . this could have been an a good movie . i think it just relied on it  s grotesque visuals . i can usually handle graphic scenes and human taboos  but it felt like miike shot it for the sake of shooting it . just one poorly executed film . there just isn  t anything to be entertained by watching this film unless you are fascinated by exhausting yourself with explicit scenes of incest  pedophilia  necrophilia  rape  self milking  parental and sibling abuse  and fecal dispersement . i think i just sold the film to many of you  but i meant it when i said this stinks . he has succeeded in other films  but i think you  d be better off watching someone pooping .  ,0
making the film as dark and visually fuzzy as possible in order to cover up the budget deficiencies is an often  used strategy in low  budget horror films  but this one takes it too far . it is so poorly lit and murky  and it takes place almost entirely at night  to boot  that you often end up virtually looking at a black screen  although perhaps the bad video transfer may also have had something to do with that  . alas   murky  is also the best word to describe the movie  s plot . the filmmakers throw in diverse  and unoriginal  horror ideas without any semblance of logic  and halfway through you get the feeling that they just about abandoned the effort to make a good horror film you know it when you see characters who are supposed to be in mortal danger  or  in some occasions  even dead  making small talk . . . .        ,0
recipe for one of the worst movies of all time a she  male villain who looks like it escaped from the wwf  has terrible aim with a gun that has inconsistent effects  the first guy she shoots catches on fire but when she shoots anyone else they just disappear  and takes time out to pet a deer . then you got the unlikable characters    year old college students  a lame attempt at a surprise ending and lots  lots more . avoid at all costs .  ,0
original claymation rudolph pretty good . original frosty cartoon needs a little work  but could be worse . but frosty and rudolph together on the fourth of july  c  mon  give me a break    this was one movie that shouldn  t have been made . it was bad . it didn  t really go for any holiday in particular  except july  . that made it especially bad since frosty and rudolph are usually associated with the christmas season . and any movie can be ruined by too much singing . the frequent songs made this movie seem a lot longer than it really was . the movie tried mixing two familiar chirstmastime characters with an american traditional holiday  which almost seems to  limit  it to america   too many pointless songs  and a lousy plotline . the result  a bad movie that can  t really be watched at any time of year . i would suggest you forgo this movie even if you like frosty and rudolph .  ,0
i saw brigadoon on tv last night    sept      . i am   years old and have been watching films as long as i can remember . i can truthfully say that brigadoon stands alone as by far and away the worst film i have ever seen . the accents were shameful . the local children  s club would have produced better sets . the characters were so wooden that they probably contracted dry rot from the tears of the patrons who had the misfortune to watch them . it is to be hoped that the stars of this film had hides thick enough to protect them from the embarrassment which they must have suffered on seeing this film . the owners of this tripe should perform a great service to mankind and destroy all copies of this film .  ,0
i  ve seen this movie when i was young  and i remembered it as one of the first films i have truly liked that was not an action movie or a comedy . so  in my later years i decided to watch it again and see if it was just nostalgia or was there really something in that movie . to my surprise  the movie held to my every expectations . it  s a great movie . emotional in the right amount  some jokes  nice songs  not great though  and that actually explains why i did not remember it was a musical  and all in all a great use to my time . i was surprised because the last movies from my childhood that i have revisited did not even pass my minimal demands of a decent movie and yet this movie  which i first saw in the second grade  made me cry today just like it made me cry then . maybe that  s because my dog died recently and maybe not  but the important thing is that it made me feel  and that  s why filmmakers make films  that and the money  of course  . yes  there are continuity glitches . yes  the script has holes  but it doesn  t matter . the movie itself is fun and smart . so don  t be fooled by cynical people who always look for the bad things in life  because nothing is perfect  and this movie gets a   not because it is perfect . it gets   simply because it made me feel .  ,1
i did not watch the entire movie . i could not watch the entire movie . i stopped the dvd after watching for half an hour and i suggest anyone thinking of watching themselves it stop themselves before taking the disc out of the case .  br    br   i like mafia movies both tragic and comic but corky romano can only be described as a tragic attempt at a mafia comedy .  br    br   the problem is corky romano simply tries too hard to get the audience to laugh  the plot seems to be an excuse for moving chris kattan  corky  from one scene to another . corky himself is completely overplayed and lacks subtlety or credulity  all his strange mannerisms come across as contrived  chris kattan is clearly  acting  rather than taking a role  it bounces you right out of the story . each scene is utterly predictable  the  comedic event  that will occur on the set is obvious as soon as each scene is introduced . in comedies such as mr . bean the disasters caused by the title character are funny because you can empathise with the characters motivations and initial event and the situation the character ends up in is not telegraphed . corky however gives the feeling that he is deliberately screwing up in a desperate attempt to draw a laugh from the audience .  br    br   if chris had not played such an alien character  who never really connects with the other characters in the movie  and whose behaviour is entirely inexplicable  except for trying to draw laughs  and the comedy scenes weren  t so predictable and stereotyped  all the jokes seemed far too familiar  this movie could have been watchable . but it isn  t . don  t watch it .  ,0
i quite enjoyed this movie for two reasons . the first is that it gives an insight into the world of loyalism in northern ireland  which is very rarely treated in movies  most of which tell us about the republican struggle . the second reason is the performances of the actors . i thought they gave very honest and convincing portrayals of a very seedy underworld that not many people hear about outside my native shores .  br    br   all in all  it is an entertaining ganster movie with stellar performances from a who  s who in northern irish actors cast . it wont move the earth  although it may slightly open some peoples eyes to the murky world of loyalist paramilitaries .  ,1
never cast models and playboy bunnies in your films  bob fosse  s  star    about dorothy stratten  of whom bogdanovich was obsessed enough to have married her sister after her murder at the hands of her low  life husband  is a zillion times more interesting than dorothy herself on the silver screen . patty hansen is no actress either . . i expected to see some sort of lost masterpiece a la orson welles but instead got audrey hepburn cavorting in jeans and a god  awful  poodlesque  hair  do . . . . very disappointing . . . .  paper moon  and  the last picture show  i could watch again and again . this clunker i could barely sit through once . this movie was reputedly not released because of the brouhaha surrounding ms . stratten  s tawdry death i think the real reason was because it was so bad   ,0
  ice age  is one of the cartoon movies ever produced by blue sky studios and released in     as the company  s first . we are introduced to the main characters a squirrel named scrat  voiced by chris wedge  and please note the sound of scrat  s screams is the sound of tom  s screams from the  tom and jerry  cartoons   a woolly mammoth named manny  voiced by ray romano of  everybody loves raymond    a sloth named sid  voiced by john leguizamo of  titan a . e .    and a saber toothed tiger named diego  voiced by denis leary of pixar  s  a bug  s life   .  br    br   the movie opens with scrat trying to bury an acorn and right after that  he caused an avalanche . we then see a herd going south for the coming ice age  except for manny  who is going the other way looking for other mammoths that looked like him  . sid comes out of his cave yawning  and saw that his family abandoned him . he then pays toll with some aardvarks . unfortunately  he gets pursued by sylvia  voiced by kirsten johnston of   rd rock from the sun    a female orange sloth  who wants sid to go migrating with her . sid eventually teams up with manny  and they became friends .  br    br   meanwhile  nearby a human tribe  soto  voiced by goran visnjic   an evil saber toothed tiger  wants revenge against the tribe  s leader for wiping out half of his pack just by stealing his infant son  roshan  away from him . in the morning  he  diego  and soto  s henchmen  lenny  voiced by alan tudyk   oscar  voiced by diedrich bader   and zeke  voiced by jack black  attacked the tribe  but the leader  s wife escaped with roshan and gave him to manny and sid to look after . eventually  diego joins them  and went on a journey to return roshan back to his tribe  who are also looking for him as well . relax and watch the rest of the movie and find out  okay  besides manny  sid  diego  scrat  sylvia  and roshan  the supporting characters in there including a pack of wolves that roshan  s tribe are using  and not to mention a fat female purple sloth named jennifer  voiced by jane krakowski   and a skinny female yellow sloth named rachel  voiced by lorri bagley   to whom sid shows them roshan as they relax in a tar pit . incidentally  the two rhinos  carl  voiced by cedric the entertainer of pdi  s  madagascar    and frank  voiced by stephen root of pixar  s  finding nemo    who go after sid for ruining their meal and confront manny on a cliff  are simple minor characters . same went for the dodos  who are using melons as their food supply .  br    br   the gags in this movie are very funny . for instance  manny talks through his trunk saying   i  m not going   when jennifer and rachel are out of the tar pit  sid asks jennifer  what do you say if we jump into the gene pool and see what happens   jennifer then responds to him   what do you say if you go jump into the tar pit    rachel also then kicks sid in the waist . sylvia sees diego holding sid by the neck with his teeth  then she asks sid if he  s holding his breath  tells diego to eat him  and promptly walks off .  br    br   since  ice age  is not only a success  but it has  sequels the first one was  ice age the meltdown   which was released in      and the other was  ice age dawn of the dinosaurs   which is going to be releasing next year . i can hardly die waiting to see what  ice age dawn of the dinosaurs  will be like .  ,1
without a doubt this is one of the worst films i  ve ever wasted money on  the plot is  erm sorry  did i say there was a plot  the scariest moment was when . . .  nope can  t think of one  the best special effect that had me hiding under the bed covers was . . .  nope can  t think of one for that either . you knew who the killer was right from the start . there was nothing scary about the whole movie  in fact the only two vaguely interesting bits were when you saw the kid sister  misty  in the shower and when you saw nurse toppan take her top off . this film should only be watched to get an idea of how not to make a horror movie     ,0
princess tam tam is without the trappings of racism  in the way we think of racism in the united states  but there are more subtle  to the american viewer  assertions about ethnic identity during the time . pay attention to alwina  s  baker  placement within shots  how she is addressed by the other characters  the settings around her that all depict her as a  savage  african  and ask yourself if alwina has any shred of agency throughout the film . i don  t want to ruin anything but at the end pay very careful attention  the dichotomy between  eastern  and  western  culture is to say the least offensive  such diction is thankfully disavowed these days . the french have a checkered past as an imperial force throughout the areas depicted  see chris marker  s les statues meurent aussi        and pay attention to the places the european travelers visit while they are in africa  and what does that reflect about their attitudes towards the  other  . i give this film a  because i am a sucker for baker  much of what she did in her professional career  like princes tam tam  that is regressive is certainly overshadowed by her efforts towards integration  her work as a freaking spy  i am gushing  sorry .  however the film for me is captivating because of her performance  besides that it is a telling relic of bygone mentalities .  ,1
  sandra  the making of a woman  is a standout among exploitation films  and is so for two reasons    an excellent  yet effortless  performance by monica gayle  and    the fact that gary graver was at the helm of the project . these two talents  both of whom are quite underrated  make  sandra  a film that should be seen .  br    br   another key element of the film  s success is its realism   there is nothing fake or  hollywood  about this set  in  california film . it is truly a slice of life . the modest house in which sandra lives at the beginning of the film  the simple dresses worn by the character  the scene where sandra wakes up in the morning to find uschi digart bouncing at her front door  and sandra sits on the couch without make  up  while digart tries to sell her some cosmetics  looking truly as if she just woke up  but nevertheless beautiful   the harmless weirdo sandra picks up who likes to make love with her while he wears a bra  the one  room apartment into which sandra moves   all of these elements of the film seem totally real  and as such  the viewer is drawn into sandra  s little world from the beginning and immediately becomes interested in her and wants her to succeed . sandra also makes her case for free love with eloquence and dignity and she comes off with a lot of class .  br    br   this film could have easily failed in less competent hands  and could have gone off in any of the usual sexploitation directions  but the garver  gale team see to it that  sandra  is not only the making of a woman but the making of an excellent film .  ,1
on paper this looked like a great concept average guy on the rebound dates up tight bookish museum curator  who is really a hot superhero who saves the world on a regular basis . however  director ivan reitman and writer don payne  of the  simpson  s   almost fatally miscalculate in having their hero g  girl  played by striking uma thurman  come off as a total nut job as both superhero and secret identity persona jenny johnson . the movie even cops to this in a conversation between jenny and matt saunders  luke wilson  following his rescue by g  girl from the statue of liberty . jenny curiously asks matt what was g  girl like . matt replies   she  s kind of nutty  i think the intent was to have jenny  thurman  be this lonely young woman  who has no one in her life  isolated by her great physical powers . thurman does the best she can  but her jenny is a terrifying mood swing in dire need of prozac . luke wilson is way too breezy in the role reversal of boyfriend and superhero girl friend .  br    br    my super ex  girlfriend  is also a victim of bad timing  coming on the tail end of  superman returns  which plays superhero straight up  so to speak . with all its quirks and inconsistent writing i still thought  my super ex  girlfriend  was funny and enjoyed the movie . given that this is an ivan reitman movie  this could have been a lot better . reitman starts with a great premise  and really squanders it . first off  we all love the hero . here neither jenny nor g  girl is really all that likable . this is surprising for uma thurman  who is normally a charismatic and powerful presence . in the beginning her jenny  g  girl is just plain weird . shocking . because if there is a woman who can play a superhero  she is thurmanshe looks great . only toward the end does her jenny become more sympathetic  instead of caricature . although  my super ex  is not a straight superhero story  rather a romantic comedy of sorts  it does not provide what every superhero mythology requiresa great super villain . here we have professor bedlam aka barry  eddie izzard  who really is evil lite . he is no lex luthor . no plans for global domination . bedlam rather barry does hold a grudge against g  girl  and expectedly it has to do with their shared past . what is bizarre you don  t know who you would rather spend time withbedlam or g  girl  luke wilson  s matt is just  some dude  who happens to hook up with the psycho superhero . one of the annoying things he does is that he confides in his repugnant loser friend vaughn  rainn wilson doing a bad whacked out impersonation  . wilson sometimes plays it a little too dense  and this dilutes his likable charm . this does however work  in the comic sex scene with jenny . matt while dating jenny  g  girl realizes that he is in love with his co  worker hannah  perky anna faris  . so how does matt break up with g  girl  well  it  s not pretty and for the most part hilarious .  br    br   dramatic superhero movies work . romantic comedies with chemistry work . what may be inherently difficult are superhero satires disguised as romantic comedies . everyone loves the hero . however  hero nut job  maybe not . with all uma thurman  s talent she is unable to accomplish this convincingly . and she does not get sufficient support from reitman and payne . thurman and wilson have enough charm and presence to survive their narrative failings .  my super ex  girlfriend  is fun and funny . though given all involved  the movie could have been super .  ,1

if you are expecting to see a lot in the bath of alt    oklar  as it is promised by the tag line  you will be very disappointed to see that the movie consists of nothing but the populist style of alt    oklar regarding most famous issues like sex  marriage and cheating . to much nudity  which seems to appear from nowhere and has no connection or whatsoever to the plot proves that alt    oklar was unsuccessfully to  try something new  as he has quoted . to much sex centered jokes seems to show that alt    oklar had fallen for the famous saying which is  sex sells .  i was hoping to see a very good story told with a very good narration technique . however in the end i found myself sitting down for   minutes and watching alt    oklar  s experimental yet still to much focused on popularism work .  ,0
i wanted to read the other comments before leaving my review and the majority definately rules this movie is aweful  from the acting to the non  realistic animation to the countless errors . i was actually hoping that the flaps would have been extended by a stretch of the imagination  can  t extend flaps without engines  . the landing gear cannot be lowered unless you have electricity . that tiny little fan that was going was not sufficient by any stretch to lower the landing gear . the one thing i thought was quite peculiar is when they landed  the back wheels touched down and then the nose one broke off  thus suspending the plane with both back tires in the air . how did the captain apply left and right brakes to tires that weren  t touching the ground  did they forget the spoilers  word to the director find out all you can about planes before attempting a  plane  movie . sorry for the technical rant  but i give this movie     .  ,0
great documentary about the lives of ny firefighters during the worst terrorist attack of all time . . that reason alone is why this should be a must see collectors item . . what shocked me was not only the attacks  but the  high fat diet  and physical appearance of some of these firefighters . i think a lot of doctors would agree with me that  in the physical shape they were in  some of these firefighters would not of made it to the   th floor carrying over   lbs of gear . having said that i now have a greater respect for firefighters and i realize becoming a firefighter is a life altering job . the french have a history of making great documentary  s and that is what this is  a great documentary . . . . .  ,1
since the little mermaid was one of my favorite disney movies when i was little  i was curious about its sequel .  br    br   the little mermaid  one  is a classic animated feature with top quality everything  a grand music score  and targets a general audience . in contrast  the little mermaid  is targeted primarily at young children  because it is spontaneous  reflects a child  s self perspective  the music is bouncier and less dramatic  and the ending feels like recess .  br    br   the little mermaid  starts out when baby melody is presented to ariel  s side of the family . abruptly without any visual cues to aid the drama  a giant tentacle grabs the baby . i laughed  wait a minute it  s not funny  the baby  s being attacked  okay  i  ll stop laughing . morgana  s crime in broad daylight and her spontaneity  takes away potential drama since it happened so quickly .  br    br   throughout the feature  melody seems superhuman  which i defend is how most children envision themselves . this quality in melody  s character is clearly brought out toward the end when she fights morgana without an inch of fear on her face .  br    br   like the first movie  melody has a lot of ariel  s problems  except the reverse . queen ariel turns out to be like her father by restricting her from the ocean  whereas king triton restricted ariel from the surface . ariel and melody both rebel against their parent .  br    br   the music is more emotionally moving in the first . this sequel has a bunch of songs  but not as much orchestral work went into it . it  s great for little ones  because it doesn  t take an orchestra to impress them .  br    br   the ending in the first movie was strong and uplifting . the sequel ends with a bouncy song and everyone playing in the water . it  s definitely more targeted at kids  because instead of the ending being solemn and leaving you blown away  this ending leaves you thinking   it  s time for recess   ultimately  this movie is fun for kids  so we should let them have fun .  ,0
this movie is about a side of ireland that americans don  t normally see  the narrow  minded religiously prejudiced side of the  friendliest race in the world  . the movie  by the admission of the inhabitants of fethard who are old enough to remember the events  is fairly accurate  though they insist that the film  makers invented some of the more violent scenes just to spice up the action  .  br    br   the movie was very unpopular in ireland as it portrayed the catholic church in a bad light  but the simple fact is that representatives of the catholic church did organise vetoes of minorities  before protestants it was the jews  .  br    br   the film is a fascinating insight into the whole issue of religion in ireland  ,1
it was the worst ending i have ever seen if some one can please tell me how and why the last chick goes crazy and eats the old women in the end . why dose the movie have all those cheap crappy scares in it in the beginning but yet when the first person dies they kill them all off in  minutes  most of the people could act but i do give so credit to the porn stars they did their best . also it had a couple funny parts and kills like when the care taker gets his organs riped out of his ass and then gets choked with it . if this movie had an ending that could make any since i would have given it a  out of   but the ending made no since . the ending sucked but the rest was great  ,0
this film was absolutely awful  i even feel uncomfortable calling it a film . its the typical  mumblecore  movie  with zero plot and a bunch of aimless whiny twenty somethings stumbling around trying to  figure stuff out  . i have tried to give mumblecore a chance  but lets be honest its just horrible .  br    br   i am not out of sync with cinema  i appreciate dogme   films  idioterne is one of my all time favorite films . so i do not mind if a film is cheaply made so long as there is some  any  substance .  br    br   everything in this film is horrid  the acting  the writing  or was it all improvised    the direction  but most of all  above everything else  the camera work was just plain and simple nonsense . the camera was never anywhere logical  there was no consistency . i got to admit being a guy i had heard there was nudity in this film so i thought to myself well even if its horrible at least there  s nudity  yea i know  i  m a jerk  . well thanks to the uber crappy camera  work you never really get to see anything  and the things you do see  trust me  you do not want to see . this film made me want to vomit on numerous levels .  br    br   the dialogue made me want to vomit  the camera  work made me want to vomit  but mostly the idea that this film was praised by some legit critics  well now that more than anything makes me want to vomit .  ,0
a schizophrenic has escaped from a nyc mental hospital and soon teachers start getting offed at st . trinity university . new teacher julie  francine forbes  has to deal with the mess of red herrings . despite a   minute running time  this cheap  o slasher drags on and on until the lame finish where the person you suspect is the killer from the get go is revealed to be as such . director richard haines barely breaks a sweat with some lame stalk  n  slash staging but delivers the grue the early   s audience was probably craving . for all of our amateur anthropologists out there  this was filmed in new yawk in early   s so you can check out all of the culture  beliefs  and practices of living people from that far away place . the film does get some credit for offing the  final girl .  you rarely see that . also  always nice to see a horror movie where a priest is the killer . doth thou not trust the clergy  my beloved film industry  thankfully  this one is only a phony priest and he gets caught . he is still working the moral high ground angle though .  ,0
plato  s run is an entertaining b movie with gary busey . it is a fairly unknown film so one i saw it at a car boot i thought this looks entertaining i was right to . gary busey plays plato smith a tough mercenary who is framed for the assassination of a powerful cuban crime lord now on the run plato must survive long enough to prove his innocence with the help of his friends played by steve bauer  scarface  and action star jeff speaksman  the expert  . what i liked about plato  s run was the way the film never got boring the plot may have been done before but it was still good the acting was fun to watch and the action was quite fun as well especially the climax gary busey makes a good hero ironic since he normally plays the bad guy and steve bauer is good as plato  s sidekick even jeff speaksman makes a good performance and he cant even act well to finish it of plato  s run is an enjoyable effort from nu image films and i give it  out of    ,1
having just seen this on tmc  it  s fresh in my mind . it  s obvious that while the stooges are featured stars  they don  t really run the show . first  they  re broken into  groups  moe  as  shorty  and larry and curly as a pair of vagrants  so there  s not a whole lot of full team work . the love story that fuels the plot is uninteresting  the two ladies are the only ones with any acting ability  there  s another group of musical stooges that are unfunny  unless you consider their attempts at being funny to be sadly buffoonish . the music is tiresome  they drive cars to the ranch and then depend on horses  the dorky western wear is silly  and there  s an awful lot of the movie with no stooges on camera . by the way  this is obviously after curley  s first stroke  and his reduced energy level is clear . vernon dent appears early on in an uncredited role . i loved everything these guys ever did  including all the non  curley stuff  but this little dogie is pretty lousy .  ,0
this may actually be the worst movie that i have ever scene . incoherent would be a compliment . even the end made no sense but it was a tremendous relief that it was finally over . i watched it with a kind of fatalistic fascination to see if it could continue to deteriorate and it did . by the end of this mess i was sorry any of the characters survived and i wasn  t feeling too charitable about the actors either . if you want to watch a train wreck  i recommend hanging out at a train station . even waiting on a deserted train platform beats this mess . apparently i haven  t vented enough to fill up my prescribed ten lines so  at the risk of redundancy  i will say it one more time . this movie is a zero and it would be less if i had a word for an even lower rating . how about minus zero   ,0

yes  he is  . . . no  not because of pintilie likes to undress his actors and show publicly their privies . pintilie is the naked  emperor   so to speak . . .  br    br   it  s big time for someone to state the truth . this impostor is a voyeur  a brat locked in an old man  s body . his abundance of nude scenes have no artistic legitimacy whatsoever . it is     visual perversion he gets his kicks by making the actors strip in the buff and look at their willies . and if he does this in front of the audience  he might eve get a hard  on  did you know that  on the set of  niki ardelean   he used to embarrass poor coca bloss  by telling her  oh  coca  how i wanna f you    she is a great lady  very decent and sensitive  and she became unspeakably ashamed  to his petty satisfaction  and  as a worrying alarm signal about the degree of vulgarity and lack of education in romanian audiences  so many people are still so foolish to declare these visual obscenities  works of art   will anyone have ever the decency to expose the truth of it all   ,0

after watching  the bodyguard  last night  i felt compelled to write a review of it .  br    br   this could have been a pretty decent movie had it not been for the awful camera  work . it was beyond annoying . the angles were all wrong  it was impossible to see anything  especially during the fight sequences . the closeups were even horrible .  br    br   the story has sonny chiba hiring himself out as a bodyguard to anyone willing to lead him to the top of a drug ring . he is approached by judy lee  who is never quite straight with chiba . lee  s involvement in the drug ring is deeper than chiba thought  as the mob and another gang of thugs are after her .  br    br   the story was decent  and despite horrible dubbing  this could have been a good movie . given better direction and editing  i  m sure this would have been a classic kung foo movie . as it is  it  s more like another cheesy    s action movie .  br    br   note the opening sequence has a quote familiar to  pulp fiction  fans  and then continues to a karate school in times square that is in no way related to the rest of the movie .  br    br   rating  out of    ,0
a young woman who is a successful model  and is also engaged to be married  and who has twice attempted suicide in the past  is chosen by a secretive and distant association of catholic priests to be the next  sentinel  to the gateway to hell  which apparently goes through a creepy old  but well maintained brooklyn apartment building . its tenants take the stairway up and can reincarnate themselves  but apparently can  t escape as long as a sentinel is there to block the way . the previous one  john carradine  is about dead  so she  by fate or whatever  becomes the next one  and the doomed must get her to kill herself in order for them to be free . lots of interesting details lie under the surface  her relationship with her father  the stories of the doomed  her fianc  so one can pass this off as cheap exploitation horror  but given the sets  the great cast  and overall level of bizarreness  this is definitely worth seeing .  ,1
this was talked about to death by the critics when it honestly isn  t that great . sure   chaos  and  inside man  are literally the same movie  just with variations in suspense . but i found  chaos  more enjoyable because it was fast paced kinda like the silly film  swordfish .  the reason this film is more popular is because this got released in the states and  chaos  was aired all around the world at film festivals and foreign theaters  but has yet to find a distributor in the u . k . and u . s . a .  br    br   it  s true that this film makes lots of tributes to classic films like dog day afternoon and other spike lee films  but that doesn  t mean that it is a pleasant film to watch .  br    br   watch it if nothing else is on t . v .  but you  ll probably get bored with after awhile .  ,0
  cosby   in my opinion  is a must  see cbs hit  i  m not sure if i  ve never seen every episode  but i still enjoyed it . it  s hard to say which one is my favorite . also  i really loved the theme song . if you ask me  even though i liked everyone  it would have been nice if madeline kahn hadn  t passed away during the show  s run . since that happened  i  ve always wondered what the show would have been like . everyone always gave a good performance  the production design was spectacular  the costumes were well  designed  and the writing was always very strong . in conclusion  even though it can be seen on tbs now  i strongly recommend you catch it just in case it goes off the air for good  ,1
american film makers decided to make a film they think is japanese . the characters all badly represented  the actors are not even japanese and the set is cheap  unreal and definitely doesn  t represent kyoto in early   ties and   ties . who ever read the book understand that the script writers didn  t add any extra value to differentiate the movie from the script . worse  they even changed the original plot line with a few goofs . rob marshall is using for his two main characters two well known chinese actors who joined before in crouching tiger hidden dragon . marshall probably saw one chinese movie and tho they represent japanese culture . seeing those two actors together again even makes the movies more ridiculous . quentine tarantino  s last scene in kill bill   is ten times more japanese made than that of this movie .  ,0
as the celebration of christmas has evolved through the years  whether one concentrates on the religious or the secular traditions  it is a time when people are supposed to behave a little better to each other . that has somehow slipped past one ebenezer scrooge  merchant and money lender in   th century london .  br    br   as his nephew points out to his uncle  he doesn  t keep christmas in any way because scrooge feels the whole thing is humbug . the humanity in scrooge was driven out long ago  he  s a hard case  a whole lot like his   th century counterpart  mr . potter of bedford falls  new york .  br    br   but as charles dickens told this tale  redemption is not too late for any of us and a lonely ghost and three spirits visit scrooge and show him how .  br    br   a christmas carol is such a timeless holiday classic that we sometimes forget that it is as much a social commentary of   th century great britain as oliver twist was . the characters in this film are middle and lower class . the cratchits are a couple of rungs above the street people in oliver twist  but they are having to struggle to stay up there . still love and happiness radiate their home  no thanks to the guy bob cratchit works for .  br    br   like george bailey who did a whole lot of good in his life and just had to be reminded how much  ebenezer scrooge needed a wake up call as to the potentiality he still had for doing some good in this old world .  br    br   patrick stewart in his live performances and filmed play has pretty much taken over the part of scrooge . but george c . scott captures the old miser pretty well in this film . the meanness of him  but with a trace of sadness that makes us root for him to change . scott joins a fine tradition of people like reginald owen and alastair sim who  ve both done great interpretations of scrooge .  br    br   among the supporting roles i particularly enjoyed david warner as bob cratchit and edward woodward as a hearty and stern spirit of christmas present .  br    br   according to imdb this is one of   versions of a christmas carol made that they have archived and it is one of the best .  ,1
these slasher pics are past their sell by date  but this one is good fun .  br    br   the valentine cards themselves are witty  and well thought out .  br    br   the film has one peach of a line . . .  he  s no angel . . . .  when he in fact is angel    watching buffy reruns will never be the same   br    br   the cast is a sizzling display of young talent  but the story does not give them enough real depth . denise richards on the dvd extras seemed to think the girls on set bonded well together and this would give the feeling that you empathised with their characters . sorry but no   br    br   the direction is very good  managing to show very little actual gore  and relying on your imaginations implied threat . much can be said also for the similar manner in which miss richards and heigel do not remove their clothes . . .     br    br   essentially  the main directorial plus  lies within the  borrowing  of various other ideas from previous slasher flicks . psycho  s shower scene is tributed  along with halloween  s  masking  .  br    br   murdering someone hiding in a bodybag though is a pretty original one as far as i know     br    br   light viewing  not very scary but a few good jump moments . if it was a choice between the hole and this though  choose the hole . slasher movies have had their day  and this is just another slasher . a very good slasher  but nothing groundbreaking     ,1
famous for introducing the world to hedy lamarr and full frontal nudity  but it  s oh so much more . in fact  this is one of the pinnacles of cinematic poetry  up there with some of the seminal works of     s art cinema  in the same prestigious group as under the roofs of paris  tabu  olympia  and even l  atalante . it  s nearly a silent  relying mostly on its miraculous images  and also its fantastic  symphonic score by giuseppe becce . it  s a masterpiece of cinematography and music  yes  and also of editing  direction  writing  and acting . a good    of the film moves along perfectly . machat seems an expert at using motifs . perhaps not as subtle as it could be  and perhaps a bit overused  but the appearances of objects like insects  lights  and horses carry the story forward beautifully . the small snatches of dialogue are  thankfully  unintrusive . they don  t jar as much as one would imagine . the final bit is odd  to say the least . reminiscent of russian silents  we have a montage of workers . this barely makes sense in the course of the narrative  but it  s so gorgeously done that i refuse to harp too much on that flaw . ecstasy is a film that is desperately in need of rediscovery . it belongs amongst the best films ever made .  ,1
i thought this movie was stunning  with completely outstanding performances by valentina cervi  artemisia gentileschi  .  br    br   cervi portrays artemisia so beautifully  with tentative yet confidant mannerisms  her hands mapping out an idea before moving her models into place . the passion to which artemisia gives to her art is just spectacular to watch .  br    br   although not each character was overtly beautiful  this made the film more realistic as the facial hair and clothing was perfect for that point in time .  br    br   overall i thought this film was fantastic .  ,1
i read the book   years in tibet  from heinrich harrer and was fascinated of it . then i immediately grabbed the dvd and started to watch the movie . i remember the first time i saw it back in    i kinda liked it . well  now i watched it again in full knowledge of the book it is based on . and soon i realized how wrong it all was told  br    br   when they enter lhasa the people start to stick their tongues out of their mouths and thewlis and pitt have the impression that its the way to say hello in tibet  so they greet back . . . in the book harrer explains  that sticking the tongue out is a sign of absolute humbleness and loyalty in tibet and they may do it in front of the dalai lama but certainly not for these two europeans  not only the mother but even the dalai lama himself was wearing glasses in the public . in the book harrer mentions  that no one in tibet wore glasses to that time  sorry forgot the reason  but its explained in the book too  . the young dalai lama did  but only when he was alone and nobody could see him  and what about that mao tse tung lookalike  destroying the mandala in front of the young  living buddha    childish . . . and the tailor made harrer and aufschnaiter tibetan clothes not european designer suits  why are so many events that really happened eliminated from the story  just to fill the time with a fictional love interest  the female tailor . . .  that is completely unimportant  just like the whole story about harrers son  rolf . not one word is mentioned about him or even any family member of harrer in the book . but that was ok for me because   years in tibet  is not a book about harrers person . its about tibet . i  m very disappointed by this  adaption  of the famous book . and i bet heinrich harrer was  too . . .  stars  just for the cinematography .  ,0
in director sooraj barjatya  s vivah     something delhi boy shahid kapur finds himself smitten by the demure  small  town girl his father has selected for him to marry . drawn to her innocence and simplicity  shahid agrees to the marriage barely moments after he  s met her at her home in madhupur  and the young lady in question amrita rao seems equally floored by her charming suitor . the marriage is fixed for six months later  and the couple find themselves in the first throes of young  budding love  their geographical distance notwithstanding . but amrita  who  s been raised by her uncle and her aunt after her parents  death  is struck by a horrible calamity just hours before the marriage . and then  it  s up to shahid to play the honourable lover and to embrace her unconditionally . much in the same vein as hum aapke hain koun and hum saath saath hain  barjatya  s new film vivah too is on one level a family drama with an extremely idealistic premise . but sadly  the plot of this new film comes off looking way too outdated  even more far  fetched than those regressive ekta kapoor soaps . and the problem is clear  you just can  t relate to such squeaky  clean characters who don  t have one bad bone in their bodies . there are many things that work in favour of and against hindi films  and timing is one such important factor . twenty  five years ago  perhaps the plot of vivah may not have felt like such a stretch  but today it just seems like the product of a mind stuck in a time warp . perhaps the film  s only saving grace is the fact that it oozes sincerity from start to finish  you can make out right away that the filmmaker  s intention is not to deceive . judging both by barjatya  s previous films and by closely examining this new one you can safely declare that barjatya believes in a perfect world  he believes in his good  as  gold characters  he believes that large families can live together happily under the same roof without the slightest bumps . but alas  he  s unable to translate his vision to the screen . it  s difficult to overlook how one  dimensional his protagonists are  shahid and amrita  both virtuous and virginal  i mean  think about it  the first time they hold hands is an hour and twenty minutes into the film . barjatya may think he  s returning to his maine pyar kiya roots with vivah  but truth is that the reason we embraced salman and bhagyashree in that film  or even salman and madhuri in hum aapke hain koun is because they had such fantastic chemistry . because although they were created out of the same mould as shahid and amrita in vivah  those pairs had mischief and masti . shahid and amrita are just insipid and boring . for a film that relies so heavily on music to narrate its story  the filmmaker chooses a string of   s  style tunes that only further slacken the film  s deadening pace . but if i had to choose just one reason to explain why vivah doesn  t work for me  it  s because i  m not sure i can relate to any of the characters who inhabit barjatya  s story . to some perhaps  vivah will give hope  that a perfect world like this is actually out there somewhere . but i  m a little cynical i guess . so  give me the coquettish madhuri of hum aapke hain kaun  give me the bratty salman of maine pyar kiya  i  ll even take that mischievous karisma kapoor of hum saath saath hain . but save me from these dullards . you know  some marriages aren  t made in heaven . this one  s vivah   ,0
can any movie become more naive than this  you cant believe a piece of this script . and its ssooooo predictable that you can tell the plot and the ending from the first   minutes . the leading actress seems like she wants to be barbie  but she doesn  t make it  the doll has more acting skills  .  br    br   the easiness that the character passes and remains in a a music school makes the phantom of the opera novel seem like a historical biography . i wont even comment on the shallowness of the characters but the one good thing of the film is madsen  s performance which manages to bring life to a melo  like one  dimensional character .  br    br   the movie is so cheesy that it sticks to your teeth . i can think some   year old britney  obsessed girls shouting  o  do give us a break  if we want fairy tales there is always the brothers grimm book hidden somewhere in the attic  . i gave it  instead of one only for virginia madsen .  ,0
as a former  time okinawan karate world champion  i like movies about sacrifice for sport . but this movie is about so much more . this movie is so good and so deep . i have recently been plagued by very serious injury and pretty much a disastrous lack of passion . almost lights out for me . and this silly little movie touched me so deep that like out of a daze it reminded me about what life is supposed to be about . this is a movie about living . living your life for yourself and respect for others . empowerment . god  bless  bend it like beckham  i believe it is a true gem .  ,1
spoilers all too often  hollywood  s shakespeare adaptations entertaining pieces of cinema . beautifully shot they are well performed and faithful to the text . films including branagh  s  henry v  and      s  much ado about nothing  are powerful pieces of work . watching  love  s labour  s lost  therefore  it  s such a huge disappointment for expectation to be so hideously thrown to waste . sadly  love  s labour  s lost  is awful  the king of navarre  alessandro nivola  and his friends have forsaken drink and women for three years to focus on their studies . plans begin to fall apart however when the enigmatic princess of france  alicia silverstone  and her entourage arrive . soon love is in the air and philosophy is off the prince  s mind .  br    br   from the start  you realise that this film is not quite shakespeare . cleverly relocated into a     s musical by ken branagh  the plot is still there and the script remains  but now it has been sacrificed in favour of dire musical taste . classics like  the way you look tonight    let  s face the music and dance    i  m in heaven  are all destroyed by weak singing and a strong feel that they just don  t belong here .  br    br   aside from weak singing  we are also treated to an increasingly large number of awkward performances by regular stars . ken branagh and friends might enjoy making this film  but they provide us with a stomach turning collection of roles .  br    br   the main eight actors  four men  four women  are all equally dire  and the only positive on their behalf is a vast improvement on the truly dreadful timothy spall .  br    br   in fact  only one individual leaves the film worthy of any praise and that  s the consistently magnificent nathan lane . lane has proved over the years that he is a comedy genius and in this feature he once again adds an air of humour to the jester costard .  br    br   there  s little else to be said really .  love  s labour  s lost  deserves mild praise for branagh  s original take on an old tale . unfortunately though  that  s where the positives end . weakly acted  performed  sang and constructed   love  s labour  s lost  is perhaps the weakest shakespeare adaptation of the last forty years . it should be avoided like the plague and should never have been made . a poor  disappointing choice by branagh and here  s hoping his next effort is better .  ,0
production line collection of fart jokes that pretends  babe  was never made the writers clearly hoped that the gimmick of seeing animals talk would be enough to keep the movie going . it  s not . eddie murphy sells out yet again as a doctor who rediscovers his forgotten childhood gift for understanding the incessant and witless chatter of guinea pigs  tigers  rats  dogs and pigeons . the voice cast is impressive  albert brooks  julie kavner  reni santoni  john leguizamo  garry shandling  ellen degeneres  paul reubens  brian doyle  murray  but the script is so unimaginative  charmless and depressingly unfunny that the whole thing rattles down the bin chute pretty quickly .  ,0
this had to be one of the worst movies i  ve ever seen and i  m   years old and a football fan . i went expecting to see a football movie . about   minutes into it  i began to wonder exactly how such a bad movie  particularly the acting  could have gotten into a theater . about half way through  i whispered to my husband that it was awful and he explained to me the facts behind the movie . although i was a little offended  and can see how some could be very offended if they were not christian  at being preached to in a movie theater  it wasn  t that big a deal . it was  however  a big deal to be subjected to such predictability and unrealistic behavior and  above all  the quality of the acting . it is an appropriate movie for a church outing but to be shown in a church auditorium and not in a theater . do i go to church  yes . do i want to go to church when i attend a movie  no . would i recommend this movie  absolutely not     ,0
i wasn  t aware of steve mcqueen in     . i only knew that i was extremely frightened about going to see this film .  i  d been devastated by the movie  trantula  at age seven . . . but i was ten now  . the  st scene where the blob crawls up the farmer  s probing stick and engulfs his hand was enough to make me want to leave the theater . but i stayed and suffered through each of our monster  s attacks . i felt such horror when steve and his girl barely made it out of the doctor  s office  poor doc   and even more when the blob entered a movie theater and devoured a large portion of the audience . . . so many in fact that it oooooozzzzzzed out of the front doors  too huge now to fit through just one . it seemed indestructible and unlimited in growth potential  and when it trapped poor steve in a sieve  like diner  he seemed like a sure dinner to be .  br    br   to say that the blob was cold would be a modern day description  but in the end  better icy than scaring and mentally rupturing little kids .  br    br   i remember walking home that evening with my uncle nick  trying to act brave . he knew i was in trouble  and when i got into bed that night i could not only feel the blob in the room  but when i summoned up the courage to look down at the floor  there the red pulsating  heart  like hungry dude sat  waiting for me to try and get up and go to the bathroom . it took months to recover .  br    br   i  m   years old now . . . i  ve made it .  br    br   of course the blob wasn  t destroyed .  ,1

four stories written by robert bloch about various people who live in a beautiful  old mansion and what happens to them . the first has denholm elliott as a novelist who sees the killer he  s writing about come to life . some spooky moments and the twist at the end was good . the second has peter cushing becoming obsessed with a wax figure resembling his dead wife . the third has christopher lee who has a child  chloe franks  and is scared of her . it all leads up to a pretty scary ending  although the ending in the story was much worse  . the last is an out and out comedy with jon petwee and ingrid pitt  both chewing the scenery  and a cape that turns people into vampires  there  s also a cute line about christopher lee playing dracula .  br    br   this is a good horror anthology   nothing terrifying but the first one and the ending of the third gave me a few pleasurable little chills . also the fourth one is actually very funny and pitt makes a very sexy vampire  also the house itself looks beautiful . . . and very creepy . it  s well  directed with some nice atmospheric touches . a very good and unusual movie score too . all in all a good little horror anthology well worth seeking out . try to see it on dvd   the lions gate one looks fantastic with strong colors and great sound .  ,1
perhaps i would have liked this film more if i wasn  t so attached to the characters in henry fool . to those who  ve never seen henry fool  i wouldn  t worry . as hartley jokingly said in his introduction to the film at tiff  the film has lots of exposition and explanations .  br    br   this film is very heavy in plot  which keeps the film moving . there are many humorous moments and the film certainly has hartley  s trademark humour and rhythm of dialogue . over all  a technically well made film and sure to satisfy new fans of hartley who are just beginning explore his work . as for the older fans who loved his earlier works like trust and amateur  this film could go either way . i have mixed feelings about the film and hartley  s later films in general . what hartley does best is setting his stories in small situations  focusing on the intimate and idiosyncratic ways in which his characters interact with each other . since his late   s and onward  his films have widened in scope in terms of subject matter . mass media in no such thing  religion in the book of life and now terrorism in fay grim . i don  t know if hartley  s talents are suited to such big subject matter or if he  s able to do it justice .  br    br   strangely enough  the film can still be reduced to intimate relationships  a simple love story about a woman who goes to seek out the husband she loves . the only problem is  i  ve seen henry fool and everyone seems incredibly out of character in this film . you can tell this film was written long after henry fool was finished without any intention of a sequel . somehow  the terrorist plot feels conveniently tacked on through the use of henry  s books of confessions as a macguffin  in the hitchcockian sense  . fay  s motivations for finding henry seemed motivated purely by the needs of the plot rather than what being faithful to who fay was as person in henry fool .  br    br   i guess i  m slightly disappointed in the film because it  s not true to the characters in the henry fool and it doesn  t exactly work as a straight ahead thriller . there  s too much irony and wryness in hartley  s approach to such as big topic as terrorism . it somehow works and doesn  t work at the same time . all i could say  you would either love or hate the film depending on your take on hartley  s work and how well you know hartley  s work . fans of henry fool  be severely warned for a disappointment . for the rest  welcome to the world of hal hartley and enjoy the ride .  ,1
who would have thought that such an obscure little film could be so haunting and touching  i am really impressed . it  s a shame that more people have not seen it . i loved  as always  hans zimmer  s score . and what a directorial debut by bernard rose  yet i wonder if i should call this a horror film . it could easily be argued that it is a fantasy or a drama as well . well  regardless  i love the interpretive potential it has . everything and everyone in anna  s  played by charlotte burke  dreams represents a real conflict in her life . . . the house itself  the tree  mark  the lighthouse  etc . it is the many details such as these that make the film so good for repeated viewings . i hope i come across another little movie as loaded with emotion and psychological meaning as this one some time soon .  ,1
 . . . and i love it . lots of special effects  and for a movie that  s not made on mega budget  this movie really does great job of creating a fantasy masterpiece . i  m one of the guys who didn  t understand the story at all  but this was still a great flick to watch . it  s definitely up there in standards surpassing bored of the rings  and on par with movies like harry potter . which is saying a lot for a movie again  made on a fraction of the budget of these international hits .  br    br   one thing i really love about this movie is that it so stretches the envelope of adventure movie to come out of hong kong . the topic is exotic and original . production quality is unlike anything seen coming out of hk for fantasy action movie  and acting is great .  br    br   one of the best movies to come out of hong kong  this is the infernal affairs of hong kong fantasy movie  and i hope they  ll continue working in this area  until they surpass hollywood adventure movies .  br    br   just fantastic .  ,1
this was a great movie  even though there was only about   people including myself there it was great  my friend and i laughed a lot . my mom even enjoyed it . there was two middle aged women there and a mid   year old there and they seemed to enjoy it . i love the part where corky and ned are like both liking nancy and stuff its cute lol . and when she gets her roadster and ned is there . yeah this was a great movie even thought people underestimated it lol . go see it i bet you  ll enjoy it   i really enjoyed it and so did my friend .  br    br   people were so tough on this movie and they hadn  t even seen it . i bet next time they will give the movie and actresses a chance . they all did a great job in my opinion . but if you have young kids its still appropriate . i will probably take my  year old niece to watch it too .  ,1
this is a fascinating account of the hunt for the soviet union  s first known serial killer . i had tuned in  just expecting a half  decent tv movie  but found myself drawn by the compelling way the story was told . as others have said  there is much to admire here that is sadly lacking in many big screen releases .  br    br   much of the credit must go to chris gerolmo  whose intelligent screenplay and direction draw the viewer in  until it is impossible not to feel emotionally involved . the acting by the whole cast is also superb  especially that of the two leads  stephen rea and donald sutherland . their convincing portrayals give their character arcs a great deal of credibility  and the scene where they have their first committee meeting after perestroika is genuinely touching .  br    br   if you prefer your crime films with a bit more depth and a little less sheen  i strongly recommend you look out for  citizen x  .  br    br    ,1
  how is it that everyone can understand each other perfectly without devices like universal translators or translator microbes  did the creators of this show realize that people who were taken from different parts of the earth  in different time frames  attilla the hun wasn  t a contemporary of preliterate hellenic cultures  nor were the vikings contemporary to the pyramid builders  speak different languages and can never develop a language so similar to modern day english  except for the inflections they  do not  use   which has been influenced by latin  ancient greek  danish and french   br    br    cultural differences can  t be overcome so easily  trust has to be won  yet everywhere the team arrives they are welcomed without any suspicion and start ordering people around like they are their appointed leaders . of course real fans would comment that they are perceived as gods . the people they meet should be shocked by their technology and accuse them of witchcraft and the like .  br    br    historical background none . visually it might vaguely remind you of greek or viking culture  but anyone can dress in a bunch of tablecloths or run to a local costume rental for a plastic helmet with horns and claim to look the part . a small  town theater group probably has better props .  br    br    boring  another lame canuck production  which inexplicably ran for ten long years . as a kids show it could make the grade  but anyone who has a little knowledge about human behavior and language couldn  t bear to even watch the first twelve episodes of season   like i just did . i very much wanted to believe i had found a decent sci  fi show  otherwise i would shut it of and cleansed my computer of this refuge after the first five minutes   ,0
prison is set in wyoming where work on a new prison has hit a problem so the state board decide to re  open an old state penitentiary that has been closed for   years  warden eaton sharpe  lane smith  is put in charge .    odd prisoners are shipped in  they are put to work fixing the rundown prison up including burke  viggo mortensen  who is ordered to break into the old execution chamber  he duly obliges but when he penetrates the bricked up door an intense beam of light shoots out  all the electrics  gas  fire around the prison goes crazy for a few minutes . burke has unwittingly unleashed a deadly evil force which is in the mood for some killing  no  one is safe . . .  br    br   directed by renny harlin i thought prison was a poor late    s horror flick that seemed to forget about the small point of having a story . the script was by empire pictures regular c . courtney joyner who was responsible for writing such  classics  as class of            puppet master iii toulon  s revenge        puppet master vs . demonic toys       amongst other low budget horror crap that even i haven  t heard of  seems to take itself very seriously . the biggest problems i have with prison are that it  s far too slow  it  s over   minutes into the film before the  evil force  is even released although the pace does pick up towards the end but by then it was too little too late as far as i was concerned  then there  s the fact there  s no discernible storyline here at all . for a start it never tries to explain why there  s an  evil force  bricked up in the old execution chamber  it never explains why this force decides to kill random inmates when it  s supposed to be out on a revenge mission or why it just doesn  t kill warden sharpe straight away  no explanation is given to where burke fits into it even though he looks exactly the same as the prisoner who was electrocuted  has come back  there  s no real explanation as to how the warden is connected to everything that  s going on apart from two early nightmare sequences in which he seems to be remembering something although it  s never revealed what it is or why . to be honest i couldn  t really give you a plot synopsis as the film doesn  t have a rigid story which it follows all the way through . the character  s are dull  forgettable  the murders are few  far between  the pacing is way off  the whole film is a mess  even ghosts can  t shoot straight when it comes to trying to shoot the hero . a less than satisfactory way to spend    odd minutes  there really are better things you could be doing .  br    br   director harlin  s full american flick debut he does a good job  there  s a decent atmosphere but after over an hour of constant drab  dull  dark prison cells  corridors i started to get bored . i just think the look of the film is far too repetitive  bland  frankly lifeless . i didn  t think it was scary  the gore is pretty tame apart from the best moment in the entire film when a police guard gets killed when a load of barb wire wraps itself around his body  face with a nice close up of his throat being torn open . other than that there  s a burnt corpse  a mangled body which falls from the ceiling  very little else . there is a scene when the warden burns all the prisoner mattresses in front of them  then makes them stand all night in their underwear in the yard  i was watching this scene  thought that you  d never get away with doing something like that . over here prisoners have rights  if the warden did something like that there would be a national outcry from all those humanitarians  every prisoner would sue the warden  the prison service  the government for everything they had  they  d win   br    br   with a supposed budget of about           prison actually had a pretty healthy budget although it doesn  t really look like it on screen  sure there  s a decent cast  the few special effects that are included are good but overall it  s set in the same location with limited ambition . prison was actually shot in a real wyoming state prison so it certainly looks the business . the acting is alright  prison proves that sometimes hollywood stars not only have one crap horror film skeleton in their closets but in the case of mortensen he has two with this  the awful the return of the texas chainsaw massacre       both of which i  m sure he  d like to forget about . . .  br    br   prison is a dull  lifeless  colourless  humourless waste of    minutes  despite one good gore scene i didn  t like it at all as i actually prefer my films to have a story rather than seemingly random events  incidents cobbled together with no narrative sense .  ,0
saw this a couple times on the sundance channel several years ago and received a nice cinematic jolt to the system . a semi  surreal yet hard edged take on modern media culture  or the lack of it   focusing on some seriously wacked  way  beyond  the  hollywood  fringe dwellers . it had an amusing early performance from mark ruffalo  and some memorable cinematography from the dp who did the polish brothers movies . there was a savage umcompromising humor and a weirdly original feel to it that definitely set it apart . this film had cult classic written all over it  and i  m surprised it  s not yet out on dvd .  br    br   hopefully soon .  ,1
franco rossi  s     six  hour italian mini  series of quo vadis is a very curious beast  creating an absolutely convincing ancient roman world shot in matter of fact fashion  very few long shots  no big cityscapes   but playing the drama down so much in favour of allusions to classical literature and history that the story constantly gets lost in the background .  br    br   the shifting structure  much of episode one is played out via voice over letters  and lack of narrative urgency makes the full six  hour version simultaneously demanding and undemanding  and certainly far too often uninvolving  but it has something going for it . the two main strengths are the characterisation of petronius  a thankfully dubbed frederic forrest  whose own voice would almost certainly flatten his dialogue  as a man whose spent so long looking for an astute angle to survive court life that he  s become incapable of experiencing emotion  and klaus maria brandauer  s unique take on nero as a wannabe actor whose every move and action is calculated on how his  audience  will receive it . elsewhere  max von sydow briefly appears in a few episodes  being rewarded with the show  s most impressive and genuinely moving scene here he encounters a child as he attempts to leave rome . it  s the kind of thing the show could do with more of  but it seems all too often to flatten every potentially emotional  inspiring or exciting moment under it  s relentlessly low  key direction .  br    br   unfortunately francesco quinn makes a staggeringly anonymous hero  blending in with the walls and coming over less as a roman officer than that quiet  slightly gormless but inoffensive guy who works in the same office as you who never says much at office parties  you know  the one who you think is called dave or something like that . the budgetary limitations are very visible once its meet the lions time for the christians and ursus battle with the bull is so determinedly low key that it just passes over you before the show just abruptly loses interest and suddenly ends .  br    br   not a trip i can particularly recommend  i  m afraid  but if you do embark on it it  s one not entirely without its small rewards .  ,0
i am a huge stooges fan but the one and only redeeming quality this movie has is that curley is in it . done long before he started drinking heavily he is his classic self in this  and larry  s not bad either  . moe  s character is a straight part  mostly  and this movie would be better named  the curley and larry movie  . not that any of the stooges movies were very good  in my opinion   but as one commenter here said  how sad it is that this movie had real potential . the casting was good  it was well directed  filmed  and edited  but the story line tried to be about something serious with just some stooges antics and musical numbers  which i guess were good back then  thrown in . the best thing you can do for yourself during this movie should you actually believe that it has to be better than mowing the lawn and taking out the trash  which is subject to debate  is to wait for curley  larry scenes and sleep or find something in the kitchen to eat during the rest of it .  ,0
for those who never saw a chorus line onstage and their only exposure to the story was this film  this film is ok as movie musicals  nothing special  just ok . i have seen the show on broadway  times and even auditioned for a touring company of the show once and for someone who pretty much memorized the original production  the     film version is so dreadful on so many levels that i don  t even know where to begin . first of all  for those who have never auditioned for a theatrical production  let me assure you that irl when you audition for a play  the director  producer  and choreographer never ask personal questions and don  t give a crap about why you wanted to become a performer . a real theatrical audition  whether it be for a play or a musical  rarely takes more than five minutes . if you  re auditioning as a dancer  you get shown a    bar dance combination once  you do it  and then they decide immediately whether you  re in or out . michael bennett  s original concept of the show was to flesh out the lives of dancers and introduce to the uninitiated the passion for performing and why so many sacrifice so much for so little . the play is about these dancers . first of all  director richard attenborough took so much focus off the dancers by beefing up the cassie  zach relationship and by casting michael douglas as zach . in the play  you never see zach . . . he is just a voice in the back of the theater and his relationship with cassie is barely touched upon . cassie shown in the cab in traffic trying to get to the audition and upstairs talking to larry  a character who is not even in the play  was all added for the movie and took so much focus off what the story is about . major musical numbers were cut or rethought . the opening number in the play  i hope i get it  shows all of the dancers doing a jazz and ballet combination and then people get eliminated . in the movie they jam three hundred dancers onstage together and show them in closeup to disguise the fact that they have cast people in the film who can  t dance  can you say  audrey landers   .  goodbye    goodbye    hello love   a brilliant vocal exploration of these dancers  childhood  s jaundiced memories was reworked as  surprise  surprise  mainly a vehicle for the late gregg burge as richie . the show  s most famous song   what i did for love  which in the show was a touching allegory sung by the entire cast about what they give up to dance  becomes just another standard love song in the film  performed tiredly by a miscast allyson reed as cassie . jeffrey hornaday  s choreography for the film is dull and unimaginative and doesn  t hold a candle to michael bennett  original staging and when you  re making a movie about dancers  the choreography has to be special . there are a couple of good dancers in the film  the previously mentioned gregg burge as richie  michelle johnston as bebe  and janet jones as judy  but they are hardly given the opportunity to show what they can do  yet audrey landers  who can barely walk and chew gum at the same time  is given one of the show  s best numbers   dance    looks  .  i will admit that the finale   one  is dazzling  but you have to wait almost two hours for that . i would say that if you never saw a chorus line onstage  this film might be worth a look  but if you are a devotee of the original broadway musical . . . be afraid . . . be very afraid .  ,0
what the bleep do we know is a deluded and haphazard look at the mysteries of the universe . we are presented with a parade of apparent experts  none of whom are named  who ramble and pontificate in a thoroughly unscientific manner . their interviews are chopped up into aggravatingly small segments and dispersed throughout some flashy cgi and banal mini  plots .  br    br   the film pilfers themes from science  philosophy  theology and politics  minces them together without any regard for accuracy  and then somehow extracts a few prosaic and absurd conclusions . we are led to believe that quantum physics is telling us the purpose of our existence  and any other difficult to answer question the film  makers would like to point their finger at .  br    br   it is riddled errors and logical non  sequiturs . how did we start at quantum mechanics and end up with this pseudo  scientific spirituality and mysticism  it  s like saying  two plus two equals four  therefore i can move objects with my mind  .  br    br   there is nothing original in this film  and almost nothing that is accurate . any discriminating viewer will be annoyed by heavy  handed editing  intrusive and pointless special effects and general lack of substance . educated viewers will be frustrated to tears by the violence done to science and every other subject this film touches on .  ,0
  i  ll take you there  tells of a woebegone man who loses his wife to another and finds an unlikely ally in a blind date . unlike most romantic comedies  this little indie is mostly tongue  in  cheek situational comedy featuring rogers and sheedy with little emphasis on romance . a sort of road trip flick with many fun and some poignant moments keeps moving  stays fresh  and is a worthwhile watch for indie lovers .  ,1
if you want scream or anything like the big  studio horror product that we get forced on us these days don  t bother . this well  written film kept me up thinking about all it had to say . importance of myth in our lives to make it make sense  how children interpret the world  and the violence in it   our ransacking of the environment and ignorance of its history and legends . . all here  but not flatly on the surface . you could technically call it a  monster movie  even though the wendigo does not take physical form until the end  and then it  s even up to you and your beliefs as to what  s happening with the legendary spirit  beast . some standard thriller elements for those looking just for the basics and the film never bores  though in fact the less you see of the creature  the better . fessenden successfully continues george romero  s tradition of using the genre as parable and as a discussion forum while still keeping us creeped out .  ,1
i was looking forward to seeing john carpenter  s episode in season  because his first  cigarette burns  was by far the best from season   and i did like other episodes from that season  . oh  how i was disappointed .  br    br   in fairness to carpenter i think the primary problem with this episode was absolutely horrible writing . the characters  aside from the subject matter  seemed to behave and speak as though they were written for an episode of walker  texas ranger . the acting was bad  and i normally like ron perlman a lot  but i can only blame them so much because the writing was so horrible . i  m not going to try to guess what the writers were trying to do because that would be useless but it appeared as though they were trying to mix horror  obviously  with some form of social commentary on abortion and religion . in this case  not surprisingly  it seemed a chance to bash a certain variety or religious nuts as well as fanatical anti  abortionists . and i am in favor of both aims but it was done so horribly that i was embarrassed to watch characters act and speak with such stupid inconsistency . this failed totally to offer any worthwhile opinion on the subjects and the horror element failed as well alongside such inept writing .  br    br   while i don  t think carpenter can be blamed for most of the badness here i will say he did choose to direct the teleplay and therefore has that to be held responsible for . there are a couple small bits that i found nice  hence the  stars i gave it .  br    br   the actual gore and monster effects were good  but the cgi gore  two separate gunshots to the head  were so obviously inferior quality cgi they should  ve never been given the ok . i  m generally very critical of cgi but not because i have a problem with it in principle . i have a problem with the execution of it . the technology  while amazing in some respects  is not good enough to match  real  effects  whether they be miniatures or gore especially when it is supposed to match something organic and  or alive  and therefore shouldn  t be used until they are . cgi can be used well in small amounts or obviously if the whole film is animated .  br    br   i  ll also take this opportunity to note that the show title  masters of horror  is a bad title to have . there simply aren  t many actual  masters of horror  around . maybe two or three . if the show were called  tale of horror  or something like that it would be fine . but as it stands the criteria for directing one of these episodes  and therefore being criticized for not being a  master of horror  is that they have directly at least one horror film in their career . and it didn  t even have to be a good one .  ,0
having previously seen the abridged print presented by david shepard  i finally got a hold of a complete   or nearer complete version  which was about   minutes compared to the    minute version more widely distributed . the shepard print for image entertainment is certainly of superior quality  and the best parts are there  but it  s nonetheless good to see the rest of the film and fill in some loose story ends .  br    br   in the shepard print  the film ends with mary stating   you see  i  ve changed my mind   i  m never going home .  yet  in the complete version  mary and kenneth driscoll end their relationship soon after that scene  mary returns home to the country  and driscoll rekindles his relationship with vivian . this additional footage develops the character vivian  who had little relevance in the shepard version . moreover  in the complete version  the film begins in the new jersey countryside with mary  where she reads and fantasizes about her ideal lover . she  s disappointed by the reality of the advances by farm  chore boy  johnny applebloom  a character completely absent from the shepard version   but after her affair with driscoll  she returns to the country to presumably and eventually become a farmer  s wife .  br    br   regardless of the print   a girl  s folly  is a good little film for      made by one of the top directors of the     s maurice tourneur . in it  tourneur takes plenty of jabs at his own business  including by playing a caricature of himself   the director of the film  within  the  film . the two leads also give quality performances by early screen  acting standards robert warwick  an actor playing a skirt  chasing star  and doris kenyon  as an ingnue aspiring to play an ingnue on the screen .  br    br   self  referential films  which made film  making the focus of the films  were nothing new by now . mack sennett had already parodied this type of film three years prior with  mabel  s dramatic career  . several aspects of this one stand out  though . frances marion  s intertitles are humorous  including illustrations of the actors on a chessboard with a hand directing them   remarkable for     . i especially liked the film  s final title cards where two observers remark on the film  s happy ending  gee but ain  t that romantick   and  the other replies   romance  nuthin   that  s movin  pictures   fellow female screenwriter anita loos made a similar self  referential conclusion to another film from      wild and woolly  . both writers helped change the role of their professions in the business and art .  br    br   some of the photography by tourneur and john van den broek is good  especially concerning the film  making business . the use of mirrors in several scenes is a nice reinforcement of the film  s self  reflexivity . furthermore  the editing is exceptional . the quick crosscutting during the studio scenes is especially salient it serves to punctuate the hectic pace filmmakers work at  especially back then .  ,1
and it falls squarely into the category of  awesomely bad   ie a movie drunk students would rent to get a kick out of . i was at the sci fi movie festival and all i remember is a wave after wave of hysterical laughter as this movie premiered . other critiques will better describe this movie  s fecal nature  and i felt oh  so  bad at the poor guy from the production company who had turned up  obviously to gauge the audience  s reaction . what he got was the sci fi equivalent of a drunken student audience  and after a  serious  anime movie  i think it was  sky blue   the audience was in a sombre mood  and then this movie opened and within seconds everyone in the room was rolling in the isles . i will bullet point the worst parts  br    br   script the funniest  and worst part of this movie  it clunks along a linear and predictable road with the occasional ill  thought  out aside . rubbish  but eminently laughable .  br    br   animation poorly done  and put together  if you can put up with drab backgrounds and gradually skimpier costumes for the heroine  i know i can    then watch out for the montage where she  trasforms  from a swedish peasant girl into lady death     br    br   characters so one  dimensional its painful  there is a brief backstory  with side  splitting lines of dialogue  and little light is shone on the actual motivation behind some of the main characters .  br    br   so  in a nutshell  if you  ve got a captive audience and a few beverages lying around  try and make sure they  re alcoholic to ease the pain   then slip this movie into the dvd and get in a  mystery science theatre      mindset . there is no other motivation to watch this movie other than to laugh at it  and its not meant to be a comedy . do not watch this movie alone . it could possible be even more boring to watch solo than  new world  with colin farrell as you won  t be able to have a laugh at the ridiculousness with a friend or two .  ,0
principally it is the story of two men who were part of the portuguese revolution . it was easy to understand the contest  but usually directors starts from a historical fact to speak about something else  or they shows also the period before or after this fact  here everything happen during that couple of days when the revolution acts . it could also be seen as a kind of documentary . the movie focalize to these two people  showing as normal they were  not like common heroes  because the revolution come from people . although it was made from military army from the title you can understand that they were just  capitaes  as the main characters . nice colors and lights during the whole movie  excellent work for the director being her first movie  she doesn  t fall to the banal way . well shown emotions and passion of people and crowd . the character of maia  main one  is well  made and there is also a good interpretation for stefano accorsi  able to show maia  s limits  this not  being an hero .  ,1
i rented zero day from the local video store last week . i had never heard of the film and i had my reservations about it . just from looking at the box i knew the film was an indie film and therefore the quality was going to be less than a mainstream film .  br    br   i can tell you that after i finished watching zero day i immediately started it from the beginning again . the film was clearly following the basic outline of what happened at columbine high school of april of      but what struck me was how believable the two lead actors were . my first time through watching this film i wasn  t entirely sure if what i was watching were actual tapes left behind by the shooters at columbine . in the back of my mind i knew what i was watching could not be real but at the same time the acting was so convincing you had to keep giving your head a shake .  br    br   is the film disturbing  absolutely  are you going to see things that will make you question the merit of the film  probably . i think what most people will find disturbing is they will actually have feelings for the two lead characters  calvin and andre  played by cal robertson and andre keuck  . why is that problematic for some people  calvin and andre are planning a massacre at their high school . i know for myself  i felt an immense sadness for andre and calvin . i had empathy for them because their lives had come to such a horrific point . they had fallen so deeply through cracks that they had begun a journey down a road which could have been stopped  if only people around them had taken notice to their plight .  br    br   zero day is a phenomenal film . it gives you an up close and personal look to events that most of us will only ever see the conclusion to on the news . it leaves you thinking about the lives involved . and it leaves you perplexed how people get to this point . a week after seeing this film  i still think about it .  br    br   those of you who have not seen zero day please keep in mind the following the film is an independent with little to no budget and the film is shot on camcorders . the material in the film is disturbing . this is not mainstream hollywood and there is no happy ending .  br    br   but if you can put all that aside  zero day is a film that will stick with you and just maybe help you to open your eyes a little .  ,1
  a classic is something that everybody wants to have read but nobody wants to read . a classic is also something that everyone praises but no one has read .   mark twain  br    br    classic  seems to be the word used to describe  scarface   brian depalma  s     film about opulence  self surrender  greed  and danger among florida  s drug ring . people and critics  and rappers for that matter  deem this film  an epic gangster classic  or  eptiome of gangster films .  when it is anything but . it is praised for all the wrong reasons . scarface is a terrific film that deserves praise from all over  but not all the praise it gets from audiences today  and therefor the fine points it so poignantly makes are missed by the general public .  br    br   first off  the film is about a cuban refugee  with a past of wanting to escape communism grasp and find happiness . simple  yes . but the layers of de palma  s directing genius  and the great story written by oliver stone  yes i know  he actually wrote a real good one here  play into all of it . the characters are all looking for an escape  as escape is a natural element dealt with in the film by all . each character has something to offer  that makes them likable by everyone who could appreciate this film . they are entwined in a world of mystique and money  but all that has a price  as they all learn . each character thinks they are getting better chances in life  when in true dramatic irony  they are actually getting worse .  tragedy  would be a better word to describe this movie . all those who praise the film for it  s drug usage  it  s violence  it  s dialog  totally missed the point . there is nothing really positive about the film besides the characters positive expectations of themselves . and that is why the film works so well . the devastation through out the film serves to deliver the message of the film  not to look cool or attract viewers . brian de palma doesn  t make movies for cult gangsters  or brainless action fans .  br    br   next on  the film is an adult drama . it is not a  gangster film  . it has it  s share of action  but the action is plotted very carefully  so it has a point . it  s not like  aliens   an example of a big dumb action film  and most audiences perceive this film as a big dumb action gangster film about doing drugs and shooting people . ridiculous . hogwash . if this film is about that  then it is about how bad it is . not a promotion of it .  br    br   this being said  the film is indeed a great film . it has great cinematography that pulls you into the story . it has a very dramatic score  in true giorgio moroder style   which simply could give you chills  or bring you to tears . the film is rather lengthy  but it is a story  and each moment counts . the acting is terrific . al pacino  enough said . he can do any role that he puts his mind to  and this was no exception . pretty boy steven bauer  as manny . i didn  t think much of him in other films he did  but he actually makes you like him when he goes under maestro de palma  s direction . michelle pfeiffer is a true gem as elvira . popping  fresh off the heels of a sort of embarrassment in  grease   she got her ticket to ride performing a no holds barred performance of a beauty that is more than meets the eye . but the three true diamonds in this rough are mary elizabeth mastrontonio as tony  s sister gina  who when she smiles  or cries  we see her soul and her fresh way of living  and watch it deteriorate paul shenar as alejandro sosa  a drug lord  who runs deeper than a river  and shenar portrays him as so and miriam colom as tony and gina  s torn mother . these three dig the film as deep as it can go .  br    br   this reviewer learned one main thing when watching  scarface  for the first time . always go into a film unsuspecting . all the hype and talk of this film cannot possibly prepare you for what you really see . only knowing de palma  like i do  can give you even a glimpse of what this film holds . so ignore the rap crap  ignore the mindless violence supporters  and fix yourself a glass of bailey  s on the rocks  and indulge yourself in an emotional viewing of a great film  the real  scarface .   ,1
wow . . . speechless as to the making of this film  i can  t say much . the coverbox at the local videostore should  ve said it all . . . nothing but  actors  actresses who get lost on the set of scream and decide to shoot a movie   br    br   the acting was apparently not in the budget  but they were able to afford nudity and good  looking actors  style over substance almost makes its mark here  except most of these acting  class failures keep forgetting that there is a plot that needs to go somewhere when they were reading this script . after only  or  kills by the so  called masked murderer and a confusing tie  in plot about a murder club which the dumb lead actress thinks is a real club that she can join  only if she can get over a girl bumping into her car   you want to stab your hands with the nearest sharp object to remind yourself never to get overly excited by a possibly good movie such as this .  br    br   i feel bad for the people who bought this film and can  t find anyone to take it off their hands . another example of what  s wrong with the growing number of straight to video horror releases with no thought put into the essentials . throw it away if you did buy this .  ,0
stephen feinberg  who played the proctologist and was one of the writers of the movie  passed away in early     . i met steve in portland in      it was a year latter when he told me that he had been a writer in hollywood years earlier  working mostly on tv promos . he asked me not to see  tunnel vision   but it was too late  i had seen it already  actually i had seen it years before  when it was released . at that time i didn  t think it was that bad a movie . however seeing it as an adult my opinion was somewhat different . yes is is a bit puerile as well as dated . steve admitted it was not a very good movie . that said he was just a little proud of  the proctologist  sketch .  ,0
this movie made me very happy . it  s impossible not to love the smart and sweet orphan girl who changes the heart of a selfish lawyer only interested in pursuing success in her career . this is a very optimistic movie and i sincerely believe that we need more films like curly sue . it touched my heart .  ,1
how much could the general hollywood director learn from this movie  all . . . when it comes to actually scaring people . this movies truly shows that it is possible to really frighten and scare a viewer  and that monstrous monsters and long knifes never will be the best way of achieving this . all who love a real psychological thriller must see this movie . . . it is the best of it  s kind .  ,1
buddy is an entertaining family film set in a time when  humanizing  animals  and making them cute was an accepted way to get people to be interested in them .  br    br   based on a true story  buddy shows the great love that the main characters have for animals and for each other  and that they will do anything for each other .  br    br   while not a perfect movie  the animated gorilla is quite lifelike most of the time and the mayhem that occurs within the home is usually amusing for children .  br    br   this film misses an opportunity to address the mistake of bringing wild animals into the home as pets  but does show the difficulties .  br    br   a recommended film which was the first for jim henson productions .  ,1
i was prepared for a turgid talky soap opera cum travelogue  but was pleased to find a fast  paced script  an underlying moral  excellent portrayals from all the actors  especially peter finch  amazing special effects  suspense  and beautiful cinematography   there  s even a shot of the majestic stone buddhas recently destroyed by the taliban . not to mention elizabeth taylor at her most gloriously beautiful and sympathetic  before she gave in to the gaspy hysterics that marred her later work . all the supporting players round it out  and i do wonder who trained all those elephants .  br    br   speaking of the stone  buddha sequence  you really can discern that it  s vivien leigh in the long shots . her shape and the way she moves is distinct from taylor  s . the only thing marring that sequence are the poorly done process shots  where the background moves by much too fast for horses at a walk .  br    br   if you want a thought  provoking film that is beautiful to watch and never boring  spend a few hours with elephant walk .  ,1
as i watched this movie  and i began to see its  characters develop i could feel this would be an excellent picture . when you get that feeling  and the movie indeed fills those expectations the experience is rare . i had that very feeling throughout this movie . robert deniro and cuba gooding junior played riveting and amazingly strong parts which were both oscar worthy . the supporting cast was equally as strong creating a winning foundation for the picture to grow on . i can say without any hesitation at all  see this movie it will not disappoint .  ,1
don  t understand how these animated movies keep coming out  and no matter how good  or bad  it is people love it .  br    br   i saw this movie with my two kids      . they like pretty much anything animated  like most people who rated this film  . the theater was almost full  and i looked forward to seeing the movie with its superb cast . to tell the truth i was bored silly . it was unbelievably predictable and just plain unfunny . there were a couple chuckles throughout the film and that was it . of course they tried time and time again to get the cheap laugh  but just didn  t work . my son almost always says to me that he wants the dvd after we see an animated movie  but not on this one . my daughter fell asleep half way through . also  the kids thought the character animation looked weird . i haven  t heard that from them since seeing the polar express  which gave my daughter nightmares .  br    br   trust me  i  m not the type who looks for the negative in everything . but quality is quality  and like so many animated movies they throw out there  it has very little .  ,0
i  ve now just realised that by watching this film i have lost valuable precious moments of my life i will never get back . thsi film isn  t just poor its dire . it reminded me of every stereotypical black sitcom ever made .  br    br   i regret watching this film .  br    br   flixmedia reckons its a race issue  apparently  white  people don  t like it because it doesn  t have white actors . mate  i think you  ll find the reason why no one liked this was because watching paint dry is far more entertaining and funnier then this pile of drivel .  br    br   please stop making crap films  ,0
  fraidy cat   the  th of these cartoons  is a good one . at least i like it  so i  m surprised that this is getting mixed reviews .  br    br   this one is more of a macabre story than a funny one  although it has its moments of comedy . the atmosphere is dark and spooky . suspense is another strong element here . as for humor  it  s mostly dark humor .  br    br   in this short  tom listens to a creepy radio show at night and is absolutely terrified because it is about ghosts  something he believes . while tom is scared to death  jerry is watching everything and can  t help but laugh the whole time . in fact  jerry quickly finds a way to torture him more and more . with the help of a white shirt and a vacuum cleaner he creates a big  ghost  .  br    br   tom lives the scariest experience of his whole life . although jerry scares tom without a good reason  the way the story is made ends up being funny . plus  once again  there is no violence here because this is one of tom  jerry  s oldest cartoons . however  i don  t get that joke of tom  s  lives nearly sucked into the vacuum cleaner .  br    br   when tom finally finds out that it was all a jerry  s scheme and that jerry made a fool out of him  jerry is caught with the hand in the cookie jar  he deserves to be discovered  . yet  tom shows an incredible patience before reacting . he angrily looks at jerry for about a minute . the funny thing is that jerry invites tom to laugh with him and takes about half a minute to realize that tom is looking at him with a very serious face . jerry tries to be funny  but tom doesn  t laugh .  br    br   overall  this is a different  peculiar and remarkable tom  jerry experience .  ,1
seriously  what is this  hooper has made such classic films like texas chainsaw massacre  then he made this god awful film  what happened  did he dip into the crack a little too much  this film is about some dude named sam who has the ability to set things on fire   firestarter  anyone   the acting was godawful  the plot was rubbish  and the special effects were extremely rubbish  they looked like something from the    s . van damme should be pleased that derailed is no longer the worst film ever  and what was with the ending  he started glowing blue  turned into a glowing blue blob  sucked out his girlfriends fire  and the film ended . what was that  huh  when the film ended i hoped the dvd would spontaniously combust to save me from my pain .  br    br   stay away from this film .  br    br   don  t think  obey  you  ll thank me later .  ,0
a really bad sequel . part  had a lot of funny moments  part  is just bad  in a boring way  and obviously made to squeeze money out of the fans .  br    br   shame on you  otto waalkes   br    br   the only slightly amusing moment in the film is helge schneider who apparently seems to be pised about the other characters . it  s quite easy to identify with him . . .  br    br   the screenplay is sloppy  non  existent . the director should do everyone a favor and quit his job immediately . the acting is worse than a  nd grade school play .  br    br   technically the movie is awful as well  but who can blame the cinematographer  sound guys who had to work with such an untalented director   ,0
from actor and independent writer  director john cassavetes  a woman under the influence gives the viewer a look at a working class family with a problem of mental instability . the husband  nick  played by peter falk  is a blue collar worker who has trouble showing his wife  mabel  played by gena rowlands  the amount of attention that she deserves . from the onset of the film  it is obvious that mabel is very quirky and strange  but only a few minutes later it is clear that she is much more than that . crazy . bonkers . out of her damn mind . nick tries his hardest to hide this from his co  workers  and after she has a particularly strange incident at dinner  he asks her if she  ll be okay  as if he  s trying to deny mabel  s illness . her problem only spirals from there .  br    br   i did find some particular problems with this film . i guess these problems were mostly present in the story  and the way some of the character acted toward the end . mabel has been committed  because  frankly  she  s nuts . then  six months later  she  s ready to come out of the hospital  and her husband throws a party to welcome her back . he never acts stupid in the beginning of the movie . why would he invite all these people  some of them strangers to mabel  over to his house when his wife is in such a fragile state  it  s simply idiotic . later  after mabel comes in the house  mabel  s father has a huge outburst at nick  screaming at the top of his lungs about not wanting to eat spaghetti . his daughter has just gotten back from six months of rehabilitation  and the thing you want to do is keep her calm  and he goes nuts over spaghetti  a few minutes later in the film  nick brings mabel into the stairwell and forces her to do the things she did when she was mentally unstable make her weird noises and gestures . didn  t he send her there to make her better and not do those things  there were various other parts that occurred after this  but it would just be redundant to look at them in more detail . i guess i just had a serious problem with the decision by cassavetes to have his characters act in this way . it simply didn  t make sense .  br    br   however  although i had problems with the ending of the film  there was one aspect that really redeemed it the acting . gena rowlands played an amazing crazy woman . there were times when i forgot she was acting  where i got so caught up in her wild gesticulations and crazy talk that i was actually scared of her . she was amazingly convincing and intense . however  i was also impressed by the rest of mabel  s family . peter falk played a very strange character  and i almost thought he was crazy himself  because of the awkward way he handled his children  his job  and especially the situation with his wife . i also usually don  t appreciate child actors . but the young people who played nick and mabel  s children in this film were phenomenal . it really felt like they were mabel  s children  because they seemed so attached to her and were so interesting in helping her with her problem . i think their performances are one of the things that kept this film together  and without them it would have made the film less realistic and less intense .  br    br   in general i wasn  t impressed by this film . the story was jumbled and unclear  and the characters acted in ways that made me wonder who wasn  t insane in the movie . the only saving grace were brilliant lead acting roles of the longhetti family . their realistic dialogue and powerful acting kept the film together  and are probably the only reason the film has ever amounted to anything .  ,0
it  s a great american martial arts movie . the fighting scenes were pretty impressive for american movie made in    s . of course the fighting scenes aren  t that good as in honk kong movies  actually only few american movies have fighting scenes which are as good as in honk kong movies  even nowadays . when you watch american martial arts movie  you are expecting to see less impressive fighting scenes  but still having some nice moves  which can be surprisingly good sometimes  or at least that  s what i  m expecting from these movies . i was impressed by this film . some fighting scenes were really impressive  the acting  direction and the plot were good enough  so it  s a really worth watching movie  if you like american martial arts films of the    s .  ,1
born again is a sub  standard episode from season one . it deals with the subject of reincarnation and just doesn  t fly . i  ve never been big on reincarnation and that could be part of my apathy toward this episode . it does reference the tooms case which is some nice continuation from the previous episode . but the positives end there . which is unfortunate because that takes place at the beginning of the episode . i think it  s ludicrous that a dead guy would chose to reincarnate in the body of a completely unrelated girl . and he waits until the girl turns eight to start exacting revenge . there  s even a serious lack of witty mulder  scully dialogue to keep the episode afloat . if you  re into reincarnation  maybe this episode is up your alley . if you  re not  then at least you can learn what bradycardia is .  ,0
i saw this movie twice . i can  t believe pintilie made such a fantasy movie . i  m also a movie  theatre director and i know what i speak . this is not romania anymore  but i see the events are happening in the same period with the incident from   september . no story  no plot  nothing . no conclusion  no message  nothing profound  nothing hidden . just empty images .  br    br   what most of romanians don  t know  this movie is for the french viewers  not for us . they really believe that is the reality in romania . also for teenagers . pintilie should stop making movies . i don  t really know if we can call this a movie  maybe a horror   and we wonder why we  ve got such an image in europe . this was a reality  but isn  t anymore . a good friend of mine from the brithish embassy said  you have no idea what a long way romanian people walked from ceausescu  .  ,0
superb movie . very good photography of        bolton  which seems now to be a different world . thoughtful and an excellent dramatisation and production . james mason a real first class star . it is and i would agree with the above comment that this movie is a national treasure .  ,1
i saw this movie when i was in israel for the summer . my hebrew is not fluent  so the subtitles were very useful  i didn  t feel lost at any point in the movie . you tend to get used to subtitles after about  minutes .  br    br   this movie blew me away       it depicts two of the most prominent taboos in the middle east today a homosexual relationship between an israeli and a palestinian . it allows a person to enter both realms of the conflict simultaneously . the dilemma  the emotions entailed . the movie climaxes in tragedy when anger and rage drive one of the lovers to one extremist side  an absolute must see    ,1
  telefilms  tend to fall under the pitfalls of a low budget and a hasty shooting schedule  which is why this film always tends to buck the trend .  br    br   george c . scott embodies ebenezer scrooge perfectly  fully encompassing all of his cold tendencies  and still makes him a simpathetic character . the production value for this film was exceptional  never relying on boffo special effects or soundstage set  ups  yet relying on the depth and clarity of on  site shooting and strong backdrops . a movie that certainly stands alone .  ,1
a good cast  with one major exception  pushes its way through epstein  s smart light satire . mansfield was never better  or funnier  than she is here paired with walston  who  s a veteran who  s determined to become a congressman to get out of the war . he and his buddies   including suave con  artist grant   head to san francisco on leave and start the city  s swinginest party while conniving to escape the service altogether through industrial speaking tours . the only thing about this movie that  s not delightful is suzy parker  s one  note performance as grant  s love interest  which takes up too much of the film  s time and slows down the pace in the second half . walston and mansfield have good chemistry the gimmick is that she  s set on making love to every serviceman  to do her duty for the war effort  of course  but he  s a married man who  nonetheless  loves his wife . they steal the movie with little trouble from grant  who  s amusing here in the first part of the film  when not paired with his non  actor co  star .  ,0
i was about thirteen when this movie came out on television . it is far superior in action than most movies since . martin sheen is excellent  and though nick nolte has a small part  he too provides excellent support . vic morrow as the villain is superb .  br    br   when sheen  tests the water  in his    ford  cool  along the mountainous highway it is spectacular   br    br   the ending is grand .  br    br   i  m disappointed in the low vote this received . i figure the younger generations have more interest in much of the junk that is coming out these days .  br    br   good taste eludes the masses   ,1
don  t bother . a little prosciutto could go a long way  but all we get is pure ham  particularly from dunaway . the plot is one of those bumper car episodes . . . the vehicle bounces into another and everything changes direction again  until we are merely scratching our heads wondering if there were ever a plot . gina phillips is actually good  but it  s hard playing across from a mystified dunaway playing lady macbeth lost in the marx  s brother  s duck soup . ah  the raven . . . now there  s an actor . and there is the relative who just lies and bed and looks ghostly . or dr . dread who  s filled with lots of gloom and no working remedies . i  m one of those suckers who just has to see a movie to the end . quoth the raven   nevermore .   ,0
alright  i got passed the horrible acting . i got passed the fact that lil kim was blasting some cannons and her arms or hands weren  t moving  i got passed the weaves  i got passed the colored contacts .  br    br   this is what killed it for me in the scene where the four roses were sitting at the table arguing . lisa  raye and monica calhoun stand up and  and then lil kim gets up to break up any hostilities by saying   whoa  whoa  whoa  hold up . let  s chill out here for a hot second .  i am a fan of the western movie genre  and i never heard anyone talk slang like this in any of clint eastwood  s movies .  br    br   if anyone thinks this movie deserves over a  rating  please tell me another movie that  s worse than gang of roses .  br    br   i  m through .  ,0
in what must be one of the most blood  freezing movies ever  a transvestite is murdering people in new york  and the answer to everything may not be what people suspect . one can see how brian depalma takes some influence from hitchcock with camera angles and stuff . michael caine plays a most thought  provoking character  while angie dickinson is basically a bored rich woman with a bad hairdo . keith gordon  who later starred in  christine   is probably the most interesting character in the movie . but you can  t really understand this movie without seeing it . and after seeing it  you may never know just whom you can trust . also starring nancy allen and dennis franz .  ,1
dude  really     where have you guys been the past   years  this is shocking in all kind of ways  horror  this is a joke  there is nothing wrong with being low budget  but this is a laugh  if you want to look at the classics  freaks of tod browning  the victims of dracula and frankenstein  the undying monster  ernest thesiger  paul wegener  s the golem and the passengers of the ghost train  you can  t compare it  it gives it a bad name  bad acting  bad screenplay etc . total waist of money and free time  have watched a lot of movies  were as horror is my all time favorite  i really am speechless  have nothing more to say that please don  t do the effort to watch something so daft  please understand  ,0
the cast was good  and i thought it was a good performance from christopher lloyd  whom i like from previous movies . the movie was a great family movie  nothing that would make you worry to show it to younger kids  a good story line  lots of laughs  lighthearted and enjoyable . if you want to entertain children without being bored to tears this fits the bill . kid pleasing  and not difficult for a parent to watch  either .  ,1
this is a film that on the surface would seem to be all about j . edgar hoover giving himself a a big pat on the back for fighting klansmen  going after indian killers  hunting the famous gangsters of the      s  fighting nazi  s in the us and south america during world war  and commies in new york during the early      s . of course in     we did not know about mr . hoover  s obsession for keeping secret files on honest americans  bugging people like the rev . martin luther king  jr  but worst of all  his secret love affair with his deputy director  clyde tolson  if you want to know more about that subject  i suggest seeing the film citizen cohn  . hoover aside  this story of a life in the fbi as told by jimmy stewart makes for a decent  but dated film . vera miles as his devoted wife is also good . but jimmy is the movie . as much as hoover controlled production and always made sure the fbi was seen without fault  jimmy stewart gave the film a human side  quite an achievement considering hoover was always looking over his shoulder . the background score is also pleasant . i have read recent online articles suggesting that this is a forgotten film . jimmy stewart was one of the greatest film stars of all time and none of his films should be forgotten . tcm was the last network to show it a long time ago and i hope they show it again .  ,1
just read the original story which is written by pu in   th century . strikingly  the movie despict the original spirit very well  though the plot was modified tremendously . the film language  the rhythm  the special effect are all from hollywood  but still there is a chinese core . it is amazing how hark tsui managed to combine them together . the result is pure beauty .  ,1
disney have done it again . brilliant the way timone and pumbaa are brought back to life yet again to tell us how they came to meet and help simba when he needed them . i love this film and watch it over and over again . it shows how timone lived with his family and fellow meerkats before setting off to find his dream home and adventure . then he meets pumbaa and things do change . together  they search for the home timon wants and repeatedly fail  which is funny as timone gets more and more crazy . then simba turns up and we see more of his childhood than we did in the previous  films . the rest  you already know .  ,1
i  m not alone in admiring the first superman movie  a film that richard donner executed masterfully . i am also not alone in scorning richard lester  s superman  . . . which brings us to the richard donner cut of the same movie  sadly it is still an absolute abomination .  br    br   superman  s world is one where suspension of disbelief is required in strong doses  but superman  stretches things too far . it doesn  t matter who directed superman  because the script insults the intelligence of a first grader . in a sense there is no plot because the characters have zero motivation to act the way they do  unlike the original superman . with or without his powers  superman  s strength  or lack thereof  is handled in the least believable manner . there is too much to criticize  so i will not bother . i condemn this movie . . . perhaps the slapstick in the lester version is more appropriate to the moronic script this movie is based on . super  duper bad .  ,0
if you want a serious laugh pain  watch this movie  and the things bruce inflicts on his fellow newscaster . the deleted scenes are priceless . i don  t know why they didn  t include them in the original movie . it can  t be because of time  since the movie is only    minutes long . morgan freeman is a brilliant actor  who has been overlooked for too long . jim carrey needs meds   ,1
if you haven  t seen zombie bloodbath  you haven  t . a contest like  make your own horror movie in one day  could not possibly come up with a entry than this outrage of an insult on any viewer  s intelligence . mr . sheets forgot a story  a plot  proper dialog  the fact that people need some basic acting talents and the credited lighting designer obviously forgot to show up . it seems to be recorded on the crummiest of handycams  and copied on even worse equipment . make  up effect consist of black mascara for the zombies and yoghurt being poured over people  s heads in order to simulate their skin melting . this is nothing more than a home  movie  and a really bad one as well . only fun to watch for the friends  familymembers and neighbours that were willing to show up for the filming . i cannot for the life of me understand why this mockery of a product is listed in any serious film magazine or website  i have home  movies of wedding parties that are way better and more interesting . a total waste of time  money and energy . the sequel zombie bloodbath ii is just more of the same rubbish .  ,0
a typical lanza flick that had limited audience appeal with a weak story line that was put together simply to justify lanza  s mgm contract at the time .  br    br   as reported by member lastliberal  above  grayson could not stand lanza because of his obscene advances towards her off  and sometimes on  camera . in addition  his gutter mannerism and the continual smell of alcohol in her face during scenes they did together were intolerable . after doing their second  and last  film together   toast of new orleans   the normally quiet grayson stormed into louie b . mayer  s office and told him in no uncertain words that she would never work with lanza again  period . mayer felt that grayson was much more valuable to mgm then lanza  so grayson  s statement stuck . grayson went on to star in a number of widely received  and far more profitable  musicals with howard keel and others . later in life when asked to compare lanza and keel her reply was that there was no comparison between them  and that keel was great to work with and had much more appeal to the  real people  in the audiences .  ,0
christ . a sequel to one of the most cloying films of all time  this at least has the decency to leave out the songs  bar a reprise of the unbearable  tomorrow   but does continue the tradition of being nauseating and unfunny . this time  annie and her friends head off to london and get caught up in joan collins  s plot to blow up buckingham palace or some such shite . the movie has a bizarrely sycophantic attitude towards its eponymous character at odds with how irritating she is every time the little bugger squeals  leapin  lizards   i could feel my teeth grinding themselves down into powder . drearily photographed  slushy and plodding  the movie has only one memorable line   unhand me  you stupid genius    and the fact that it  s not the original to recommend it .  ,0
this movie  no correction  this thing  this abysmal abomination from the burning pits of hell should have been killed before it even left the writer  s head . i could not possibly come up with enough adjectives to describe this movie . but let  s try anyway . horrible  bad  nauseating  tasteless  crap  vomit inducing  gut wrenchingly bad  hideous  nasty  putrid  there just aren  t enough words in the english language  the  plot  involves a serial killer who becomes a snow man . don  t ask how  not important . the killer snowman runs about killing people . how  you may ask  can a snowman kill someone  in tasteless ways that make you want to remove your eyes if only so you don  t have to endure that styrofoam snowman anymore . in ways that make you want to fill your ears with hot wax so you do not have to endure his snow puns anymore . don  t watch this movie  destroy it on sight  for the sake of your very soul don  t watch it   ,0
its taken a few viewings for me to really wrap myself around this one  but for me tears of kali is one of the horror highlights of the    s and as far as independent horror goes a veritable masterpiece . an anthology horror  it takes on the story of the fictional taylor  eriksson group  a cult of sorts based in india whose members set out in search of ultimate self knowledge and healing of the psyche  with unpleasant results that echo down the years . with bookend segments set in india the film is made chiefly of three stories set in germany  illustrating the aftermath of the work of the taylor  eriksson group  with some pretty nasty gore at times . its an interesting set up as these things go  but what sets this film apart is the way the imagery is so carefully set up to develop the films horror . bad things have been unleashed and the general course of the film is a look at how the quest for self knowledge and ultimate therapy brings horror to patients  healers and others and the film is loaded with smart visual clues to the power of the dark forces with which it deals  dark forces unbound by time  place or even personality . good examples of this are found in the first story especially  dealing with a journalist interviewing a lady in a mental hospital . previous to this story we have seen lars eriksson and notably his wonky  lazy   eye  we also see him healing or at least comforting a patient . the lady mental patient of the first story is seen in the same stance as eriksson healing a fellow patient  also as she wraps up the canvases from the art class that she runs among her fellow patients one of their pictures is seen  a face with lazy eye like erikssons . there are also references to folk in minuscule roles  extras and walk ons having extra sensory perceptions of what is going on in the film  showing the badness that has been unleashed spreading and able to almost infect others . there is more to the film philosophically than just evil within  it is a film about death  suffering and possible redemption too all bound in a structure derived from hindu beliefs in a fashion that seems like it might just be exploitation but has more relation to actual beliefs than one might expect  at least from the research that i did on wikipedia  . writer  director andreas marschall definitely deserves some significant credit for his skill in constructing the film . as well as being thoughtful  the film is pretty chilling too  the soundtrack of bharti india and panama john has a great eerie piano jingle and there are a couple of notable performances  michael balaun as a sinister doctor and cora chilcot as a freaky patient especially good . the third story also has a fine turn from veteran mathieu carrire as a faith healer . the biggest problem of the film is that it is not that involving a lot of the time so potential for fear is lost but these and a couple of other performances achieve involvement pretty well . so  the film isn  t quite as gripping as it might be  the acting occasionally off and the pacing too  but mostly i thought it was pretty great  if a shade short of its possible brilliance . well worth a look for adventurous horror fans i think .  ,1
i just saw  valentine  and i have to say that it was the best slasher movie that i  ve seen in years . unlike the recent trend of    s horror flicks  this movie is more concerned with being eerie than it is with being self  mocking . for those out there that hated  scream   there is not one reference to  the horror rules  in this movie  even though the old slasher movie rules do apply here  .  br    br   this is the perfect blend of    s and    s horror . you get the style  cinematography  and good acting of    s films and the stalking  slasher madness of an    s flick . i guess the year     is going to finally give horror fans the kind of movies they were longing for . this is definitely a move in the right direction .  br    br   denise richards stands out here as a fun character . you can tell she liked her role  and that makes her stand out . i loved her in this movie .  ,1
this was the best bonnie and clyde movie i have seen . it has more accurate accounts of what happened and while it doesnt glorify their crimes it casts the pair in a normal light . i give this movie a   . it has great actors  realistic scenes and excellent writers .  ,1
the worst kind of film . basically  the us declaration of independence was replaced with a plasma screen and this fooled the museum  s security for several days . eh   br    br   the plasma screen that would theoretically run for less than  seconds off that watch battery  assuming it had a low enough internal resistance to deliver the required current  which it wouldn  t .  br    br   it would be possible with a dozen large car batteries and an inverter  but that system wouldn  t fit into the case . sorry to be anal  but this isn  t even close to being plausible . the rest of the film wasn  t a great deal better and i  m left wondering why the budget couldn  t have been donated to charity or me .  ,0
a real blow  up of the film literally . this british film is boringly made .  br    br   what an exciting plot  a terrorist places bombs on a train . how could the writers and producers of this stinker turn this into such a dull story   br    br   glenn ford  as the expert called upon to defuse the bomb  is given awful writing material to work with . naturally  just as he is called in  his wife  anne vernon  is about to leave him . no wonder we never heard of miss vernon . after such a film  it would be enough to end her career .  br    br   that elderly man who loved trains and interferes is our     version of senile dementia . i thought it was highly insulting to show this man  even at the end .  ,0
yep  lots of shouting  screaming  cheering  arguing  celebrating  fist clinching  high fiving  fighting . you have a general idea as to why  but can never be     certain . a naval knowledge would be an advantage for the finer points  but then you  d probably spot the many flaws . not an awful film  hackman  washington are their usual brilliant  but the plot was one you could peg pretty early on . i  m still waiting to see a submarine film where people get on with each other  don  t argue  but then you probably wouldn  t have a film .  br    br        ,0
rumors is a memorable entry in the wartime series of instructional cartoons starring  private snafu .  the films were aimed at servicemen and were directed  animated and scored by some of the top talent from warner bros .  termite terrace  including friz freleng  chuck jones  and carl stalling . the invaluable mel blanc supplied the voice for snafu  and the stories and rhyming narration for many of the films was supplied by theodor geisel  i . e . dr . seuss . the idea was to convey basic concepts with humor and vivid imagery  using the character of snafu as a perfect negative example he was the dope  the little twerp who would do everything you  re not supposed to do . according to chuck jones the scripts had to be approved by pentagon officials  but army brass also permitted the animators an unusual amount of freedom concerning language and bawdy jokes  certainly more than theatrical censorship of the time would allow   all for the greater good  of course .  br    br   as the title would indicate  this cartoon is an illustration of the damaging power of rumors . the setting is an army camp . private snafu sits next to another soldier in the latrine  something you won  t see in any other hollywood films of the era  and their casual conversation starts the ball rolling . we observe as an offhand remark about a bombing is misinterpreted  then exaggerated  then turned into an increasingly frightening rumor that sweeps the camp . the imagery is indeed vivid the brain of one anxious soldier is depicted as a percolating pot  while the fevered speech of another is rendered as steamy hot air  i . e  balloon juice .  a soldier  shoots his mouth off   cannon  style  and before you know it actual baloney is flying in every direction . winged baloney  at that . panicked soldiers tell each other that the brooklyn bridge has been pulverized  coney island wiped out  enemy troops have landed on the white house lawn  and the japanese are in california . the visuals become ever more surreal and nightmarish until at last the camp is quarantined for  rumor  itis  and private snafu has been locked up in a padded cell .  br    br   this is a highly effective piece of work . the filmmakers dramatized their theme with wit and startling energy  and the message is still a valid one . in recent years we  ve seen that catastrophic events  real or imagined  can breed all kinds of wild rumors that spread more rapidly than ever thanks to communication advances . because the technology has improved  the private snafus of our time are able to broadcast their own balloon juice via e  mail  cellphones and blogging . consequently  rumors is a rare example of a wartime educational film whose essential message doesn  t feel at all dated in fact it may be more timely than ever .  ,1
it  s a rather good movie  but too americanised in it  s predictability . change the kung fu for football and the turkish family for a pakistani one  and you get to watch bend it like beckham       almost scene for scene . a nice feature the serves as the backbone of the movie is the progression of fights with the mysterious ninja under the highway  beginning with miserable losses and slowly progressing until the last fight is a win against oneself  as the kung fu master stressed several times . on a different level  the danish life is revealed quite different than the image it has by outsiders the non indigenous immigrants that make a large proportion  actually  the majority  of the danish citizenry  the graffiti in the copenhagen suburbs  the taunting of the immigrant girl in the begging of the movie . all portray a different picture than one has in mind when one hears the word denmark .  ,1
certainly not horrible  but definitely not good .  br    br   cry  the beloved country       was directed by darrell roodt and written for the screen by ronald harwood  adapted from the     novel by alan paton  . starring james earl jones and richard harris .  br    br   the film is about pre  apartheid south africa  and the stories of a black man and a white man intertwining . the pious but naive preacher stephen kumalo  james earl jones  receives a letter from johannesburg saying that he must come immediately he later finds that his son has killed a man . the rich farmer  landowner james jarvis  richard harris  finds that his son  a fighter for black rights  was the one killed by kumalo  s son . in this they connect .  br    br   i cannot compare it to the     film of the same name  for i have not seen it . or the     musical titled lost in the stars for i have also not seen it both look better than this one . but cry freedom  on the other hand  i have seen it has a much more urgent air to it  like it actually is trying to say something where the film cry  the beloved country seems to have no idea where it is going . very  wishy  washy  . i refuse to compare the film to the novel  except that i did enjoy the novel more than i enjoyed the film  because novels and films are two extremely different media and there is no point in trying to transfer directly one to the other or compare them via the same means .  br    br   frankly  this movie blew . well  i guess it wasn  t that bad    five  out  of  ten    but it wasn  t that good either . both of the leads  both very capable actors pull some of the most wooden performances i have seen with some of the most awkward dialogue in film history  but that can be blamed on he screenwriter  ronald harwood  who is also oddly off is game with this film  having also written the sublime the pianist  and being julia  . among other things the point and themes of the novel are lost almost entirely in its transition to film for the third time there is little  if any  tension with any moment of the film  racially or suspensefully . the music doesn  t help . the painfully misplaced and boringly pastoral orchestra tracks really help with this dulling down of the film . one upside is the cinematography  with many rather good or great shots  but unfortunately  this does not help the film too much .  br    br   the last  striking words of alan paton  s novel are displayed in the last moments of the film . it is too bad that they seem to be so disconnected from the film that was just shown . i don  t know what nelson mandela might have seen in this film .  br    br   thanks for your time .  ,0

ever wonder why pacific islanders seem to automatically assume the sense of humour of black americans  regardless of their ethnic origins  well this film will not provide any answers to this often pondered question  but it will provide an excellent case study .  br    br   from its onset this film acts as a sort of  old school  for pacific island new zealanders  which immediately raises the question what exactly is the point of such a task . is it meant to perpetuate ingrained stereotypes of pacific island new zealanders  or is it intended to exploit this potential market  the story is weak  jokes humorless  and the ending is expected . this film has done nothing for new zealand cinema  as it is merely an appropriated romantic comedy that is devoid of any merit .  ,0
okay . yes  this was a very  tight  budget movie with continuity errors  like single scenes obviously filmed in sunshine and then in shadow and then mixed together   and as much as i love nick mancuso he was often a little too good at the burnt  out part  and some of the minor supporting cast was really bad  plus at least one actor was used for two different but conspicuous roles  . but come on . richard grieco was hysterical  his hair alone is worth the trip  . steven ford was very likable . mancuso had some great lines  while nancy allen  ironically  was completely bland and uninteresting . classic  no . bad parts  yes . entertaining  big yes . i would have loved to have been on  set the day they decided what kind of hairstyle grieco would have .  are you fast   . . .  y  ain  t that fast .   ,1
what an awful movie  the idea of robots fighting each other is cool  but the storyline is ridiculous  real human action laughable  acting non  existent and special effects  on which  this type of movie must depend  are archaic . i thought it must have been made around        and was amazed to see it was from     . that  s  years after aliens  ok  lots of people said it was good considering the low budget  but i just think  what  s the point   . it looks totally unbelievable . i wouldn  t mind seeing a remake with modern special effects and a completely re  written story because i still like the idea of huge robots beating crap out of each other .  ,0
this is only related to the first movie by the name . the plot has nothing to do with the first and the whole movie stinks    i have no idea what they were thinking but this movie is so bad . avoid this at all costs  the first movie in the series is acceptable as a slasher flick and so is the fourth but this one and the  rd are rubbish    ,0

one of the things that makes this ealing comedy so outrageously funny is the clever editing . shots that would be considered absolutely essential to most modern comedies are deliberately left out .  this is what was known as british understatement .   br    br   three instances a comic fight is edited like this . alec guiness has invented a new cloth that will ruin the industry . half a dozen businessmen invite him to their office to try to get him to sign a contract relinquishing his control of the cloth so that production can be suppressed . when he catches on to this  guiness stands up and turns to walk to the door . two men block his way .  excuse me   he says quietly  taking a step forward . the two men move between guiness and the camera . cut . a secretary is sitting outside at her desk . there is silence until the buzzer begins signaling her frantically . she takes up her notebook and opens the door to the inner office where a full  fledged noisy donnybrook is in progress and the room is half wrecked . guiness dashes out the open door .  br    br   the following example would be unthinkable today . during the research phase of his invention guiness sets up an elaborate chemical apparatus but instead of converting the experimental liquid into the new cloth  the device explodes . again and again it explodes . the laboratory is cleared of all other work . the blasts continue . ceilings fall down . windows are blown out . the director of research is seated at his desk in a tiny office cluttered with debris  a bandage on his head . when the door behind him opens he jumps a foot in the air .  sit down   he tells his visitor   there  s another one due at any moment .  it is excruciatingly amusing   and there is not a single shot of any explosions . this would be unimaginable now without a fireball  and maybe a building collapsing in slow motion .  br    br   last example  consisting of a series of quick  relentless cuts  put together precisely . guiness is being pursued and is cornered in the lobby of an office building by people who want him to sign the contract . faced with two men about to grapple with him  guiness backs up with a determined expression . he bumps against a pedestal with an iron bust on it . the bust topples backward and bumps against the wall . there is a shot lasting about one second of the bust hitting the wall . another brief shot of a metal shield hung above the bust being jarred loose and falling down . quick cut to guiness  s head rising into the frame . cut to the two men staring into the camera while horrible brass banging and thudding sounds are heard off screen . cut to guiness flat on his back . nobody today would have the cojones to not show guiness being crowned by that shield .  br    br   i won  t go on with this . it  s a comedy alright but a pretty bitter one underneath all the hilarity . in solving one set of problems  guiness has created dozens of others . he is opposed both by management and labor  neither of which is shown to much advantage . and of course the economic implications have to do with more than cloth .  what about that car that runs on water with a pinch of something or other in it   one of the workers asks .  vested interests   comments another worker  as thorstein veblen nods in his grave . what would happen if our problems with energy were solved overnight  if i owned shares of exxon   and i think i do   i  d shudder at the thought . where would the oil industry be if there were no more need for oil  for that matter  where would the police force and the fbi be if crime were to suddenly disappear  this is a thoughtful and very amusing movie  superbly directed and edited . the roster of performers is peerless . joanne greenwood with that husky voice . the blithering cecil parker . the wheezing mummified ernest thesiger .  br    br   a first  rate job all around .  ,1
ok  this movie was cool . i don  t think it was the best movie ever made but it sure was fun . my brother and i still act out scenes once in a while  and will occasionally yank the movie out of the cupboard  blow off the dust and pop it in . enjoyable all the way until the end  but a great concept . this is a movie that one has to just forget criticism all together and just enjoy . judgment is victory for robot jox .  ,1
i  m a jean harlow fan  because she had star quality . i don  t think her movies are good and i don  t even think that she was a good actress  but she certainly was great in comedies . every bit of comedy in the girl from missouri is very good . but this movie is perhaps more like a love story . jean harlow is wonderful in this one and you can forget the rest of the cast  their performances bring nothing new . it always impresses me much to think that harlow  s beautiful body was that of an ill woman . well  in this movie she does look beautiful .  ,0

this should be re  titled  the curious case of the unscrupulous filmmakers who misrepresented a non  horror snorer as a shock film .  it  s one long  boring tale of a fraternity hazing  a gag so transparent that even flounder from delta house could see through it . jeff east  an actor in the dues  paying stage  can be forgiven for taking any work he could get . the same can  t be said for charles martin smith  who formerly acted for such cinematic heavyweights as george lucas and sam peckinpah . once available on tape but  thankfully  not out on dvd . misrepresented garbage like this belongs in a landfill and nowhere else .  ,0
a lonely depressed french boy mathieu  jeremie elkaim  on vacation in the summer  meets and falls in love with cedric  the gorgeous stephane rideau  . quiet and slow this is a very frustrating movie . on one hand  i was absorbed by it and really felt for the two boys . on the other i was getting annoyed   the film constantly keeps flashing around from the past to the present with no rhyme or reason . it  s very confusing and pointless .  br    br   spoilers ahead     br    br   also there are tons of plot holes   mathieu  at one point  does something that ends him up in the hospital . what is it   we  re never told  then he breaks up with cedric and tells everybody else he  s living with him . why  we  re not told . then he hooks up inexplicably with another guy at the end . why  no explanation . it  s clear cedric loves mathieu and mathieu is living in the same town so . . . however it is a tribute to the film that you really care about the characters so much . if only things were explained   br    br   elkaim as mathieu is not good . he  s tall  handsome and has a nice body   but he can  t act . his idea of acting is sitting around with a blank look on his face   all the time . rideau  on the other hand  is great . he  s very handsome  has a very nice body and is one hell of an actor . also he has an incredible sexual magnetism about him . there is full frontal male nudity  lots of kissing and a fairly explicit sex scene in the movie which is great   most movies shy away from showing male  male love scenes . this one doesn  t and it helps to see how the characters care and feel for each other .  br    br   so  a frustrating film but somewhat worth seeing   especially for rideau  s nude scenes   that is  if you like good  looking nude young men   br    br    ,1
although george c . scott is the only actor in this version of acc without a british accent  he more than makes up for it with his over  the  top and larger  than  life interpretation of ebenezer scrooge .  br    br   particularly effective is when he confronts bob cratchit in his office at the movie  s end . as scott stands before a large window  sunlight casts a glowing mantle over him all you can see is his silhouette . augmented by scott  s voice  a ponderous growl  the effect is galvanizing . . . much like marlon brando  s first scene in apocalypse now .  the horror   indeed   br    br   however  as they say  the very thing that works for you can also work against you . because scott displays such gleeful ferocity throughout the movie  it proves infectious . to put it another way  the  before  scrooge is almost as charismatic as the  after   even though he really shouldn  t be . it  s what you might call the  doctor smith  effect  since jonathan harris used a very similar approach when playing that role and numerous other heavies  stage and screen alike  .  br    br   actually  i myself don  t consider scott  s glib rage a liability . but other  christmas carol  purists might . see the film and judge for yourselves .  ,1
i generally like watching burt lancaster  s films   especially when he is needed to go nuts with his imposing screen presence like in elmer gantry . however  his greatest strength  his magnetism  was occasionally also his greatest weakness as he rarely  if ever  underplayed anything . and it is this lack of subtlety that really hinders the rainmaker . now i understand that his character was meant to be a sort of showman but how katherine hepburn could fall under his spell is completely inexplicable . she is supposed to be smart but doesn  t seem so when lancaster  s blarney is being thrown about the screen  in addition to this  the story is perhaps one of the most stagy looking films i have ever seen and it is way too obvious that this is a movie based on a play . it just looks like it was mostly filmed in a sound stage instead of in the great wide open west like it was supposed to be .  br    br   overall  a very overrated film .  ,0
the energetic young producer of theatrical prologues  those staged performances  usually musical  that often proceeded the movie in the larger cinemas in bygone days  must deal with crooked competition  fraudulent partners  unfaithful lovers  amateur talent to realize his dream of making his mark on the footlight parade .  br    br   while closely resembling other warner  s musical spectaculars  notably the golddigger films  this movie had a special attraction none of the others had jimmy cagney . he is a wonder  loose  jointed and lithe  as agile as any tomcat  a creature he actually mimics a few times during the movie . cagney grabs the viewers attention  never lets go  powering the rapid  fire dialogue and corny plot with his charisma  buoyant charm .  br    br   the rest of the cast gives their best  as well . joan blondell is perfect as the smart  mouthed  big  hearted blonde secretary  infatuated with cagney  major quibble  why wasn  t she given a musical number   . dick powell  ruby keeler once again play lovers onstage  off the fact that her singing  acting abilities are a bit on the lean side are compensated for by her dancing  powell still exudes boyish enthusiasm in his unaccustomed position as second male lead .  br    br   guy kibbee  hugh herbert are lots of fun as brothers  in  law  both scheming to cheat cagney in different ways . ruth donnelly scores as kibbee  s wealthy wife  a woman devoted to her handsome protgs . frank mchugh  s harried choreographer is an apt foil for cagney  s wit . herman bing is hilarious in his one tiny scene as a music arranger . mavens will spot little billy barty  jimmy conlin  maybe even john garfield during the musical numbers .  br    br   finally  there  s busby berkeley  choreographer nonpareil . his terpsichorean confections  sprinkled throughout the decade of the      s  were a supreme example of the cinematic escapism that depression audiences wanted to enjoy . the big joke about berkeley  s creations  of course  was that they were meant  as part of the plot  to be stage productions . but no theater could ever hold these products of the master  s imagination . they are perfect illustrations of the type of entertainment only made possible by the movie camera .  br    br   berkeley  s musical offerings generally took one of two different approaches  either a story  often rather bizarre  told with song  dance or else stunning geometrically designed numbers  eye candy  featuring plentiful chorus girls  overhead camerawork  a romantic tune . in a spasm of outr extravagance  footlight parade climaxes with three berkeley masterworks honeymoon hotel  and its pre  production code telling of a couple  s wedding night by a waterfall   dozens of unclad females  splashing  floating  diving in perfect patterns  designs  peer closely  you  ll see how the synchronous effects were achieved   and finally  shanghai lil   a fitting tribute to the talents of both cagney  berkeley .  ,1

there aren  t too many times when i see a film and go   huh  what    but this was one of them . maybe after seeing zabriskie point i felt much the same way woody allen felt after seeing      he only liked the film after seeing it three times over a two year period  realizing the filmmaker was ahead of him in what was going on . michelangelo antonioni  in one of his few tries at making films inside of the us  after red desert  he did blow  up  this film  china  and the passenger  all filmed outside his native italy   i could sense he almost tried to learn about the ways of the country through his own mastery of the medium . the results show that he doesn  t lack the means to present images  feelings  tones  colors  sounds  and a visual representation of this era .  a director  s job is to see   antonioni once stated . whatever that means  he doesn  t disappoint for the admirer of his post  fifties work  i say post  fifties since i  ve yet to see any of his films from before l  avventura  .  br    br   what he does lack is a point  at least the kind of point that he could bring in blow  up and the eclipse . you get the feeling of what is around these characters  what the themes are bringing forth to their consciousness  however in this case the characters and the actors don  t bring much conviction or purpose . antonioni  coming from the school of hard  knocks  neo  realistic film  making  does do what he can with his mostly non  professional cast  those who look most like real actors are subjugated to the roles of the corporate characters   but the two stars mark frechette and daria halprin seem as if antonioni  s under  directing them . perhaps that was the point . the story  s split into three acts  thankfully not too confusing  as mark escapes his existence around the boiling  dangerous campus life going on in the circa late    s la area  and daria is sent out from la to drive to phoenix for some business meeting . they meet by chance as mark  s plane  how does he know how to drive  maybe a little background info there   and daria  s car meet up  and they spend some time together in an existential kind of groove out in the desert . aside from a stylistically mesmerizing if bizarre sex scene  much of this act isn  t terribly interesting .  br    br   the two leads are fair enough to look at  but what exactly draws them to each other outside of curiosity  the ideas that come forth  in part from a screenplay co  written by sam shepard  aren  t too revealing  except for one brief instant where drugs vs . reality is brought up . then the film heads towards the third act  as mark decides to do the right thing  under disastrous circumstances  and daria arrives at her boss  place  only to be in full disillusionment  not taking into account the infamous last five minutes or so of the film  . although the film took its time telling its story  i didn  t have as much of a problem with that as i did that the story only engages a certain kind of viewer . i understand and empathize with the feelings and doubts and fears as well as the self  confidence of the  anti  establishment   but maybe antonioni isn  t entirely fully aware of it himself . in some scenes he as director and editor  and the often astounding cinematography by alfio contini  find the scenery and backgrounds more enlightening and fixating than the people in the foreground . not to say the technical side of zabriskie point isn  t involving to a degree  this may make some feel drowsy  as antonioni is probably far greater as a documentary filmmaker as he is a theatrical director like say francis ford coppola is  .  br    br   the deserts  skies  city  and even the faces in close  ups are filmed with the eye of a filmmaker in love with the art of getting things in the frame  bringing us in . the soundtrack is equally compelling  with a master stroke including a sweet rolling stones song at one point  and then a crushing  surreal pink floyd song  re  titled from  careful with that axe eugene  one of their best pre  dark side  in the explosion sequence . if only the performances weren  t so one  sided i might find this to be on par with blow  up or the eclipse . it  s an unconventional stroke of genius on one hand  and on the other a boring take on what was the hippie  radical movement of the late    s . but hey  what may be boring for an american such as myself born in the eighties may not be to others outside the us  such as say  italy . and it does ask to not be discarded right away after one viewing .  ,1
besides the fact that my list of favorite movie makers is   stanley kubrick   god allmighty   the rest . . . this movie actually is better than the book  and the tv miniseries though this is an easy feat  considering the director  . the flawless filming stile  the acting and  kubrick  s all time number one skill  the music  make it the masterpiece of horror . i watched the tv miniseries a few years ago and liked the story and i had my hopes about this when i got a hold of it . it blew me away    it is far better than i ever imagined it . it starts slow  kubrick trademark  and has a lot of downtime that builds up the suspense . the intro scene is a classic by all means and i watched it about   times just for the shear atmosphere it induces to the whole film . also the film doesn  t offer a lot of gore  it has just enough and it is by no means tasteless  a trend that i hate in recent day horror films . just watch it   ,1

una giornata particolare is a film which has made brilliant use of closed spaces . it is in these dull  empty spaces that the audience sees the emotional turmoil and boisterous outbursts of ettore scola  s two leading characters . marcello mastroianni and sophia loren play two frustrated individuals who decide to come together for some brief moments of their listless lives . it is the element of sadness associated with the narrative that makes us believe that people will take sides with characters close to them . all men would really feel sorry for sophia loren  s character . all women would surely cry their hearts out at marcello mastroianni  s existential plight . disguised sexualities are also one of the key issues of this somber  poignant film . most of the characters grapple with issues related to their own sexualities . una giornata particolare cannot be termed as a pro gay film although it has been nicely depicted that a homosexual chap mixes well with women . this is a film for which italian director ettore scola has crafted a fairly good mix of fact and fiction . his idea is to show how the arrival of hitler changed destinies of ordinary italian folks . a word about the courageous personnage played magnificently by great marcello mastroianni . he acts as a real man who does not beg for pity . he happily accepts his fate and readies himself to face the worst time of his short yet meaningful life . a true masterpiece of cinema     ,1
had placed this on my tivo for a rainy day due to the cast  some really hard working people in the industry  and when i finally watched i was not disappointed .  br    br   this movie has some altman  like flavor  he  s mentioned in the end credits as a  thanks  person  utilizing seemingly independent unrelated plot lines that intertwine as the film draws to its climax . macy is pure  clean  and honest as a man who can  t seem to escape his  destiny   sutherland plays and portrays as few can  neve adds splash to a deliberately toned down environment  add tracy ullman  barbara bain  remember mission impossible on tv    not to mention the steady john ritter and you have all the ingredients for a good film . the script is uncluttered  the dialog is free from clich and thoughtful  especially between macy and david dorfman  . suspend belief and enjoy  this is truly time well spent .  ,1

i love john saxon in anything he  s in . the one time he takes over the camera though he directs a movie that should have more aptly been been titled  please do not watch this movie called zombie death house  . the      dollar shock insurance certificate is dear fred olen ray  s tricky way of making you spend   dollars on a filmed dump churned out by a major    s cheese legend . ray being the front man at retromedia . ray by the way makes charles band look hotter than stucco ceilings on a ford falcon . just plain bad now  the both of them  and boring besides . it  s great that ray is digging up this old stuff and in some cases it  s public domain like the rest of the dollar video hucksters but in the case of zombie death house   the word  zombie  sloppily superimposed to add ownership and interest on the part of f . o . r .  the only way to do service to this tripe is to release it on the dollar market for the curious collector and fans of saxon    if you wanna see real saxon  pick up black christmas  nightmare on elm street or the glove .  ,0
i was lucky enough to have seen this on a whim during a film festival and was smacked so hard with what i saw i returned the next night for its second of three screenings . a funny  savage and sharp  toothed attack on every aspect of mainstream entertainment passively swallowed without tasting by the lowest  common  denominator target audience waged by a lone  avenger journalist who slowly takes in members for his guerilla  war on predictability is what the movie  s all about  and is executed in such an unpredictable and refreshing way that you  re left after the credits roll with hope renewed  and excited that original films can still be made . anyone frustrated with unfulfilled expectations for something to light up their imaginations would do well to hunt  and i do mean hunt  this scarcely  seen item down . for fans of fight club and any charlie kaufman film  and required viewing for anyone who avoids multiplexes like a rabid dog .  ,1
they had an opportunity to make one of the best romantic tragedy mafia movies ever because they had the actors  the budget  and the story but the great director john huston was too preoccupied trying to mellow out this missed classic . strenuously trying to find black humor as often as possible which diluted the movie very much . and also they were so uncaring with details like sound and detailed action . maybe it was the age of the director who passed away two years later .  ,0
well  i don  t think the picture is as bad as most of the reviews make it out to be . . . but there  s no denying that it  s got problems .  br    br   mostly  the problems are in the script . there  s a plot  but not much story  and certainly not one that anybody could call plausible it trots out any number of self  consciously strange and  or stereotypical characters  lines  moments  what  have  you and  by the end  it just hasn  t added up to much in this department .  br    br   sorry  but i couldn  t care less about whatever  social ill  farnsworth might be trying to address there will always be a sector of the population willing to do just about anything to shred their brains  even if it requires running around corn fields trying to steal ammonia  or whatever it is those morons do . so  as a film  you won  t find me calling  iowa   important .  but  at a stylistic level  the picture is more than interesting and some of farnsworth  s choices in depicting a meth  head  s wigged  out state are beautiful  hilarious  disturbing and  yes  i  m going to say it  inspired .  br    br   the acting is uneven  but that just may be a casualty of the afore  praised stylistic reaching . look  rosanna arquette is a fine actress  but she  s not very good here  so a discriminating audience member does have to ask   what happened   it  s weird that diane foster manages a simplicity and grace that so few of the other actors can come anywhere near . for example  i might seriously consider whatever explanation farnsworth could provide for michael t . weiss  s over  the  top turn as a probation officer  but i doubt i  d ever buy it it just doesn  t work .  br    br   then again  it  s the most alive and in the moment that i  ve seen john savage appear in years . so go figure .  br    br   this is the sort of work that tantalizes  but does not promise  and that  s okay neither farnsworth nor anyone else is required to make movies . so  whether or not farnsworth has another film in him remains to be seen  but if he does  it seems pretty likely that it won  t be bland pap . in an age when people are planning their lives around the latest installment of  american idol   perhaps we could allow  not scorn  farnsworth  s legitimate and undeniably flawed film .  br    br   what is more  perhaps we could welcome  not berate  his energetic and sometimes blessedly idiosyncratic imagination .  ,0
i loved it  having been a fan of the original series  i have always wondered what the back story would be  it didn  t fail to delight me . i also love the fact that apart from eric stoltz i didn  t recognise one person  this is refreshing  much like bsg . it has introduced me to a whole wealth of new talent  can  t wait for the series to start airing . well done to ronald d . moore and team  excellent job . the special effects  dialogue and acting were all spot on  and i felt emotionally tied up in the storyline . i know there are purists out there that will probably disagree with my assessment  but i felt that caprica was far superior to most of the sci  fi stuff produced in the last decade .  ,1

by     columbia was a full  fledged major studio and could produce a movie with the same technical polish as mgm  paramount or warners . that  s the best thing that could be said about  adam had four sons   a leaden soap opera with almost terminally bland performances by ingrid bergman  top  billed for the first time in an american film  and warner baxter . bergman plays a frenchwoman  this was the era in which hollywood thought one foreign accent was as good as another  hired as governess to baxter  s four sons and staying on  with one interruption caused by the stock  market crash of      until the boys are grown men serving in world war i . just about everyone in the movie is so goody  good it  s a relief when susan hayward as the villainess enters midway through  she  s about the only watchable person in the movie even though she  s clearly channeling bette davis and vivien leigh it  s also the first in her long succession of alcoholic roles  but the script remains saccharine and the ending is utterly preposterous . no wonder bergman turned down the similarly plotted  the valley of decision  four years later .  ,0

i love sharks . and mutants . and explosions . theoretically  with those parameters in mind  hammerhead shark frenzy should have been the best movie ever .  br    br   it is not .  br    br   the monster looks like a villain from power rangers  and has approximately the same range of rubbery movement . this might be okay if the makers weren  t quite as proud of its design as they seem to be . that is to say  for a guy in a big rubber suit in an action  scifi  horror flick that could benefit from some mystery  the shark gets a lot of screen time . granted  it is usually shaky and erratic . i guess you  re supposed to assume that it  s so scary that even the camera guy freaks out .  br    br   the camera goes to a person about to get eaten  the camera goes to the shark . the camera goes back to the person about to get eaten  only now they are screaming and armless . and so on .  br    br   the costuming is bad  the acting is poor  and the special effects are sub  par  but the writing is by far the worst . things happen completely randomly so that more people can be eaten  or so something can explode . because let me tell you  the people who made this movie definitely went in with a more explosions  more better mindset . characters shoot cars and there is a massive explosion . they shoot helicopters  there is a massive explosion . barrels  rocks  trees  whatever  they all explode  so much so that the freaking shark even explodes at the end .  br    br   speaking of which  i don  t care how crazy a person is  i find it hard to believe that anyone would think trying to make a giant half  person half  shark have sex with a woman in order to make freaky shark people babies is a good idea . that is  unless that person is the mad scientist in this movie .  br    br   the bad thing is  the movie is so random  and at times  boring  that even its badness is not really enough to hold a person  s prolonged interest . it might be a good one to mst  k with your friends  but past that  if you happen to catch this bad boy on  do yourself a favor and change the channel .  ,0

warner bros . made many potboilers in the     s and most of them are fast paced  economical and very entertaining . i really love how the studio exploited the less glamorous elements of our daily life . this is one of warner  s few hard  edged melodramas that simply doesn  t work . edward g . robinson plays a ruthless editor of newspaper who resurrects the    year old story of a murderess with tragic consequences . robinson gives a lively performance but he is surrounded by actors that don  t cut the mustard . h . b . warner  aline macmahon and boris karloff are good  but the bad acting of frances starr and anthony bushell in the second leads really hurts the movie . starr is particularly bad during her big dramatic scene near the end of the movie . in addition  the moralistic tone of the film seems ridiculous in the context of pre  code hollywood . leroy  s direction is full of innovative visual touches but he cannot overcome the bad acting and the unintentionally funny situations . sol polito  s camera work is strong . somehow  this piece of dreck got an oscar nomination for best picture  in a year that gave us  m    dracula  and  frankenstein   .  ,0
the original book of this was set in the     s but that won  t do for the tv series because most people watch for the     s style . ironically the tube train near the end was a     s train painted to look like a     s train so the underground can play at that game too . hanging the storyline on a plot about the jarrow march was feeble but the   s version had students who were beginning to think about the world around them so i suppose making them think about the poverty of the marchers is much the same thing . all the stuff about japp having to cater for himself was weak too but they had to put something in to fill the time . this would have made a decent half hour show or they could have filmed the book and made it a better long show . it is obvious this episode is a victim of style over content .  ,0

you gotta wonder how some flics ever get made . . . this one decided to skip with the why among many other things and just wanders off beyond the moot .  br    br   and yet you have a number of decent actors doing their best to pump some life into the story . the blue tint throughout the movie overshoots into  yet again   which on its own would be depressing but here it  s overkill . the idea that it  s not a medical condition  not some house or gypsy or trinket curse but just something that for no apparent reason starts to happen to our protagonist and then to everyone else around her  just winds up being much like taking a big swig out of an empty mug . some doppelgangers have super powers but others don  t or don  t know they do  it seems they  re just as clueless as we are .  br    br   it  s a poor man  s rip  off of  invasion of the body  snatchers  with keifer sutherland  s  mirror  and  the sixth sense   were you to seriously botch those three together .  ,0
the story for hare rama hare krishna actually came to dev anand  s mind when he saw hippies and their fallen values in kathmandu where he was on a visit after the protests against his previous prem pujari in calcutta . he was low in spirits because his film had been opposed and some had burnt prem pujari  s posters . but the life of hippies re ignited a story in dev  s mind to be made into a film .  br    br   this was dev anand  s perhaps best directorial effort . the film was a blockbuster super hit at the box office and zeenat aman as dev  s sister made a tremendous impact .  br    br   this film was dev anand  s call to the nation to keep up their moral values .  br    br   it is about a montereal based indian family and the brother  s role is a very affectionate one for his sister . but the parents quarrel and separate leaving prashant  dev  with mother and jasbir  zeenat  with father . she is repeatedly told that her mother and brother are dead and she eventually believes that she will never see prashant again .  br    br   she is ill treated by her step mother and she runs away from home . dev grows up to be a pilot and he learns that jasbir is in kathmandu with certain hippies .  br    br   to reunite with his sister  dev travels to kathmandu and meets shanti  mumtaz  who was to later marry him and also janice who in reality is jasbir with a new name and new identity . she has forgotten her childhood and dev too .  br    br   dev has to get his sister back amongst all other happenings which include his being suspected as a thief in kathmandu and the people are after his life .  br    br   this was a story well directed and acted  both by dev anand . we see more of zeenat aman than of mumtaz . but the music by rahul dev burman was well composed . dev had first offered the music to be composed by sachin dev burman but burman da did not want dev to do the film . he was very close to dev and his earlier film prem pujari  though was good  but had been opposed in calcutta . burman da wanted dev to try a lighter subject as he thought hippie cultist film might reignite people  s anger against dev . but dev continued with the film reassuring burman da and the film was indeed a success .  br    br   r d burman had asha bhosle sing the award winning dum maro dum . kanchi re kanchi re was another good number .  br    br   overall it is a good film .  ,1
this really is an incredible film . not only does it document the eternal struggle of indigenous and disenfranchised people to gain their rightful voice but it also shows the united states up for its dishonesty  subterfuge  and blatant disregard for human rights and self  determination . chavez is shown as a very brave and charismatic leader struggling against what can only be characterized as a despicable elite devoid of any sense of proportion or justice . these filmmakers have recorded a coup unlike anything witnessed before .  br    br   and in the cross hairs we see the usa  once again pulling the strings and blurring all sense of reality . it  s heart  breaking to watch the initial stages of the revolt knowing full well that the subversion of democracy that we  re witnessing is a tool long used by successive american governments and their seemingly blinkered citizens . the footage makes it clear that this is not a manipulation of tv or generic footage but an active documentation of a people and its government fighting for its future . truly a moving experience for anyone with a conscience . these irish film makers deserve our gratitude . long live chavez .  br    br   we need to enshrine the notion that each country must be allowed to choose its government and to develop in ways that the majority sees fit . first phase in this process is the need to know what the realities of the situation are  and this documentary does a great job of doing just that .  ,1
depending entirely on your own personal state of mind when watching this   christmas evil  can either turn out to become an ambitious and innovative psychological thriller or one of the most pathetic and infuriatingly lame holiday  themed slashers ever made . me  personally  i  m tempted to opt for the latter because i didn  t bother to do any research at all and simply anticipated a cheesy and undemanding early    s slasher with a nutcase in a santa clause costume butchering people . wrong  the movie actually handles about a bloke named harry stadling who  s obsessed with christmas  works in a rubbish toy factory and considers it to be his responsibility to determine on christmas eve who deserves presents and who deserves punishment . harry  s issues all started when he witnessed santa  his daddy in a costume obviously  caress his mommy  s naked legs at a tenderly young age . after that he just developed into a social outcast  much to the irritation of his younger brother  who  s bound to snap one  holi  day . i fully understand why certain fans appreciate this slightly eccentric horror movie  but did it really have to be so boring  there are several overlong and seemingly endless parts of the film in which absolutely nothing happens . i can forgive the shortness of gore and outrageous bloodshed  but this movie doesn  t even benefice from an unsettling atmosphere or unexpectedly demented plot twists  with the notable exception of the finale  i must admit  . also  i would have taken the concept more seriously if the crazed protagonist would focus himself on lethally punishing the naughty children  he doesn  t and exclusively kills misbehaving adults . how are you supposed to take wannabe controversial and original christmas thriller serious when santa doesn  t even commit one miserable child murder  that would have made  christmas evil  a classic  whereas now it  s just a forgettable and pitiable piece of junk .  ,0
the men can slaver over lollo  if they like  or her lollos   she gave her name to a slang terms for breasts in french   but the ladies have an even tastier morsel in the divine gerard philipe  who is not only beautiful but can act . don  t be deterred if your version has no subtitles because in this simple  dashing story of love and war  in which all is fair  they are not needed . all you need know is that  at the beginning of the film  lollobrigida reads philipe  s palm and tells him he will marry the daughter of the king . thereafter the story is quite plain from the gallic gestures and the running  jumping  and swordplay .  br    br   on the minus side  the obviousness of the story and the heavy  handed facetiousness of the tone become somewhat wearying  and it is annoying that the french apparently consider themselves too superior to hollywood to bother even attempting the plausibility of its exciting stunts . and of course the non  french  speaker misses the occasional bit of ooh  la  la  such as virtuous girl i must tell you that my heart belongs to fanfan . seducer my dear  what made you think i was interested in that bagatelle   ,1
this is quite possibly the worst acting i have ever seen in a movie . . . ever . and what is up with the casting . the leading lady in this movie has some kind of nose dis  figuration and is almost impossible to look at for any period of time without becoming fixated on her nose . you could go to your local grocery store on a sunday afternoon and easily find   more qualified  better looking possible leading ladies . i made the unfortunate mistake of renting this movie because it had a  cool  dvd case . this movie looks like it is just some class project for a group of multimedia students at a local technical college . i would rather have spent the hour or so that this movie was on watching public access television . . . at least the special effects are better and the people on there are more attractive than anyone you will see in this film  ,0
if fassbinder has made a worse film  i sure don  t want to see it  anyone who complains that his films are too talky and claustrophobic should be forced to view this  to learn to appreciate the more spare style he opted for in excellent films like  the bitter tears of petra von kant  . this film bogs down with so much arty  quasi  symbolic images it looks like a parody of an  art  film  . the scene in the slaughterhouse and the scene where elvira  s prostitute friend channel  surfs for what seems like ten minutes are just two of the most glaring examples of what makes this film a real test of the viewer  s endurance . but what really angers me about it are the few scenes which feature just elvira and her ex  wife and  or her daughter . these are the only moments that display any real human emotion  and prove that at the core of this horrible film  there was an excellent film struggling to free itself . what a waste .  ,0
this is an astounding film . as well as showing actual footage of key events in the failed coup to oust chavez  we are given the background picture which describes a class  divided society . many of the rich  it appears  have a choice with the people  s democratic choice  and are willing to use the military for regime change .  be careful what you say in front of your servants  is a revealing comment . the head of the country  s biggest oil company appoints himself as the new president  with us backing  and these young irish film makers have it all on camera . a great film to educate young people about democracy . we see transparent documentation of how media can be manipulated  and force used  in the interests of big business  against the interests of the democratic wishes of the people . riveting stuff .  ,1
new york has never looked so good  and neither has anyone in this movie . while the script is a bit lightweight you can  t help but like this movie or any of the characters in it . you almost wish people like this really existed . the appeal of the actors are what really put it over  john ritter  colleen camp and the late dorothy stratten are particularly good .  go ahead and rent or buy this movie you  ll be glad you did .  ,1
a shaky hand  held camera was used  presumably to give the film a documentary look  but the effect was so exaggerated that i started to get motion  sickness just from watching it . it looked like someone with cerebral palsy was holding the camera  no offense meant to cp sufferers  but i don  t think you would expect to get much work as a cinematographer   the camera work was so nauseating  and so distracting  that my wife and i considered it unwatchable and gave up on it after   minutes of torture . i checked back a while later  it was showing on tv   and it hadn  t gotten any better . i suggest giving this one a miss unless you need to get rid of any bad sushi you may have eaten   ,0
for the most part  on demand delivers some pretty horrible horror movies  and only offers other horror movies everyone has already seen  and already have an opinion on . it was either this  or invinicible  i like mark wahlberg movies   which i haven  t seen  and i was actually in a movie watching mood  which doesn  t happen often anymore because i  ve already watched all the movies i own a million times  and that  s a lot of movies  and i don  t have much interest in new movies  and boy  this movie made me regret it . i  m not going to put in any spoilers  i  m just going to tell you that only a few of the very few actors in this movie  are half way decent . i think the main girl  the dead one who kills everyone  is very annoying looking  but convincing i  d take her for psycho bitch anyday  so she fits her roll well  though it is lame . the blood isn  t that great  only a few of the kills  or may i say  woundings  are alright  but you don  t see much and there are no body part props in the movie to make the injuries look more convincing . towards the end of the movie i was begging my girlfriend to turn it off  and being a band member  the  recording  parts weren  t very interesting either  though what happened would truly happen when going about recording . i  m done  if you want to watch this  suit yourself .  ,0
this is a great little film  that  s very unique  and creative  with some great plot twists and wonderful performances  . all the characters are great  and the story while bizarre  is fascinating and very interesting  plus nicole kidman is simply amazing in this  . it  s very hard to describe this movie  because it really is quite bizarre  it  s a comedy  romance  one minute then it turns into a thriller the next  however it was still very entertaining all the same  plus nicole  s russian accent was fantastic  and extremely convincing . chaplin and kidman had very good chemistry together  and i loved vincent cassel  s performance   plus some of the plot twists really took me by surprise  . the ending was very cute  and it  s unpredictable throughout   plus this movie is quite underrated as well  . you will feel sorry for chaplin and the way that he is scammed  and i thought all the characters were really likable  plus the finale is especially good . this is nicole  s movie though  and she carries it with her incredibly sexy performance  . this is a great little film  that  s very unique  and creative  with some great plot twists and wonderful performances   i highly recommend this one  . the direction is very good  . jez butterworth does a very good job here  with great camera work  solid angles and keeping the film at a fast pace  . the acting is wonderful  . nicole kidman  is stunningly gorgeous   and is amazing as always  she is incredibly sexy  very likable  had one of the coolest accents  added a lot of presence  had very good chemistry with ben chaplin  and had a very mysterious character   she was amazing .  kidman rules      . ben chaplin is great here  he is extremely likable  had a cool character  had very good chemistry with kidman  the only thing i didn  t like was him taking out his anger out on kidman  even though what she did was wrong  and i loved how he got revenge in the end  . vincent cassel is fantastic as the main villain  yes he was ott  but he was very intense and quite creepy at times  this role was perfect for him . mathieu kassovitz is ok here  but didn  t have much to do . rest of the cast are fine . overall i highly recommend this one  .     out of   ,1
this movie should have never been made . from the poorly done animation  to the beyond bad acting . i am not sure at what point the people behind this movie said  ok  looks good  lets do it   i was in awe of how truly horrid this movie was . at one point  which very may well have been the worst point  a computer generated saber tooth of gold falls from the roof stabbing the idiot creator of the cats in the mouth . . . uh  ooookkkk . the villain of the movie was a paralyzed sabretooth that was killed within minutes of its first appearance . the other two manages to kill a handful of people prior to being burned and gunned down . then  there is a random one awaiting victims in the jungle . . . which scares me for one sole reason . will there be a part two  god  for the sake of humans everywhere i hope not .  br    br   this movie was pure garbage . from the power point esquire credits to the slide show ending .  ,0
with this movie being the only dirty harry movie which clint eastwood not only stars  but produces and directs as well  you know it  s got to be good . although some say that the enforcer is the best out of the series  i completely disagree . in my opinion  apart from the original dirty harry  sudden impact and magnum force are the only two worthy of being in the series . although the enforcer is an alright film with a couple of good action sequences  it doesn  t get the dirty and gritty impact that the other three films do . this film captures all the excitement that makes a clint eastwood film good  and it  s got the quotes that make a dirty harry film good . in diry harry it  s  . . well do ya  punk    in magnum force  a man  s got to know his limitations   and in this it  s  go ahead . make my day .  also in this film it  s nice to see a change of scenery  as you get a bit tired of seeing the same old san fransisco streets in the other films in the series . with great acting by clint eastwood and co  star sandra locke  and good directing by clint  this is in my opinion the best dirty harry sequel ever .  ,1
description corny  utterly stupid and worthless . it  s so cheap and lame  it  ll make you wonder why these abnormally dumb people even wasted  months or so to spend a budget  i  m guessing this . . .  probably no more than    dollars to make this movie . it was just hysterical to watch with or without mystery science theater . i am giving you the best advice in the world  br    br   spare yourself  spare your time  life  and money  by not   i repeat  not even ponder about whether you should see this movie . this movie is so corny  it  ll make your face turn purple of outraged boredom . if you have a one  digit iq  then be my guest and watch this absolutely despicable movie . you might actually admire it .  like i said before  if you have a one  digit iq   br    br   with about   actors of your own  a few puppets you bought at a garage sale  and of course cameras and music  i gaurentee you  ll make a slightly more entertaining home video than this piece of absolute crap .  ,0
sensual and tough maria braun .  hanna schygula  marries a soldier in the middle of world war ii and spends a half of day and the whole night with him . that  s how long her marriage lasts before she loses him to the war and then to prison . she carries on with her life  becomes a successful businesswoman being not only sensual but intelligent  ambitious  and willing to use sex whenever or wherever necessary  i don  t know a thing about business  but i do know what german women want . you might even say i  m an expert on it  . while climbing up to the success she always remembers her husband  hermann  her man  and convinces herself that whatever she does  is for him  for their future happy life together .  maria braun   s style reminds much of melodramas by fassbinder  s favorite hollywood director  douglas sirk and offers a glimpse of the loss and survival in postwar germany . hanna schygula literally shines in every scene of the movie and she is fantastic .  br    br    .      ,1
my god this movie is awfully boring . i am a big fan of gina gershon  when i rented this movie i expected a romantic drama  and some great performance from gershon . gershon is great as always  but she is not right actress for this role  she is too good for rade serbedzija . the romance between gershon and serbedzija  s characters is too unconvincing . and i absolutely hated serbedzija  s character  a wonman organizer   he is not charming in anyway in the movie . how did dr . lauren graham  gershon  is beyond my comprehension . maybe sean connery  robert deniro or harrison ford would have done a better job on this role  but they don  t have the european  ish looking i guess . any way  i was so bored druing the movie . if you are looking for a good gina gershon movie  check out bound  her best film so far . if you are looking for a romantic film about a younger woman and an older man  try some harrison ford or sean connery movies . gina gershon is so underrated  and she deserves better chance than this  i wish her to make better choice in the future .  ,0
a mediocre sci  fi channel original picture . a little squirmish  but not much . the nuclear powered submarine u . s . s . jimmy carter is on a mission deep below thick frigid ice near the north pole when it is attacked by giant super charged electric eels . a member of the crew  simmone jade mackinnon  thinks she has devised a way to communicate with the monsters  but is not given much chance for vague reasons . also among the crew aredavid keith  mark sheppard and sean whalen . this movie could have been somewhat better if the eels  monsters were not so cartoonish .  ,0
citizen x tells the real life drama of the search for a serial killer dubbed  the rostov ripper  this great film shows the long journey it took to try to apprehend a killer . the film shows how politics may haver helped the killer to continue his rampage for over   years .  possibly over   victims  mostly women and children  the performances of stephen rea as the lead detective and donald sutherland as the overall investigation lead was superb . jeffrey demunn as the ripper andrei romanovich chikatilo . this is the type of film which will mesmerize you and immediately have you on the internet researching the real case . this a film not to be missed . it debuted i believe on hbo and never did get a theatrical release to my understanding . great film  ,1
the only reason that i did not give this   stars was the dvd format  no menus  extras  etc . however  if you have ever had a dream to do something with your life  this film is for you . if you believe in yourself and your dream do not let anyone or anything stop you . this is one of the most life  affirming films that i have ever seen . and magical . the acting is superb  the plot serves the purpose  and the opening sequence is fantastic . this is one of those films that  cult  status used to be about . i have recommended this film to all of my friends . some love it  some can  t finish it . whenever i think  or feel  that something is impossible i think about alan arkin  s role in this film . sure wish he  d make more films .  ,1
i was lying on my bed  with a really bad cold or flu or whatever . i figure maybe i  d kill some time watching some horror movies my mom bought for me a little while ago . i wish i never picked this movie  after i watched it i felt even more sick and i wanted to throw up . afterwords  when i got better of course  i did some research on dennis l . rader and i noticed that the dennis in the movie was nothing like the real one . i hope that no one ever watches this movie but if they ever do don  t eat or you  ll feel the way i felt after i first watched it . i think you would have a better time watching the santa claus  . at least that movie had better reviews on this site .  ,0
yes  the southern star features a pretty forgettable title tune sung by that heavy set crooner matt monro . it pretty much establishes the tone for this bloated and rather dull feature  stunningly miscast with george segal and ursula andress as an adventurous couple in search of a large diamond . add in harry andrews  with a strange accent  no less  chasing an ostrich  tons of stock footage of wildlife  and poorly composed and dull photography by raoul coutard  and you end up with a thoroughly unexciting romp through the jungles of senegal .  ,0
amazing documentary . saw it on original airdate and on dvd a few times in the last few years . i was shocked that it wasn  t even nominated for a best documentary oscar for      the year it was released . no other documentary even comes close .  br    br   it was on tv recently for the  th anniversary  but i missed the added  where are they now  segment at the end  except i did catch that tony now works for the hazmat unit .  br    br   i  ve seen criticism on documentary film  making from a few on this list . i can  t see how this could have been done any different . they had less than  months to assemble this and get it on the air . the dvd contains more material and background .  br    br   i  m also surprised that according to imdb . com  the brother have had no projects in the four years since . what have they been doing   ,1
tashan  the title itself explains the nature of the movie .  br    br   this type of movies are actually made for flop . what a shame that yash raj films produces such movies those are worthless than c  grade movies . or even some c  grade movies have better and pleasing story than tashan . the much hyped and over  confidently promoted tashan poorly bombed at the box  office which it certainly deserved .  br    br   in my view  this is the worst movie ever made from honourable yash raj films  banner . how come they handled such a heavy project to new vijay krishna acharya who has no actual sense of making action flick  he tried to imitate sanjay gadhvi  s ways of making like dhoom but he suffered at last . the action scenes are more like than comics or cartoon movies made for exhausting the audiences .  br    br   the story also loses in its meaning and substances to tenderly win the audiences  hearts . in most scenes anil kapoor reminds me of southern tamil star rajnikant in his body languages and wordly expressions . i am not a fan of neither saif nor akshay  but the award of kareena should have finally gone to saif   s hand instead of akshay . just from the starting point i expected of it  but at the end it displeased me with the climax truth . saif is the main behind the whole adventure  while akshay joins in the midst . in any movie  the final should be judged with the whole characters of the entire story and the award or say reward should be given to the one who deserves credit . and tashan loses in this way  and unexpectedly failed to become a hit .  br    br   akshay  s has nothing new to show off his comedian talent here but still reminds of his previous movies . he seriously need to form a new image to his fans that would impress them again and again . in between saif did a great job in race  and now he returned again in his hilarious nature through this movie . but he has fully developed himself in the acting field . and last but not the least about kareena . she looks really hot with bikini dress of which some complain as she became too lean . but i myself don  t think so  instead she became slim . yes slim    it is a good factor for a female to attract the major people  or say  male  . beside them it is nice that saif  s son ibrahim appears in the beginning  last as young saif . i hope now he too will lean forward in target of making acting as his career .  br    br   those who like this tashan they are either mentally immatured or still want to go back to childhood  or say want to be admitted in an asylum . thumbs down to debutante director vijay krishna acharya who mishandled the project offered by yash raj films . in future he should experiment and study the script minimum of  years before going into practical directions .  br    br   sorry  i don  t like to rate good stars to this type of junk movies .  ,0
i was pleasantly surprised i quite liked this movie . witty writing  some  inside  jokes i got  others i didn  t  maybe due to actors speaking on top of one another   great acting  notably john cassini   great cameos  interesting and unique directing . i rented it to see jeffrey meek  very disappointed he was in it such a short time  blink and you  ll miss him   but found the movie remarkably entertaining . i  ll actually watch it again before i send back to netflix . i think actors and wanna  be actors will thoroughly enjoy this movie . the ending is somewhat expected but wish they  d done something different  and more positive  . too bad the movie wasn  t better received except for in the  festival  market . i suggest it to anyone who loves the acting biz .  ,1
the  trivia  page on imdb claims the filmmakers protested because this film was re  cut by the studio to  simplify the plot  . if so  that effort was a total failure  as this is one of the most incoherent narratives i  ve ever seen in a film   i  d hate to have seen it before the plot was  simplified .   br    br   it  s sad to see warren with so little character to go on that even he can  t do anything with the inept material . it  s interesting to see caron in    s mode instead of her hollywood  era glamour garb and persona  but it  s sad to see her haplessly wander through this doing  a  favor  to  her  producer  husband dreck . she would actually later hook up with and marry the director  instead   who  you  ll note  never directed anything again  but did strictly  st or  nd a . d . work in tv from here on out . that oughta tell you enough right there .  br    br   i call this  interesting  because i have an automatic fondness for american films of this period  and this role does add perspective to oates  otherwise fantastic     output  two  lane blacktop  the hired hand  . but the      s detective as fish  out  of  water in     s l . a .  theme  which is the only thing the movie really has to say  is sold in way too heavy  handed a manner . a similar theme would be far more effectively handled two years later in altman  s the long goodbye . and as far as oates playing a hard  bitten guy on a doomed errand  three years on  he would give his definitive performance in bring me the head of alfredo garcia . if you haven  t seen those  don  t waste your time with this   ,0
although i didn  t like stanley  iris tremendously as a film  i did admire the acting . jane fonda and robert de niro are great in this movie . i haven  t always been a fan of fonda  s work but here she is delicate and strong at the same time . de niro has the ability to make every role he portrays into acting gold . he gives a great performance in this film and there is a great scene where he has to take his father to a home for elderly people because he can  t care for him anymore that will break your heart . i wouldn  t really recommend this film as a great cinematic entertainment  but i will say you won  t see much bette acting anywhere .  ,1
i  ve seen a lot of movies and rarely would i ever rate a movie    but this movie was beyond terrible .  br    br   the acting was terrible  the plot was ridiculous  the effects were unrealistic and the characters were annoying . usually when i watch scary movies i think it  s dumb when the characters hears a noise in house  forest  school  etc and then yells out  hello is anyone there    but at least they  re believable when they do it . . this movie couldn  t even get that right .  br    br   this is a movie that  ll make other b  horror movies like venom and the fog look like academy award winning masterpieces .  br    br   i always have an open mind while watching movies and i can only say that this movie was a complete waste of time and i write this comment so that anyone else who  s thinking of watching this movie will think again . it  s awful   ,0
i really like this show . that is why i was disappointed to learn recently that george lopez is a racist  and that he fired masiela lusha off the show  simply because he discovered that she wasn  t a latino emigrant  but was an emigrant from albania . i learned this from people on the show . she was really one of the better parts of the show  and thus  to learn that even among those who you would think would be sensitive to racism  that they can also hate someone  just because of the country where they were born  is really disappointing . i really like this show . that is why i was disappointed to learn recently that george lopez is a racist  and that he fired masiela lusha off the show  simply because he discovered that she wasn  t a latino emigrant  but was an emigrant from albania . i learned this from people on the show . she was really one of the better parts of the show  and thus  to learn that even among those who you would think would be sensitive to racism  that they can also hate someone  just because of the country where they were born  is really disappointing .  ,1

this well conceived and carefully researched documentary outlines the appalling case of the chagos islanders  who  it shows  between     and      were forcibly deported en masse from their homeland through the collusion of the british and american governments . anglo  american policy makers chose to so act due to their perception that the islands would be strategically vital bases for controlling the indian ocean through the projection of aerial and naval power . at a time during the cold war when most newly independent post  colonial states were moving away from the western orbit  it seems british and american officials rather felt that allowing the islanders to decide the fate of the islands was not a viable option . instead they chose to effect the wholesale forcible removal of the native population . the film shows that no provision was made for the islanders at the point of their ejection  and that from the dockside in mauritius where they were left  the displaced chagossian community fell into three decades of privation  and in these new circumstances  beset by homesickness  they suffered substantially accelerated rates of death .  br    br   following the passage of more than three decades  however  in recent months  and years   following the release of many utterly damning papers from britain  s public record office  one rather suspects that there was some mistake  and these papers were not supposed to have ever been made public   resultant legal appeals by the chagossian community in exile have seen british courts consistently find in favour of the islanders and against the british state . as such  the astonishing and troubling conclusions drawn out in the film can only reasonably be seen as proved . nevertheless  the governments of great britain and the united states have thus far made no commitment to return the islands to what the courts have definitively concluded are the rightful inhabitants . this is a very worthwhile film for anyone to see  but it is an important one for britons and americans to watch . to be silent in the face of these facts is to be complicit in a thoroughly ugly crime .  ,1
there are many problems with mystery men . first of all there are too many different characters for all of them to be given complex or even interesting personalities . the special effects detract from the story and are not really that special . paul reubens is wasted in a pathetic  juvenile role as a character who merely farts and speaks in an inaudible accent .  br    br   now onto the decent parts . william h macy  three heavenly words  and his performance as the shoveler is pitch perfect . the sphinx is an exceptionally funny character who is only mysterious and merely spouts out the traditional mystical proverbs . ben stiller is very amusing as well  showing a weak character trying to make it into the big leagues of superheroes . all of the characters do  and that is an area which i found particuarly ironic . that is because all of the actors are indie film actors trying to make it into the big leagues of hollywood .  br    br   to be honest  the reason i thought it failed at the box  office is that america doesn  t get irony .  br    br   all in all i loved the film  but i feel it would have worked better if more effort was put into tweaking the script rather than having unneccesary cgi landscapes and effects .  ,1
by all the fawning people have been doing over miike and his work . i sat through this flick tonight . i figured  if it  s half as good as ringu  as i assumed from these comments it might be  than it will be worth my time .  br    br   no such luck .  br    br   i  m all for finding the next great director  or writer   but i don  t think miike is the one . i don  t have an nyu masters of fine arts  but i do know this much a horror movie has to have pacing . it also has to give the viewer more credulity than this movie does .  br    br   this film  s pacing had me shaking my head . some of the scenes near the end dragged so badly  i went to the fridge and lingered there while kou shibasaki stared at the camera for seemingly minutes on end  eyes wide and mouth agape . a famous director once made the claim  and i  m paraphrasing  a movie could be made by turning the camera on a beautiful woman and letting it roll . kou is not a good enough actress to make that work . she stares paralyzed at the undead girl for more scenes than i care to remember . and she isn  t the only one doing an impersonation of a deer in headlights other cast members apparently feel the need to imitate this non  performance . the script gives them little room to do much else for far too much of the time .  br    br   i like asian cinema . hong kong action flicks from the last   years  korean horror like  phone  and  koma   ang lee  s work  some of the trashy but fun filipino movies with gratuitous sex and fighting  as well as others . chakushin ari i could have done without .  ,0
lets enter the world of this movie for a second  so you can better understand the type of movie we are dealing with here .  br    br   edison is one of those really stupid movies where the bad guy and his goons have been letting loose       bullets shooting at the good guy behind walls and pillars  shouting at them  and then finally get to the good guy face to face and instead of killing him . . . . . . instead of wasting this guy that has caused you so much grief . . . . instead of just walking up and pop  . . . . . what do you do  the bad guy . . . . . he talks to him . he grabs the good guy and talks to him while holding his gun . they have nothing to talk about  shoot him  shoot him now  but he talks to him anyway . oh another thing . at the end  a newspaper says  pulitzer prize winner story right here  or something right above on a front page of a paper  when its like the first time the story is printed . so how in the heezy did someone win a pulitzer for it that fast  yea  you know those types of stupid movies  yea well that  s edison in a nutshell .  br    br   you get mr cool morgan freeman and shifty eyed tough kevin spacey who both phone in their roles completely  ll cool j who scowls literally every single moment of the movie  while proposing to his girlfriend in a damn night club of all places  and who  s last line  duck  was something from like a lethal weapon movie that was never made . . . and justin timberlake whining and spewing nonsense every time he talks  little cocky bastard . the only bright spot was a crazy dylan mcdermott doing his best  denzel from training day  impression  which was pretty entertaining .  br    br   oh yea so whats the movie about  eh  something about scandals involving the city edison  s fictional special unit police force called  f . r . a . t .  i swear i  m not making this stuff up  which was supposed to be a obvious play off of s . w . a . t . anyway little journalistic super singer boy justin timberflake smells something foul afoot after a murder involving  undercover cops from frat  and he goes scurrying off looking for a story  gaining his boss   freeman  trust along the way while they both unravel something even bigger and sinister than what they both thought . blah blah blah . its like a bootleg pelican brief meets a halfassed training day . the pacing was slow and off  the script was horrible  and the acting was extremely uninspired . it jumped everywhere without going anywhere . people get put in comas and you forget about them . everyone in this movie just didn  t think . damn what a stupid movie . its becoming harder to write any sort of review for it because the movie left my brain the second it ended . . . no lie basically  do not waste your time   ,0

i have never been one to shy away from saying that most action films just plain do nothing for me . most times they are blatant vehicles to blow stuff up  show off sexy models  and throw any semblance of reality or intelligence out the window . with that said  the bourne series has been fantastic . doug liman ushered in a new take on action by using a more cinema verite style  showing the fights in full force and making our super spy someone we can relate to emotionally as well as humanly . this is not the sci  fi absurdity that was bond  before they did an overhaul in the style of this series no less  . there was a lot to worry for when the bourne supremacy came out . with director paul greengrass taking over  what could have been a second  hand copy of the original ended up being an improvement in style and flair . the stakes were raised and the story was enhanced because of it . greengrass needs to be given a ton of credit for being able to keep up appearances with the latest installment  the bourne ultimatum . in what is an amazing conclusion to a top  notch trilogy  the action is brought to a new level and story and performance are never compromised .  br    br   once again  bourne is brought into the minds of the cia by false pretenses . someone has leaked information about the treadstone upgrade called blackbriar and once bourne is located trying to converse with the newswriter who broke the story  he is assumed to be the mole . only pamela landy  she who was on the case to find him in supremacy  knows that he can  t be the one . bourne  s motive has always been to stay clear of the government and live his life in peace . it has been the cia who keeps bringing him back into the open to wreak havoc on them . what ends up transpiring is that bourne wants to know the source as well to finally find out the truth of who he is and what made him into a killer . the film  then  becomes a chase against time and each other to find the source and see if the government can close the breach and tie off all loose ends  or if bourne can get his revenge on those who took his life from him .  br    br   in what is probably the simplest storyline of the series  with only one chase lasting the entirety of the story  it has possibly the biggest cast of characters and turning over of loyalties to expose the corruption that has been behind the full story progression . this is not a detriment at all  however  as it allows for more fights and car chases that work in full context to the plot . admission to this film is worth it for the apartment fight  between bourne and the cia  s second asset  alone . the chase jumping through windows in madrid is cool on its own  but when they finally meet up  we get a ten minute or so fight that is as invigorating to watch as any scene you  ll see . also  rather than using a massive car chase as a climatic set piece like in the first two films  we instead get around three small scale road races  just as intense  but staggered enough to never bog the action down into monotony .  br    br   after five years of waiting  we also find out the origin of our favorite operative with heart and feeling . by the end of the film we will find out what has been the cause of all the espionage and destruction that has taken place around him . no one could have done it better than matt damon . he has the physique and attitude to be believable in the action sequences  but also the range to pull off the moments of intelligence and cat and mouse correspondence with those against him . joan allen reprises her role with the same amount of dedication to her job  but also a bit more disenchantment for what is going on around her after how brian cox  s character  from the first two films  took matters into his own hands . needing a role in that mold  we are given a nice turn from david strathairn . like cox  he is working at the top of the food chain and answers to no one when making a decision . with as much trying to cover up any connections to his bosses of the blackbriar program as he is trying to do his duty to his country  you can never quite gauge what he will be capable of doing . even the little guys do a wonderful job  like paddy considine as the reporter who starts the leak at the center of everything  albert finney as a man from bourne  s past and possibly key to his origin  and edgar ramirez as one of the cia  s operatives sent to take bourne out . ramirez is a nice addition to the role that has been successfully played by clive owen  identity   karl urban  and martin csokas  supremacy  . he doesn  t talk much  if at all  but he has the look and robotic efficiency down pat and hopefully will get more roles to show what he can do post a nice turn in domino .  br    br   in the end  one has to applaud paul greengrass for continuing to exceed expectations and bring this series to a conclusion that builds on the success of its predecessors rather than destroy them . his skill at the close  up hand  held look is astonishing and has the same kinetic energy as tony scott  but without quite the seizure  inducing cuts . rather than feel like over  production  his use of hand  held enhances the environment and puts you directly into the action . let  s also credit cinematographer oliver wood  who shot all three bourne films . he was able to work with both directors and work his style into a nice harmony with them .  ,1
a delightful piece of cinema storytelling in a simple but effective way . cinema after all is a visual media and igor used its full potential . a young restless man boards a train with no destination in mind . in one of the compartments he meets with a girl . words are not exchanged but their laundry washing are and from there we are taken on a ride with other peculiar characters and situations . the two leads are perfectly cast as their unique features tell you a story that needs no words .  ,1

seriously  i mean very seriously  when i first started watching the show i thought it was good . but the plots just got worse . the storyline were either too boring or predictable . george isn  t always funny  he sometimes acts stupid . his jokes are overdone . his mom is the silliest character of the show . how can a mother treat her own son that way  okay if it was the daughter in law  but this was her own son . i give this show a     just because the first few shows were a little funny . the actors constance marie and masiela lusha do a great job . don  t know how these shows get to play for so long .  br    br   if you  re really bored like i was and have nothing else to watch  i  d suggest you watch this .  ,0

great western i hear you all say  brilliant first effort  well i  m not sure what film you all watched but it must have been a different one to the one i saw . great westerns or indeed good films of any genre have characters you can believe in and this film had none  the acting was poor to say the least and i couldn  t care less about any of the characters  making the whole film pointless . the story was too big for the makers and perhaps they should try their hand at making straight to tv low budget rubbish like you see on those  fact or fiction  programmes on sci  fi .  br    br   please  if you are looking for a good film  a great western or even just an enjoyable hour and a half  please look elsewhere .  ,0

anita and me seems to be little more than an excuse for meera syal  the author of the novel and screenplay  to air her prejudices  grievances and general antipathy towards the english . the general sentiment of indian superiority over the english in this film is foul .  br    br   the english people in this film are portrayed as overweight  violent  foul  mouthed  promiscuous  engaging in child neglect  stupid  uneducated  racist  ugly  eating poor food  and dim  witted   tellingly  only by turning to indian culture can the local priest be  redeemed  at the end of the film .  br    br   by contrast  the indian family are beautiful  clever  educated  can speak many languages  are caring and loving parents  and grammar  school fodder . the film is so insidiously prejudicial that i am astonished the bbc funded it at all . had it been the other way round  an english family in an indian community depicted this way  the film would have been seen as racist .  br    br   there were a few moments where my eyebrow shot so far up my forehead  i thought it would lodge in my hairline . first  the gossip scene between the women at the divali celebration   undertext the english are dirty and promiscuous   and the men   undertext english women are prostitutes . second  the meal with anita where neema  s family lie to her about cutlery   undertext the english are so stupid  you can make them do anything .  br    br   but the underlying contempt towards anything english   even english weddings are an object of scorn   is evident all the way through the film . the character of anita was drawn so appallingly   almost the fallen woman trope   that i finished the film feeling angry .  br    br   this is not a  bend it like beckham  where the humour is focused on loving exaggerations of a community  s behaviour and customs from somebody within that community  and is a film about two girls from different backgrounds coming together . instead  anita and me seems to convey that a form of cultural apartheid is inevitable  as the english are almost an version of the indian untouchable caste  and this is underscored by a thinly  veiled series of attacks upon the film  s  other  community the english .  br    br   i felt anita and me is a hate  filled  grievance  based piece of work . on that basis  the bbc should not have funded its production .  ,0
  midnight cowboy  was never a great movie to start with but it is a classic . you know it  s a classic the moment its insistent theme song   everybody  s talking  starts up on the soundtrack   actually not written for the film   and the way the camera introduces us to joe buck   naked and in the shower  . we had seen jon voight before but had never really noticed him but when he tells us he  s  one helluva stud  who  s to doubt him  this was a great performance that had iconic star status as well as a complete grasp of the character and if voight had never done anything else  his performance here would still be legendary . as it is voight has seldom disappointed on screen even a piece of ham as well cured as his performance in that glorious rubbish  anaconda  is a source of pleasure  .  br    br   the film became famous and infamous almost overnight . it was a crowd  pleaser   even with its downbeat ending   funny and sexy and recognizably  real    it was the tail  end of the sixties and all the characters rang true  . it was also the first  x  rated film to win the oscar as the year  s best picture . adapted   brilliantly   by waldo salt from a james leo herlihy novel it was probably the first main  stream commercial american movie to deal with  taboo  subjects such as homosexuality and drug  taking in a matter  of  fact manner . everyone is recognizably human  warts and all  and everyone is treated sympathetically . voight  s joe buck is an innocent abroad  a candide who comes to new york to seek his fortune as a hustler   a profession he sees as glamorous and not seedy he  s a cross between a gigolo and a social worker  . but when he himself is hustled by a scraggy  wormy little con  man called  ratso  rizzo   dustin hoffman  fresh from  the graduate  and he  s a revelation   he realizes that perhaps the reality is a little different from the pipe  dream .  br    br   essentially it  s a male love story   though totally platonic   between these two not so unlikely bedfellows . both totally alone  both totally needy each becomes the protector of the other   voight with his physical prowess  hoffman with his street  wise savvy  . they are misfits adrift from the mainstream  tolerant of their own peculiarities and the deviances of others . though  straight  voight isn  t beyond a homosexual encounter in a   nd street cinema with a boy even lonelier than himself .  the whole film posits a strangely  christian  attitude  .  br    br   it  s also magnificently acted . while voight and hoffman hold the screen throughout there are superb vignettes from the likes of brenda vaccaro and sylvia miles as well as john mcgiver  bob balaban and bernard hughes as sundry customers and hangers  on  beautifully delineated little character studies that seem to transcend acting altogether while john schlesinger  s direction gives the film the feel of a documentary as well as an alien  s totally detached eye  view of the american under  belly without rancor and without criticism . on second thoughts  maybe it is a great movie after all .  ,1
after coming off the first one you think the wayans brothers could come up with some new jokes . though i guess not . if the first one wasn  t bad enough this one is just so bad it hurts to watch . with all the actors they had in this film you think they could come up with something a little more clever . though they couldn  t  they had to take all the same raunchy  not funny jokes from the first one and somehow put it into this film thinking people would laugh at it again . though the thing is i didn  t laugh at it the first time . they tried to make these movies into parodies though they failed at every level . most of the time it  s just randomly inserted jokes  that are so disgusting and raunchy that it  s hard to watch it and enjoy it . then when they do try to do scenes that are movie parodies they just end up making a   minute recreation of the scene with maybe one joke within the entire scene . also for people saying that its not for the older and real young audience  well i fit into the age range that it  s supposed to be funny for . while people say that different people have different ideas of what is funny or not  if you do find this funny then you probably aren  t one of the more mature or intelligent people around . it doesn  t take that much skill to write that kind of a script  though if you do want a more clever and funnier movie go see the movie spaceballs . it  s a movie parody that  s actually good and well done and it didn  t have to use disgusting and raunchy jokes to make it funny either .  ,0
for me this movie was powerful . i don  t want to be a spoiler  but i had a friend years ago we were like brothers . this movie brought back some vivid memories .  br    br   for some reason  i couldn  t place my vote for this movie which would have been a   . i kept getting a message like  no votes have been placed . . . .  and yet i saw in the stats that there were . will try again tomorrow  monday  .  br    br   minor flaws i overlooked . it was the relationships between the characters that got me . beautifully acted and real situations . i  ve been in a couple of them .  br    br   a small gem of a movie . just like  spring forward  is another overlooked gem . i  m very glad movies like these are still being made about relationships between people  well written  sensitively unfolded with first  class acting and direction . after all  isn  t that what it  s all about   ,1
first of all  i liked very much the central idea of locating the   intruders    others in the fragile self  on various levels  mainly subconscious but sometimes more allegorical . in fact the intruders are omnipresent throughout the film  in the swiss  french border where the pretagonist leads secluded life in the his recurring daydream and nightmare inside his ailing body after heart transplantation . . . . in the last half of the film  he becomes intruder himself  returning in ancient french colony in the hope of atoning for the past .  br    br   the overall tone is bitter rather than pathetic  full of regrets and guilts  sense of failure being more or less dominant . this is a quite grim picture of an old age  ostensibly self  dependent but hopelessly void and lonely inside . the directer composes the images more to convey passing sensations of anxiety and desire than any explicit meanings . some of them are mesmerizing  not devoid of humor though  kind of absurdist play only somnambulist can visualize .  ,1
i agree with most if not all of the previous commenter  s tom  bighouseazyahoo . com  . the zatoichi series is a great character study combined with great sword fighting and excitement .  br    br   i have seen zatoichi            i believe   has not been released on zone   usa  . zatoichi the outlaw was disappointing . the story line was complicated  and seemed to be a hodgepodge of many previous zatoichi story lines . at one point  i was wondering if i was not seeing a remake of a previous zatoichi film .  br    br   this film was disappointing because it started to depend on effects  a head rolling  limbs severed  blood  and less on the nobility of the zatoichi character . all the previous films succeeded based on the storyline and action  and won a great following without having to resort to effects .  br    br   i am just hoping that the remaining zatoichi films do not follow the same trend . this is the first zatoichi film from his studio . i highly recommend all the previous zatoichi films   and recommend them .  ,0
i checked this movie out when it still had  votes and it said like  .  or something  but seriously this is a horrible movie . lets break it down . the first thing you notice about this movie is that it was filmed on a hand  held digital camera owned by a freshman at a community college . the next thing you  ll notice is that the actors  are all friends of said freshman  he probably met them at the pub the night before . third on the list you will notice that the musical editing is horrible  and they try to cram many songs into this movie  at   second intervals . . . also all digital editing is done on said freshman  s home pc . . . probably using windows movie maker . this movie was horrible . . . pretentious  had an undeniably bad script  and acting that followed suit . i wouldn  t recommend this movie to anyone i know  but i do sentence the writer and director to watch this movie in hell for an eternity .  ,0
my friend bought the movie for    its is not even  cent worth   because they wrote it was like american pie . but we would soon find out that there is a long way from american pie to that piece of crap . it is not even a comedy  its more like a really really really bad documentary . not only the story is bad  the picture and sound also sucks to . they put in some alcohol  chicks  dwarfs and drunken teens . and the result is a disaster . if you see this movie don  t buy it  rather spend your money on something else  and better . if you are gonna torture yourself  then don  t invite your friend  s  unless you hate really much and you want to get rid of them .  ,0
fritz lang  s german medieval saga continues in die nibelungen kriemhilds rache       . kriemhild  margarete schoen  wants to avenge her murdered husband  siegfried . her brother is too weak to bring the murdered  hagen  to justice . kriemhild marries etzel  the king of the huns  rudolf klein  rogge  . she gives birth to a child  and invites her brothers for a party . etzel and the other huns should kil hagen  but he is protected by his brothers . we see a huge battle of life and death begins  and she sets the whole place on fire . eventually hagen is dead  and so is kriemhild . these movies deal with great themes  such as revenge and undying love . sure we have later seen some better movies made of those topics  but this was one of the early ones .  ,1
anyone not aware of the     original british lion movie  the wicker man  would  no doubt  have left the cinema with the impression  poor  and  peurile  .  br    br   as a devotee of the original i left with the impression purely poor .  br    br   from the grim reality of haggle toothed inbreds drawing the force of law and order into a web of paganistic barbaric ritual on a remote scottish island  named summerisle  the original  to a near amazon  ic colony off the maine coast of the us  named summersisle  the remake hardly hits the spot .  br    br   this is  quite sadly  a case of what  could  have been a classic remake of a classic being tampered with to cater for a simple minded public . nothing more and nothing less .  br    br   gentlemen  or given the reworked context of the film  ladies involved . . . hang your heads in shame .  ,0
great actors  an oscar nominee actress  stunning scenery  good strong story line and more laughs than you can fit into my new handbag  and thats quite big  . this film was brilliant . it was beautifully acted in the more serious scenes and the funny moments were . . well  side splitting . i have never heard a cinema audience laugh so much  and tears were streaming down my cheeks during the  stoned ladies in the tea shop  scene . well done to the british film industry and to craig ferguson whose magic ingredients have made sure this is one of my favourite films of the year  if not of all time .  ,1
this movie raises a number of pressing questions in my mind . firstly  how has jennifer tilly managed to sustain a film acting career for all these years based on that ridiculous squeaky voice and the very limited range of hammy facial expressions she employs  secondly . . . what on earth were the people responsible for making this offensive and deeply repulsive film thinking of  and thirdly . . . given that there were people perverted enough to decide to make dreck like this  shouldn  t there have been someone in the system  the studio  the distributors  or somewhere  sane enough to prevent it actually getting completed and released . you really would have to search a very  very long way to turn up another movie as profoundly nasty as this . . . and it isn  t even billed as a horror movie  which  inasmuch as it can be seen as belonging to any legitimate film genre  it certainly is . the movie wallows from beginning to end in the sickest kind of madness  violence and abuse  and has essentially no redeeming features at all . i  m not actually advocating censorship  which i don  t believe in  . . . but i really can  t see how anybody could conceivably draw anything positive from watching a film like this .  ,0
in loving memory of david tomlinson             br    br   when i watched this movie for the first time i was  years old and i got fascinated by this story of witches in the  nd world war . the scene  which impressed me the most  was the fight between the nazi soldiers and the medieval army . it was exceptional to see this army without a body walk to fight the astonished singing their march . this movie is fantastic  from the trip to portobello road  which became to me the most fantastic place of london  to the journey to naboomboo . angela lansbury and david tomlinson are really a fantastic couple . she is always great  it seems the good aunt of a family and david with his always astonished face is her great co  protagonist . we  ll miss him a lot .  ,1
you ever get that itch to just kill an hour or two doing chores and watching a movie so bad it defies reason  well  out renting movies one weekend i see the box art for this one and see the t  rex . knowing full well that the dinosaur on the package was the t  rex from jurassic park  i knew i had to rent this just cause i was in the mood for a bad movie .  br    br   i was not disappointed in the least .  br    br   mad scientists  secret formulas  a company more concerned about its fortune and shareholders than lives  and of course  a big  poorly animated  sock  puppet t  rex . is it me our through out the movie was there scenes clearly spliced from other movies  not to mention the rex  s hungry is never satisfied . . . ever . how he has hungry is beyond me because he actually doesn  t have an throat  really if you look down his mouth when he roars  it  s solid . . . like a toy or something  . now  i like watching incredibly bad b  movies from time to time because it reminds me how much better a blockbuster movie is . this one was hilarious . i  m not even sure if this was supposed to be a thriller or a comedy  because there are scenes where  make no mistake  you will laugh .  br    br   do i blame the movie  s budget . . . yes  but the acting didn  t help either . ok  tony todd was actually pretty good  as for some of the female roles . . . when you cry shouldn  t  tears  come out  meh  i am not going to be angry at this movie  i knew what i was getting into and if you  re looking for a bad movie to watch with friends  here  s what i recommend watch this movie  then immediately watch jurassic park and then lost world back to back . you will be writing mr . spielberg thank you letters the next day .  ,0
in light of bad reviews  or car crashes  i feel possessed to get in gear and make a transmission to give merit where due  and do a service . i  m not sure people have license to say it was so bad  almost automatically .  br    br   it  s rare for a movie to have suspense . this movie maintained suspense it  s whole length  for me  despite any flaws that may be . how many films can say that  not even many big ones . because of the simple premise you don  t know if the people will get out of the life  threatening situation  which lasts the whole movie . yeh  the suspension was tight  and over some bumps the shocks did their work . it  s not just a tv movie  but an all  action movie there is no point where it stops  or deviates  or becomes talky . it would be hard to make a film like this  always on the road . only duel  or speed  are this that i recall . the best thing in them also was the constant tension .  br    br   acting is not bad the judge is as good as ever  and the others are .  br    br   script is good . but the jury is out as to whether it sometimes may be  or seem to be  a little awry . what seems unrealistic is not necessarily so . your first judgments are not always right  but i think the lead actor  s was right in being in this movie .  br    br   stunts are mostly terrific  especially for a tv movie . their only failing may be the noticeable  and again  apparent  slow speed . but we all know how deceivingly slow grand prix cars can look .  br    br   i liked that the beginning said   inspired by a true story .  so you are not going to go how much is true  you know just the basis is . the usual  based on a true story  makes me think it should mostly be true . but maybe that  s my error .  br    br   how to save them good idea of the reviewer to suggest a tow truck to lift the back wheels up . just a few inches would do . a stunt driver could do that at    mph . odd that they didn  t call a car expert  or auto electrician or mechanic  to see if there  s a way .  br    br   i hope this review has put in reverse that this film is a disaster . or at least neutral . and help it become a runaway success .  br    br   pic quality is a little soft for a dvd .  br    br   spoiler they would have been winched out after the baby was  but strangely that life  saving idea was cleverly dealt with in some joking conversation to fade it out . i guess we know why . end of movie . suspension of disbelief went out the top window with the baby .  ,1
brilliant over  acting by lesley ann warren . best dramatic hobo lady i have ever seen  and love scenes in clothes warehouse are second to none . the corn on face is a classic  as good as anything in blazing saddles . the take on lawyers is also superb . after being accused of being a turncoat  selling out his boss  and being dishonest the lawyer of pepto bolt shrugs indifferently  i  m a lawyer  he says . three funny words . jeffrey tambor  a favorite from the later larry sanders show  is fantastic here too as a mad millionaire who wants to crush the ghetto . his character is more malevolent than usual . the hospital scene  and the scene where the homeless invade a demolition site  are all  time classics . look for the legs scene and the two big diggers fighting  one bleeds  . this movie gets better each time i see it  which is quite often  .  ,1

i happened to borrow this movie from a friend knowing nothing about it  and it turned out to be an outstanding documentary about a journey on an ancient vessel across vast expanses of the ocean . thor heyerdahl had developed a theory that the ancient incas in peru managed to travel thousands of miles across the ocean to polynesia  based on certain relics that are found in both places  certain types of ancient sea  going vessels that we know they had available  analysis of ocean and wind currents  and the knowledge that the incas did  in fact  travel in some undetermined amount at sea .  br    br   in order to test his hypothesis  heyerdahl and his crew construct a vessel as closely as possible to what the ancient incas had available  using only balsa wood and other materials available at the time  and set out from lima  peru  s capital  to try to reach the islands of polynesia  some      miles away .  br    br   his theory  like so much about ancient history  is impossible to prove with     certainty  but the coverage of their journey provides for strong support that he is right . the film is really little more than narration of footage taken during the     day expedition  but it is a very detailed description of what it was like and the trials and tribulations that they faced . i often wish that academy award winning documentaries were easier to find  and this one from more than   years ago is still as interesting and informative as i am sure it was when it was first released .  ,1
it  s rare  nowadays  to find a romantic comedy that isn  t incredibly disgusting in short doses throughout the entire movie  eg . big fat greek wedding me  myself  irene  . there were only a couple of unnecessarily demented jokes in this movie  nothing unpalatably profane . all around  it was a cute movie with likable characters . i thought the ending was a little abrupt . it feels like they should have ended it at the world series for a real bang up finish . the acting left a little to be desired  but was made up for by the pace of the story . if i  d known it was a farrelly brothers movie i would have assumed it to be a stomach turning piece of garbage and not watched it  but it seems that even they are capable of accidentally making an okay movie . good for them  i hope they pull their heads out the rest of the way and start consistently making good films .  ,1
  a christmas story  is one of many people  s all  time most beloved films . acs was able to take the viewer to a time and a place in such a way that very few films ever have . it had a sweetness and goodwill to it that is rare .  br    br   so i awaited  and awaited  its sequel   it runs in the family  . the film was almost released a couple of times  only to be pulled at the last minute . when it finally came out  iritf was  and is  i guess  a total failure .  br    br   the sets and cinematography were just fine  but the directing totally  completely missed the mark . the film was nothing more than a cash  flow formula of lazy casting  lazy writing  and disconnected acting .  br    br   the narrator  jean shepard  who was one of america  s great humorists and story  tellers  forced upon us a false reprise of the warm wit he used in acs . he over  emoted  and why he did that i  ll never know . he somehow managed to become an annoying  overwrought parody of himself .  br    br   the writing and acting in iritf is inauthentic and forced . the actors may have seen acs  but whatever wit and nuance that was in acs mustn  t have registered at all on any of them . the acting was embarrassingly slapstick and bereft of any of shepard  s dry humor .  br    br   acs will always be a real treasure  but to call iritf a sequel is to insult all of the fans of jean shepard and acs .  ,0
ok  anyone who could honestly say that this movie was great or even good is either delusional or knows the director  writer and producers and is trying to boost the buzz on this film . i watched the movie because a friend of mine worked on it and it was horrible . i  m an actress and have worked in the industry for a while now on big films and even independents and this movie bored me to tears . the reason i  m being so harsh is because this film was clearly a different take on  of mice and men  and they should sue because it is such a horrible rip  off of the story . in an industry where hollywood seems to be creatively bankrupt . . . for someone to take a classic book and film  of mice and men  and destroy it with a new spin bugs me so much . the actors  the accents  the dialog and the direction were amateurish and the writing was dismal . i mean if your going to take a new spin on an existing story make sure its just as good or better than the original to make the new spin justified . did not like this movie at all .  ,0
but this movie was a bore . the history part was fine but the musical part was not . not one song i cared about and no soundtrack to be heard .  br    br   if sweet jesus  was suppose to be comic relief it never work . if john adams was suppose to be the obnoxious annoying one  the rest of them were trying to overthrow him in every scene .  br    br   hancock and jefferson were the only bearable characters in the whole movie .  br    br   the historical quotes and the debate about slavery in their historical context were interesting enough but not enough to overcome the lack of music in a musical .  br    br   shouldn  t you be humming the songs after a musical  except for a few chirps  nothing else was worth the breath .  ,0
it was     pm last night at my friend  s camping trailer and we were so hyped to watch south park  a new episode  . the thing is  in my country  south park airs at      pm and we decided to kill time by watching the show now airing  father of the pride . i  ll start by saying that i have only watched to episodes . the first time i watched it  i found it unfunny and crude for nothing  so i thought   holy sht  i have a football game early tomorrow  so i have to stop watching stupid cartoons   . but yesterday  i tried to give father of the pride a second chance . i find that it  s a complete rip  off of the simpsons  only replacing yellow human characters by lions instead .  br    br   the second thing is i wonder why it got it  s tv    rating . i find the simpsons a lot more vulgar  and the only real vulgarity in this show is a few homosexual  unfunny  jokes . the simpsons is also a lot more violent  halloween specials  and crude . i also heard that the creator of the series has also directed shrek   well i  ve got news for him shrek  was way better and i think he stayed too much in the family thematic . however  i must admit that father of the pride did make me smile  even burst out laughing once  three or four times .  br    br   all in all  i don  t mind father of the pride . i don  t hate it  but i don  t like either . i  ve seen way better from   the simpsons   .  br    br    .      ,0

this first  rate western tale of the gold rush brings great excitement  romance  and james stewart to the screen .  the far country  is the only one out of all five stewart  mann westerns that is often overlooked . stewart  yet again  puts a new look on the ever  present personalities he had in the five stewart  mann westerns . jeff webster  stewart  is uncaring  always looking out for himself  which is why he is so surprised when people are nice and kindly to him . ironically  he does wear a bell on his saddle that he will not ride without . this displays that he might just care for one person  his sidekick  ben tatum  played by walter brennan  since tatum is the one that gave it to him . mann  yet again  puts a new look on the ever present personalities he put into the five stewart  mann westerns . he displays violence  excitement  plot twists  romance  and corruption . the story is that jeff and ben  through a series of events  wind up in the get rich quick town of dawson  along with gold partners calvet and flippen  and no  good but beautiful roman and her hired men . they are unable to leave  because crooked sheriff mr . gannon  mcintire  and his  deputies  will hang them  since the only way out is through skagway  which is gannon  s town . but  eventually  mcintire comes to them  but not to collect stewart and  or his fine that he supposedly owes to the government . what is mcintire there for  he is there to cheat miners out of their claims and money . people are killed . a sheriff for dawson is considered needed  and calvet elects stewart because he is good with a gun . stewart  however  refuses the job  because he plans to get all the gold he can  and then pull out . he also refuses it because he does not like to help people  since law and order always gets somebody killed . so  flippen is elected instead . a miner is killed because he tries to stand up to one of gannon  s men  a purely evil  mustachioed fancy gunman named madden  who carries two guns  played by wilke . flippen attempts to arrest madden and see that justice be done  but he cannot stand up to him  so he becomes the town drunk . a man named yukon replaces flippen . stewart and tatum start to pull out  but are ambushed by gannon  s men . tatum is killed  and stewart is wounded . stewart finally realizes that he must do something  or gannon will take over dawson  set up his own rules  and it will become his town  just like skagway . the audience also realizes what stewart must do . another thing that the audience realizes is that stewart is the only thing that stands between the townspeople and gannon . if stewart leaves  gannon would take over the town . if stewart stays and keeps on not doing anything about it  the townspeople will be killed one by one mercilessly and uselessly . this is where a great scene occurs . stewart walks into his cabin . he has a sling on his arm . for a few seconds  his gun  in the gunbelt  is hanging on a post beside his bed  the gun is close up  stewart is in the background  just inside the door . he stares at it for a few seconds . he tosses the sling away . the sling lands on the back of a chair  and falls to the floor . this is symbolic  because he is throwing away his old life  which consisted of not caring about anybody but himself . he comes into his new life  of helping people when they need help . what ends the film is a guns  blazing  furious show of good against evil  and a genuinely feel  good feeling that everything will be alright .  ,1
spoilers alert  br    br   homeward bound the incredible journey is an important film from my life because it  s the first film i remember seeing in the cinema of my home town as a   year old scamp . the story is based on the sheila burnford novel  and is a reason why it  s not possible to write this one off as a brainless lassie clone .  br    br   the basic story two dogs and a cat happily live in the seaver family when the new husband to the mother of the three children  gets a job in the city and they have to temporarily move into inner san francisco while the animals are sent to a ranch to live for a couple of months . the bonds between the animals and the children they watch out for are especially strong  and shadow the golden retriever and sassy the himalayan cat are heartbroken as the children are  though the young and happy  go  lucky american bulldog known as chance is a little less concerned and somewhat cynical  due in part to his voice  over explaining his being abandoned as a pup  picked up to an animal shelter  and being bought by the family   though his growth as a character during the story provides much of the important storytelling .  br    br   the three pets escape the ranch and head off into the wide and dangerous wilderness  fantastic wilderness settings by the way   driven on by shadow  s instincts of direction . they meet several perils along the way  hoping to make it home  while the family and the ranch hosts are suddenly concerned about the animal disappearance . there are funny moments all the way through  great dialogue between the three animals and hilarious lines  see  memorable quotes   and a touching comradeship that grows between the main characters during the course of the storytelling  punctuated by moments of sadness  such as when sassy  s arrogance of trying to cross a river without getting wet causes her to fall in the river and get washed down a waterfall  leaves a moment of loss that is felt deeply by the viewers  .  br    br   somehow though  i fail to see what the inclusion of saving the girl lost in the wilderness adds to the story and the journey they take . somehow  it seems a little unnecessary as part of the story .  br    br   the ending cranks the stakes higher when shadow falls into a pit in a trainyard and having hurt his leg  finds it hard to get out and gives up  exhausted  followed by chance climbing in with him to persuade him to climb out  telling him how important he is to him and how he  s pushed them this far so he shouldn  t throw it all away so easily .  br    br   the way that this scene  brilliantly done  isn  t concluded leaves an ambiguity that carries on into the final scene when chance and sassy return home  but shadow is nowhere to be seen . then just as all seems lost  he slowly appears  and is reunited with the family . chance  s conclusion at the end speaks of the comradeship that has developed between he and his fellows on the journey  and the realisation to what home really is from his long journey to get there  leaves a fine epilogue to demonstrate how much his character has grown  but also how the other two have as well . hang on a second  i think i  m going to cry . . .  br    br   anyway  i haven  t read sheila burnford  s book  so i don  t pretend to know where the differences between book and film lie . but this is a film that all the family can watch  and while the tots will love the talking animals  older viewers will understand the plot line better  as i found when i watched the film again after several years without seeing it  . this film is a masterpiece in cinema  and i suggest that if you haven  t seen it you go out and get it   br    br   and please avoid the sequel  see my review for homeward bound ii    ,1
i was very disappointed with this film . i expected more of a thelma and louise female  buddy crime movie . instead  the women prison escapees in this flick  had no sense of loyalty to one another . they were an extremely vulgar pack of hyenas  who beat each other up  double  crossed each other  and even committed lesbian rape against other women in the film .  br    br   instead of being shrewed thieves  who stuck together to plan their escape and find the hidden stash of money  the women escapees were too selfish and vicious  to trust each other for long . these women weren  t liberated in a positive sense . they just ended up being a bunch of loose  cannons  incapable of respect for themselves  or each other . if you like   s female crime caper films  skip this bomb  and see the great texas dynamite chase  which stars claudia jennings and jocelyn jones .  ,0
comedies often have the unfortunate reputation of having little real depth . arms and the man  proves that notion to be false . shaw  s play is full of comedic drama  combining an entertaining plot with true philosophical depth .  br    br   on one level  arms and the man is a successful  and somewhat unique  romantic comedy . the young  melodramatic  and superficial raina comes from a military family deeply involved in a war her fianc and her father are both military officers . she is shocked  one night by the arrival of an enemy soldier . she rescues him  knowing that she  ll have to keep the incident a secret from her family forever  and the soldier eventually leaves . of course  once the war is over  that soldier comes back  forcing each of the primary characters to reevaluate their values and their relationships .  br    br   it is quite interesting how shaw layers meaning within the rather standard comedic plot . shaw manages to comment on class constructs  on the absurdity of war  and even on the nature of love . and  of course  he does this with the shavian wit and within a satisfying plot . there is so much here to think about that i think a lot can be missed in a single viewing . arms and the man is excellent comedic theater and is definitely one of shaw  s best works .  br    br    arms and the man  is both an amusing and thought  provoking movie that retains its relevance even today  more than a century after it was first conceived . shaw mocks at the popular theories on war and love and combines a military satire with a taunt on love and family structure . the play has flashing wit  buoyant humor and bitter sarcasms . a good example of shaw  s dialog is the statement by captain bluntschli to serguis  i  m a professional soldier i fight when i have to  and am very glad to get out of it when i haven  t to . you  re only an amateur you think fighting is an amusement  . indeed as a swiss hotel  keeper  s son  bluntschli had no reason to be involved in war and it is in this absurdity that shaw questions patriotic sentiments . shaw explores the whole concept of war and the military from both sides of the struggle and in the end shows that the feelings in both camps are not that different .  br    br   the dialog and sarcasm used towards the common notions of life are entangled with a gentle assurance of the movement of the story towards a fairytale ending . the end where all characters are rendered happy and lovers change and love shifts is what underlines the essence of this drama as a comedy . this is a movie that sustains its image of possessing a universal appeal and is still appropriate today when the concepts of war and patriotism and love and marriage have changed dramatically . shaw  s  arms and the man  should maintain its relevance as long as there is love and war .  ,1
do not see this movie if you value your mind . at the end of our collective viewing  me and my friends estimated that we each lost   of our brains during its course . the only person involved with its making that was not clinically insane was the set designer .  br    br   most movies leave a bad taste in your mouth . i realize now that instead of a feeling of revulsion  this movie has bred a deep hatred within me . i hate this movie so very  very much .  br    br   some might say this movie is not meant to be taken seriously . if only it didn  t take itself seriously . but it does . the plot is a warmed over version of blade runner  esque universe melded with the cheap rubber suits so prevalent in bad dinosaur movies . the dialogue is not only puerile and meaningless but often literally painful . whoopee goldberg isn  t even trying  but george newbern as the voice of theodore rex is like fingernails on the soul . and whether its juliet landua with her off again on again british accent or richard roundtree  aka shaft  as the blustering commissioner  you will sink into an ever increasing sense of incredulity and disillusionment .  br    br   i recommend this movie only to anyone who wishes to see the depths of stupidity to which mankind may fall .  ,0
i stole this movie when i was a freshmen in college . i  ve tried to watch it three times  the second two because friends wanted to see it .  sweet  adam sandler  i  ve never heard of this movie  but since he  s so funny its gotta be funny .  wrong  i can  t make myself watch this pile of crap after the dream boxing match  insult war  where burning the guy with a good zinger causes your opponent physical pain . you would think that terrible comedy hurting you is ridiculous  but after watching this you  ll know its true . this movie isn  t worth the price i paid for it . i  ve watched a ton of steven segal movies  and i  ve even watched crossroads twice . . . but i still couldn  t watch this .  ,0
i don  t believe there has ever been a more evil or wicked television program to air in the united states as the    club . they are today  s equivalent to the ku klux klan of the   th century . their hatred of all that is good and sweet and human and pure is beyond all ability to understand . their daily constant attacks upon millions and millions of americans  as well as billions of humans the world over  who don  t happen to share their bigoted  cruel  monstrous  and utterly insane view of humanity is beyond anything television has ever seen . the lies they spout and the ridiculous lies they try to pass off as truth  such as the idea of  life after death  or  god  or  sin  or  the devil  is so preposterous that they actually seem mentally ill  so lost are they in their fantasy . sane people know that religion is a drug and shouldn  t let themselves get addicted to that type of fantasy . however  the    club is in a class by itself . they are truly a cult . while i believe in freedom of speech  they way they spread hatred  lies  disinformation  and such fantastic ideas is beyond all limits . i hope that one day the american psychiatric association will finally take up the study of those people who delude themselves in this way  people who let themselves sink so deeply into the fantasy land of religion that they no longer have any real concept of reality at all . treatment for such afflicted individuals is sorely needed in this country  as so many people have completely lost their minds to the fantasy of religion . the    club though  is even more horrible as it rises to the legal definition of  cult  but due to the    club  s vast wealth  conned daily from the millions of americans locked in their deceitful grip  they are above the law in this country . for those of you who have seen the movie  the matrix  you know that movie was a metaphor for religion on earth the evil ones who are at the top of each of the religions who drain the ones they have trapped and cruelly abuse for their own selfish purposes  and those millions who are held in a death sleep and slowly being drained of their life force represent those many people who belong to religions and who have lost all ability to perceive what is really going on around them .  br    br   in less civil times  the good townsfolk would have run such monsters as those associated with the    club out of town with torches and pitchforks . but in today  s world where people have lost all choice in their choices of television that is presented to them  we have no way to rid ourselves of the    club plague .  br    br   the television ratings system and the  v  chip on tv  s should also have a rating called  r  for religion  so that rational people and concerned parents could easily screen such vile intellectual and brutal emotional rape  such as presented by the    club every day all over our country  from themselves and their children .  ,0
i haven  t liked many tv shows post      but that   s show is great . never seeing it during it  s first run  thinking a gimmicky period piece  i was wrong  i started watching in reruns and the more i watched  the more i liked  now  it is the only show premiering post      that i watch regularly .  br    br   although that   s show mimics some of the styles  attitudes  music  and tastes of the   s  it does not mire itself in that decade by going overboard with the references and look of the   s . it contains so much funny  witty  biting dialogue that is delivered with confidence and certainty by its main cast that it overcomes any   s clichs by just being humorous . the humor is what keeps the show eternally watchable .  br    br   although a hilarious sitcom  no matter what time period  the uniqueness of mocking the   s does work in its favor as it gives the show a signature identity . but its the focus on universal issues  family problems  teen angst  marital issues  peer pressure   dealing with all of them with comic aplomb  that gives the show a mass appeal .  br    br   the show  s center is one eric forman  played to absolute comic perfection by future superstar topher grace  . eric is a super  skinny  geeky  looking  non  athletic teen and still comes off as super  cool due to grace  s brilliant self  deprecation of the character . eric has  friends donna  hyde  kelso  jackie  and fez  played respectively in hilarious fashion by laura prepon  danny masterson  ashton kutcher  mila kunis  and wilmer valderama  . we get to see life in point place  wisconsin through the eyes of these  teens and boy do we get a lot to see  donna  a forward  thinking feminist  is the object of eric  s affection and these  have the core relationship of the show . they become a couple pretty soon after the show starts and they are never a boring couple . most of the shows eps end with them having a meaningful conversation about them and their future and it works as a great insightful bookend  which works as a perfect counter to the prior hilarity . hyde is eric  s best friend and soon moves in with the formans when his mother abandons him hyde is the mellow  zen  cool one of the group and just sits back  observes  and makes fun of his fellow friends with easygoing aplomb . kelso is the dumb one of the group and kutcher plays it the absolute hilt  displaying amazing physical comedy as well as telling some of the most absurdly hilarious ideas and stories ever  jackie  who starts out as kelso  s girlfriend  is a verbose  self  absorbed debutante cheerleader and is at first only accepted as part of the group b  c of kelso  but she manages to ingratiate herself to the point where they all have to accept her  and finally  fez  fez is the foreign exchange student from some unknown country  we never know exactly where  and he is a scene  stealer   i said good day    you son of a btch   valderama is only sporting a foreign accent here as he hasn  t one in reality and he is always in character and creates one of the most unique characters i have ever seen . his scene  stealing moments often help make the show for me .  br    br   the show constantly takes us into the minds and thoughts of these characters through engaging fantasy scenes of how they would like or imagine things to be . the gang repeatedly gets into trouble  most of it on purpose  . they constantly play gags on the point place residents as well as each other . they hang out most of the time in eric  s basement plotting  pontificating  or just plain playing around .  br    br   also figuring prominently in the show are eric  s parents  the menacing  commie  hating red and the lovable  happy  go  lucky kitty  played memorably by kurtwood smith and debra jo rupp  . these  adults give the show a much  needed mature point  of  view and constantly berate and advise the  ne  er do  wells . red and kitty are ably supported by donna  s parents  the buffoonish bob  played wonderfully for the full run by don stark  and blonde bimbo daft midge  the super  sexy tanya roberts  who was on the show for about half it  s run  . additionally  for  full seasons  eric  s sister from hell laurie  played brilliantly by the wickedly sexy farrah  fawcett lookalike lisa robin kelly  was a major refreshing relief to counter the shenanigans of the main  and to be the thorn in eric and her parents  sides  kelly came back as a guest character for a few season  eps . but  unfortunately  kelly  s personal problems led to her being replaced by a terrible new actress in season  . the newbie didn  t last  thankfully  and was gone after a few season  eps   br    br   sadly  at the end of season   topher grace  eric  and early in season   ashton kutcher  kelso  left the show and it never recovered as season  turned out to be it  s last . grace and kutcher returned for the series finale  though  giving the show a satisfying end .  br    br   a lot of great supporting and cameo characters would help keep the show fresh through added nostalgia and humor . top notch supporting players were eternally high leo  played to the hilt by tommy chong   pastor dave  roy  the terrific comic jim gaffigan   big rhonda  mitch  earl  etc . they also got legends marion ross  happy days  and betty white  the mary tyler moore show  to play red and kitty  s mothers  respectively . many celebrity cameos from the   s made appearances as well  from shirley jones  partridge family  to pamela sue martin  nancy drew  to charo to ted nugent to k . i . s . s  it goes on and on   br    br   with great nostalgic   s homages and references  hilarious dialogue and delivery and a nonsensical  take  no  prisoners style of comedic storytelling  that   s show is a television classic   ,1
season after season  the players or characters in this show appear to be people who you  d absolutely love to hate . is this show rigged to be that or were they chosen for the same  each episode vilifies one single person specifically and he ends up getting killed off . you enjoy seeing them get screwed although its totally wrong and sick . you enjoy seeing them screwing others  getting screwed themselves  playing dirty  getting it back  escaping and finally getting kicked out by trump . the amount of tears also seems to be increasing by the season .  br    br   the rewards which attempt to compensate for past humiliation and suffering are also heavily reduced . in the newer seasons  its like  you get to meet xyx who  ll lecture you about uvw  . . like who freaking cares  the characters are so hateable  collectively and individually  that you wonder if they  re paid actors  the only sane one gets to win .  br    br   watch with caution and maintain a conscience . those are your fellow human beings in the firing line .  ,1
as the maker of  this darkness   i admit we neglected  very important acknowledgments in our end credits . the omissions were over  sights that could not be corrected once committed  nor did the parties involved    who saw the movie    mention it at the time . on behalf of the excellent cast and crew of the film  i extend them an apology . obviously  some criticisms posted here are harsh in light of their credit being accidentally . our production values were negligible and our  special effects  were quite special indeed  but the plot is very strong and the cinematography by john mcleod is superb . we hope you  the reader  enjoy  this darkness  and the efforts of those who worked their butts off for free . thank you  dylan o  leary  director .  ,1
jeez  only in the    s . . . antonio margheriti brings us this quirky hybrid of spaghetti western and kung fu flick evolving around a treasure  hunt . the spices of this trashy co  production between shaw brothers and an italian one  off company include humorous storytelling  off  the  wall happenings and some very tame ta . extra campy moments are being served by lee van cleef  s obnoxious wig  leather  clad bible  thumping psycho gunman yancey hobbitt  loveably hammed up by julian ugarte  the man who should  ve done way more obscure european genre productions than he did   wanna  be  witty dialogue  hilarious background music and completely laughable sound effects accompanying various little events  especially every jump made by lo lieh  .  br    br   while this little piece of action falls fare and square into the turkey territory  it  s great to see van cleef and lo lieh on the same screen  and you can  t deny the charisma of this duo . don  t expect too much  and you  ll get plenty out of it .  br    br   this is my truth . what is yours   ,0

titanic has to be one of my all  time favorite movies . it has its problems  what movies don  t  but still  it  s enjoyable .  br    br   when i stumble across someone who asks me why i like titanic  i suppose my first reaction is  wait a minute  you don  t   i know so many people who don  t like this movie  and i  m not saying i don  t see why .  the love story is too cheesy  well  yes but isn  t it enjoyable and moving  all right  the love story between jack and rose is very unrealistic  everyone knows that love like this doesn  t actually exist . but this is a movie  doesn  t everyone enjoy watching a beautiful story that lets us slip slightly into fantasy for a while  the next complaint  dicaprio and winslet are terrible actors . well  ok  in this movie  i agree that they do not perform to their full potentials . however i think it  s unfair to say that they are terrible actors . i personally think they are both very talented actors who unfortunately are very famous for a movie that they are not amazing in . but the roles they are given are simple  and the characters seem real enough that you can care about them quite a bit  but i agree with many people that they did not do as well as could have been expected .  br    br   and finally  if one is going to complain that they don  t like this movie because they hate romance  or because they hate history  or tragic movies  then i  m sorry but why on earth did they go and see a movie that is so clearly all of these things . it  s like people who complain the dark knight is a bad movie because they hate action movies . simply for being a movie  not because you dislike the genre  this is a good movie .  br    br   well deserving of its oscars  in particular  best cinematography  which i find to be the best i  ve ever seen in a movie save maybe the lord of the rings trilogy .  br    br   i know some of the writing fails  such as the constant screaming of each other  s names throughout the movie . the flashback portion of the story can be quite weak at times  but overall it  s an amazing achievement in making the titanic look so real  and the sinking feel so epic .  br    br   i understand why a lot of people dislike this movie  but for the most part it boils down to them disliking the fundamental idea  such as it being a love story  rather than them thinking the movie in and of itself is poorly constructed .  br    br   i can tell you that i have read more than five books about the titanic  including memoirs form the day it happened  and this movie is extremely historically accurate save just a few faults . the only main ones i can find is that the piping should be threaded copper  not steel  and the iceberg looks fairly unrealistic as is the scene where they hit it .  br    br   i give this movie       not because i like romance movies  but simply because it  s an outstanding cinematic achievement  that leaves one feeling horrified by the realistic adaptation of events .  ,1
this is a great movie for all generation x  ers . what a different world the america of     was compared to our psychotic   st century . you can get a sense of what an     america gone by was like by watching this movie . i found that the clothing and the car styles brought back to me fond memories of a much better country than we have now . just think . . . back then there were only  or  tv stations to choose from . there was no aids  muslim terrorists  road rage      bird flu  freeway snipers  etc  etc . the vietnam war was just over . there will still be  years before star wars comes out . the personal computer and internet would still be   years away .  br    br   when this movie first came out the producers had to market the film themselves as no other film company wanted it . so it began touring small protestant churches around the country being shown on movie projectors  this was the days before vcrs of course  . the pastor of a church who would would be interested in showing a thief in the night to his congregation would obtain a copy of the film . then he would set up a evening to show it in the church meeting area or lunch room . members of the congregation would invite  unsaved  friends and family members and it would be a social event of the week .  br    br   if you can get past the limited production values of the film and just watch it for its nostalgic value  then i think you will enjoy the film more . of course i am speaking as a gen xer .  br    br   if i had a time machine i would go back to     and say goodbye to the   st century cesspool we have now .  ,1
okay  let  s not get confused here . if this is a sequel to a remake of an original horror classic  does that mean it also automatically is a remake of the original horror classic  s sequel  here  s to hoping that  s not a general rule  as wes craven  s own sequel to the original  the hills have eyes   released somewhere during the mid     s  is easily one of the worst and absolute most redundant horror movies ever made . part two didn  t have an actual plot and re  used footage of the original only to further exploit the success of the genuinely gritty and petrifying premise . craven also wanted us to believe even dogs suffer from flashbacks and painful memories  as the loyal german shepard of the carter family re  experienced his bloody fight with one of the mountain hillbillies . there were quite a bit of alarming signs indicating us that this sequel would be a horrendous failure as well . the remake came out barely one year ago and here  s the sequel already  the incredible speed of its release righteously causes you to question the quality of the script . don  t they need a little more time if they want to come up with a film that should be scary  menacing and disturbing  with his excellent film  alexandre aja nearly single  handedly altered the general opinion about horror remakes  as he had the courage and intellect of changing essential elements in the plot and adding more nauseating gore than anyone could ever had hoped for . also  aja is quite a talented young director and made himself noticed with his french instant cult classic  high tension   but who is this new director  aja  s  the hills have eyes  was an unexpected hit  appreciated by both experienced and older generations of horror fans as well as the younger and over  enthusiast target groups . it  s a really good film and  even though an avalanche of new sequels and clones will be inevitable  it  s highly unlikely that one of them will ever equal the surprising quality level of aja  s smashing hit . bearing all this in mind  plus a rather large dose of personal skepticism  i must admit this rushed sequel really isn  t as awful as anticipated . the screenplay is routine and clichd horror fodder  introducing a fairly large number of characters with few or even no backbone and tastelessly depicting how they get slaughtered by traditionally repulsive  looking freaks . after the events of the first film  the us army has set up a camp in the middle of the new mexican desert to investigate the effects of the nuclear tests  which took place there in the    s and    s . for the horribly mutated survivors of the miner  s community that stayed there during the radioactive testing  the scientists and researchers form a tasty starter until the main course of incompetent soldiers arrives by truck . they are just supposed to drop off food and supplies but encounter their ultimate military training exercise when faced with the relentless humanoids that live inside the remainders of the mines .  br    br   this basically is just another by  the  numbers slasher with dumb characters who are  even after losing several of their friends already  still stupid enough to separate themselves from the group and act like easy targets to kill . it  s also very easy to point out which ones will make it out of this adventure alive  especially when one of the soldiers is against all types of violence and another one continuously stares at video images of her cute   year  old son .  the hills have eyes ii  completely lacks  as to be expected  originality  logic and plausible situations . the mutated miners aren  t nearly as menacing as their colleagues in part one  mainly because they aren  t organized this time and only just behave like drooling and sex  hungry prototype monsters . since you don  t care for the amateur g . i . joe  heroes  and definitely don  t feel any sympathy for the eyes in the hills  this film is a whole lot less compelling and involving than last year  s original . most peculiarly  this second film isn  t nearly as violent and gory as the first  sequels usually compensate the lack of suspense and the absence of surprise  twists with extra bloodshed and more graphic killing sequences  but the action in this sequel is really tame compared to the sick footage featuring in its predecessor . there are a handful of scenes to satisfy the bloodthirsty horror fanatics  mainly showing soldiers falling down cliffs or getting shot by their own guns  but there sadly aren  t any outrageous pick  axe battles or virulent dog attacks . what a shame  what  s the point of a sequel if it even fails to surpass the level of grossness and  or gratuitous filth of the original  luckily enough the film is never boring or unnecessarily sentimental  and you  ll have the most fun spotting all the things that don  t make the slightest bit of sense  for example  wallets falling out of people  s bloodied heads  women without any muscle power cast as tough  ass soldiers and  my personal favorite  assigning the one soldier with a speaking disability to operate the radio communications .  ,0
there were some great moments of reality in there depicting modern day life  not only in japan  but everywhere  . it shows how stifling ones culture can be  and wanting to break out of the mold its created for you .  br    br   the dancing was just a vehicle for saying  do what you love even if its against the norm  . rather billy elliot like i would say . i enjoyed that film as well .  br    br   the humour was well timed  and the touching moments felt so real  you could feel the awkwardness between sugiyama and his wife  the tantrums in the dance hall . i loved aoki  him and that wig and his excessiveness on the dance floor made me simply howl   br    br   the actors all did a wonderful job  the story was well written . i watched it a second time and caught some little nuances that i missed on the first viewing . good entertainment   ,1
really  when it comes down to it  this movie is just not funny . josh kornbluth is the antithesis of funny  and yet he thinks he  s hilarious . the plot about mailing the   letters was fine at first  until josh  s  look at me  i  m wacky  approach began infesting each and every scene . the judas priest joke may have been the least funny thing i have ever been privy to  and that is saying quite a bit  since it does have stiff competition from all the other jokes in the movie . and as for the incredible overuse of the pixies   debaser   i have just one thing to say what did the pixies ever do to deserve a fate like this  what did anyone do to josh kornbluth to cause him to write  direct  produce  star in such a terrible movie   ,0
it is a great movie if you have ever named your cars or are really into old  fast  or exotic cars . it has a plot and a lot of action . the car scenes are great except for the totally fake car jump scene . all of the other scenes are great . i really enjoyed it and i hope everyone else does as well .  ,1

man  what the hell were the people who made this film on  and more importantly where can i get some  the opening scene sets the tone for the film a woman writhing naked in a circle of fire  transforming into a werewolf . and this is no rick baker  american werewolf  transformation  folks . we  re talking some of the worst makeup ever captured on film here . i can just imagine some stoned italian spreading glue on naked annik borel  who plays daniela  the film  s protagoness  is that a word     and asking her to roll in fur . that  s how bad it is .  br    br   from here on in it doesn  t get much better . minutes are wasted as the scenery chewing male actors waffle on about daniela and her condition or something  i can  t remember  but the dialogue is so bad if you don  t laugh at it you  ll cry  .  br    br   the funny thing is daniela isn  t even a werewolf  she  s a psycho who goes mental whenever there is a man around  understandable  as she was raped as a child  so she thinks she becomes a werewolf like her ancestor  the opening scene  . she can  t help but tear out the throat of every man she meets  and she only wants to be loved  things start looking up for daniela as she meets and falls in love with a buff stuntman who doesn  t trigger her  episodes  . check out the montage here  one of the cheesiest you  ll ever see  laughing and hugging after diving headfirst through a window  .  br    br   daniela  s luck doesn  t hold out as the film takes a brutal turn  she is suddenly viciously beaten and raped by a group of thugs who kill the stuntman . reminiscent of  i spit on your grave   daniela extracts bloody vengeance on her rapists .  br    br   this is    minutes of my life i will never get back . but hey  that  s the game you play when you  re a film geek .  ,0
  shower  is an story about loyalty  about the unstoppable advance of modern world in the detriment of rather traditional and more human ways of life . a man forced to choose between his successful career in business  his big  city life  his wife  and his retarded young brother . the eternal doubt between what we want to do and what we should do . the modern china versus the ancient one . the public baths with its gatherings  its cricket fights versus the shopping centres and the skyscraper . lots of old men and women that are no longer needed . china  one country  two systems  as xiao ping said . . . though one of them is killing the other .  br    br   tender  moving  full of funny moments  and of bitter  sweet ones . the sensitive ones will cry and laugh equally . the actors are enormous  especially the one who performs the role of the retarded boy and yang zhang makes a good job  easy  simple  letting the story just flow by itself .  br    br   my rate      ,1

cassandra peterson originally created elvira as the television hostess of late  night horror films  and when the character proved unexpectedly popular she suddenly found herself doing everything from beer commercials to spots on the tonight show with johnny carson . she reached the peak of her popularity in the late     s  and the film elvira  mistress of the dark was the result .  br    br   the plot is flyweight . television horror film hostess elvira dreams of success in las vegas . when her great aunt dies  she travels to new england in hopes that the estate will provide enough money to back a stage show she is disappointed to find she has inherited a rundown house  a poodle  and an old book . it happens that the town is puritanical beyond all description  and she provokes righteous indignation everywhere she goes . it also happens that her great uncle is secretly an evil warlock and very intent on laying hands on  the old book .  throw in a few teenagers  a stud muffin  and a hateful woman with falsies and there you go .  br    br   no one would accuse it of being a cinematic masterpiece  and it does drag now and then . but cassandra peterson demonstrates tremendous flair from start to finish squirmy  sexy  and mixing lowbrow humor with flashes of sharp comedy  she dances through the film like a ringmaster in a circus of corny and often self  mocking jokes . from a flashdance disaster to witchcraft craziness  she is never less than wildly entertaining . it  s a tremendous amount of fun  and the film  s conclusion even manages to generate considerable suspense . will elvira best her evil uncle and save the day  well  i don  t want to give anything away  so let  s just say you  ll have a lot of fun finding out .  br    br   dvd quality is okay and there  s little in the way of bonus material  but if you  re in the mood for something silly this one is sure to answer the urge . and if you  ve never seen tassle  twirling  you  re in for a treat . recommended .  br    br   gft  amazon reviewer  ,1
buford  s beach bunnies gives b  grade ta films a bad name . as a fan of the genre  i was appalled to find little attempt being made to exploit the young actresses talents . i refer specifically to the distinct lack of nudity and simulated sex scenes . what are the next generation of sad teenage boys watching this on late night tv supposed to think   ,0
jon voight is brilliant in midnight cowboy  but hoffman  s performance  though reminiscent of his later turn in rainman  is the kind of performance that keeps me watching movies . as a portrayal of a new york character  only daniel day lewis  portrayal of bill butcher in gangs of new york comes to mind as comparable  and day doesn  t give his character the emotional depth that hoffman gives ratso .  br    br   it  s typical of hoffman  s way of acting that the actor we tend to identify most with midnight cowboy is voight . i think hoffman is one of the  or  best actors in the history of film at playing off the people around him in such a way that he raises their performances far above their normal levels .  br    br   voight  s buck is so naive that he would float out of the film altogether  except that ratso pulls him down  pulls him down  but also teaches him  a lot about how to survive and  more importantly  how to live .  br    br   midnight cowboy is a movie about escape that turns into a movie about finding yourself . i think that  as gritty a movie as it is  it has a very beautiful message  that no matter how much a loser you might be  ratso clearly defines  loser    if you can find a way to be true to yourself  you are in possession of the secret of life  and you might even be able to share that insight with someone else .  br    br   i can  t help but compare midnight cowboy to klute  from a few years later  which i think is more like a movie about finding yourself that turns into a movie about escape .  ,1
i am definitely in the minority opinion on this one .  the hurt locker  has won more  best picture  awards from the critic groups than any other film this year . however  not only did i not like it  i found it hard to sit through .  br    br   there is minimal plot and little character development . they disarm bombs  fight  and disarm more bombs . that is the entire movie .  br    br   but the worst part was that the camera never stops moving and is constantly shaking . this has been a recent fad in film making and it is supposed to make it seem more real because it has a cheap  documentary look to it . the camera was shaking so much it was making me nauseous to look at the screen .  br    br   i normally don  t care for war movies and  the hurt locker  was no exception . but you don  t need to take my word for it because the critics love it .  ,0
  twelve monkeys  is odd and disturbing  yet being so clever and intelligent at the same time . it cleverly jumps between future and the past  and the story it tells is about a man named james cole  a convict  who is sent back to the past to gather information about a man  made virus that wiped out  billion of the human population on the planet back in     . at first cole is sent back to the year     by accident and by misfortune he is taken to a mental institution where he tries to explain his purpose and where he meets a psychiatrist dr . kathryn railly who tries to help him and a patient named jeffrey goines  the insane son of a famous scientist . being provocative and somehow so sensible  dealing with and between reason and madness  the movie is a definite masterpiece in the history of science  fiction films .  br    br   the story is just fantastic . it  s so original and so entertaining . the screenplay itself written by david and janet peoples is inspired by a movie named  la jete        which i haven  t seen  but i must thank the director and writer of the movie  chris marker  for giving such an inspiration for the writers of  twelve monkeys  . i read a little about  la jete   it  s not the same story but it has the same idea  so this is not just a copy of it . david and janet peoples have transformed this great deal of inspiration to a modernized story  which tells about this urgent need for people to find a solution for maintaining human existence and it does it in a so beautiful and a realistic way that it  s a guaranteed thrill ride from the beginning till the end . the music used in the film is odd and somehow so funny and amusing it doesn  t really fit until you really get it and when you do you realise that it  s so compelling  composed by paul buckmaster .  br    br   terry gilliam  who we remember from monty python  as the director of the movie was a real surprise for me  as i really never thought him as a director type of a person . i know he has directed movies before  but i really couldn  t believe that he could make something this magnificent . it shouldn  t be a surprise though  as he does an amazing job . you can still sense that same weirdness as in the python  s  but for me the directing is pretty much flawless though in its odd way of describing things it also makes some scenes strangely disturbing . yes  it is indeed odd  weird  bizarre and disturbing  so it also makes the movie a bit heavy too  so the weak minded viewers will probably find it hard to watch the movie all the way through . it  s not as heavy as you could imagine  but it just has these certain things which in their own purpose are sometimes pretty severe to watch . despite that  the movie holds this pure intelligence inside it and through flashbacks  dreams  jumps between the past and the future it mixes up the whole story in a very clever way and it doesn  t even make the plot messy in any part  though it does need concentration from the viewer after all .  br    br   what comes to acting  well the movie doesn  t even go wrong there . the role of james cole is played by the mighty bruce willis  who probably does his best role performance yet to date . now people may disagree with me  as he did some fine job in for example  the sixth sense  as well  but for me the role of james cole was so ideal for willis and he performs it incredibly well . the character is very well written too  yet performed even better . cole starts to question his own existence and he deals with himself  starting to question his actual time of living  trying to survive and find the crucial missing piece of the puzzle . by hardship he starts to loose his faith  questioning if he can even trust or believe himself . other role performances worth mentioning are the performances of madeleine stow and brad pitt . stow plays the role of kathryn railly  the psychiatrist of james cole  who sees something strangely familiar in cole and decides to help him to deal with his madness . she somehow starts to believe cole  s story but as a believer of science she tries to find solutions through it and tries to deal with reason when it comes to unbelievable things . brad pitt is so good in the role of jeffrey goines and he also does one of his best role performances yet to date . the insane yet hilarious personality of the character brought pitt even an oscar nomination for it  so i guess i  m not praising the honestly fabulous performance for nothing .  br    br   all in all   twelve monkeys  is a great science  fiction experience and it will surely be a recommendation for everyone  especially for the sci  fi fans . it includes brilliant characters and superb role performances  especially from willis and pitt  and an original and an entertaining story which forms a plot that  s so intelligent and clever . yet being that already mentioned weird and disturbing it definitely captures the viewer  s attention by making it interesting and witty . it  s also an explosive thriller and it has romance in it too  so it  s all that in same package and that makes it one of the best sci  fi motion pictures i  ve ever seen . through the odd yet terrific vision of terry gilliam it manages to keep itself in balance despite the somewhat bumpy yet somehow stable ride . hard to explain really  but that  s how it is  it  s mind blowing .  ,1
when i heard that this movie was coming out the night before halloween  i was very excited . when i found out that it was a book  written in      i had to read it before seeing the movie . i  m sure the movie would have been much different to me if i had not read the book . the writers actually did a good job of staying true to the main plot of the book  with minor differences  naturally . i think the thing that disappointed me the most about the movie was boyle playing the role of col . i  m not a big fan of boyle  and it seems that no matter what the mood during the movie  she  s always trying to use her over  plumped lips  and darkly makeup  ed eyes to make herself seem super sexy . indeed  i think that the movie held true to the genuine creepiness of the house . my favorite subplot was the sheehan family  which is so weird b  c the son was killed in iraq and in current events there is casey sheehan whose mother went on a huge anti  iraq tirade  . in the book  obviously the war was not iraq  but rather  vietnam  and when the house turns on that video of the son in the helicopter  i was truly creeped out . overall  i was impressed with the movie  in that it followed the book very well .  ,1
universal soldier the return is not the worst movie ever made . no  that honor would have to go to a film that attempted to make some sort of statement or accomplish some artistic feat but failed in a pathetic or offensive manner . however  perhaps no movie i have ever seen has tried for so little and succeeded so completely as did universal soldier the return .  br    br   this film is a sci  fi  action travesty that has virtually nothing to recommend it . the acting is as bad as any movie i  ve ever seen . the plot is terrible and predictable . the special effects are pathetic . in short  anyone even remotely connected to this film should be ashamed of themselves . us the return makes previous van damme fare seem like groundbreaking cinematic masterpieces . some movies are so bad  they  re good . believe me when i tell you that this is not one of them . i  m really not sure what else to say here . i doubt many people were considering seeing this movie if they hadn  t already  but just in case don  t .  ,0
how can there be that many corrupt cops without any one of them slipping up  with enough cops to run a mini  war that include such weapons as flamethrowers  you would think they would have been caught before someone writing for a weekly coupon newspaper overheard someone saying  thanks  to a corrupt cop .  br    br   you will never get your   ish minutes back . life is too precious to rent this movie .  br    br   i feel bad for the big named actors that made the mistake of making this movie .  br    br   if you like justin timberlake  feel free to rent this movie . he does have a very major part in it  so fans might enjoy seeing him .  br    br   however  i believe most of his fans are young girls  who may be turned off by the violence in this movie .  ,0

i  m somewhat of a fan of lynche  s work  so i was excited when i found this dvd . unfortunately  i was very let down . it  s a series of short cartoons which attempt to show a disturbing and disgusting sort of humor . the animation is very crude  no doubt done using macromedia . each cartoon has a big fat guy beating up his family and generally acting like a jerk to everyone he knows .  br    br   for people who are not familiar with this vein of animation  they will probably be somewhat impressed by it . however  if you  ve spent much time on newgrounds . com  like me  then these cartoons will be no different than any of the other stuff you  ve seen before . many of the popular amateur artists on newgrounds are doing much better work than what was shown on this dvd . if lynch submitted this work to the website  then he would blend in perfectly with some of the better of newgrounds artists . but  since i saw this on dvd  instead of on newgrounds  i give it a      instead of a      as i would have otherwise . these cartoons are fit for the internet  but with a name like david lynch on it  i expected better quality both in story and in animation .  ,0
this film definitely gets a thumbs up from me . it  s witty jokes and even it  s occasional stereotypical and derogatory views on eastern european people had me in stitches throughout most of the film . it  s plot is clever and     original and will have you guessing throughout the entire film . the one person i was most impressed with in this film was hilary duff . it  s plain and simple to see that she has taken a leap of faith stepped outside of the  chick  flick  genre she  s used to . her accent is excellent and her acting performance was surprisingly crisp and well  executed . it is the best performance i have ever seen from hilary  and i have seen most of her films . her character  yonica babyyeah is described as  the britney spears of eastern europe  and this is seen in some of her mannerisms and the song   i want to blow you . . . . . . . . . up  . you also feel sorry for her  as her performance really grasps you  yonica is a very complex and confused character . joan cusack had me laughing throughout the whole film with her sometimes slapstick humour  but also her facial expressions and so on . john cusack  s witty dialogue will probably make you chuckle throughout . i strongly recommend this film .  ,1
hollow man starts as brilliant but flawed scientist dr . sebastian caine  kevin bacon  finally works out how to make things visible again after having been turned invisible by his own serum . they test the serum on an already invisible gorilla  it works perfectly  caine  his team of assistant  s celebrate but while he should report the breakthrough to his military backers caine wants to be the first invisible human . he manages to persuade his team to help him  the procedure works well  caine becomes invisible  however when they try to bring him back the serum fails  he remain invisible . the team desperately search for an antidote but nothing works  caine slowly starts to lose his grip on reality as he realises what power he has but is unable to use it being trapped in a laboratory . but then again he  s invisible right  he can do anything he wants . . .  br    br   directed by paul verhoeven i rather liked hollow man . you know it  s just after christmas  i saw this a few hours ago on late night  early morning cable tv  worst of all i feel sick  not because of the film but because of the chocolates  fizzy pop i  ve had over the past week so i  ll keep this one brief . the script by andrew w . marlowe has a decent pace about but it does drag a little during the middle  has a good central premise  it takes he basic idea that being invisible will make you insane just like in the original the invisible man       film which hollow man obviously owes a fair bit . it manages to have a petty successful blend of horror  sci  fi  action  provide good entertainment value for    odd minutes . i thought the character  s were ok  i thought some of the ideas in the film were good although i think it  s generally known that verhoeven doesn  t deal in subtlety  the first thing he has the invisible caine do is sexually molest one of his team  then when he gets into the outside world he has caine rape a woman with the justification  who  s going to know  that caine says to himself . then of course there  s the gore  he shows a rat being torn apart  that  s just the opening scene after the credits  to be fair to him the violence is a bit more sparse this time around but still has a quite nasty  sadistic tone about it . having said that i love horror  gore  exploitation films so hollow man delivers for me  it  s just that it might not be everyone  s cup of tea .  br    br   director verhoeven does a great job  or should that be the special effects boys make him look good . the special effects in hollow man really are spectacular  more  or  less flawless  their brilliant  it  s as simple  straight forward as that . there  s some good horror  action set  pieces here as well even if the climatic fight is a little over  the  top . i love the effect where kevin bacon disappears one layer at a time complete with veins  organs  bones on full show or when the reverse happens with the gorilla . there  s a few gory moments including a rat being eaten  someone is impaled on a spike  someone has their head busted open with blood splattering results .  br    br   with a staggering budget of about            hollow man is technically faultless  i can imagine the interviews on the dvd where some special effects boffin says they mapped bacon  s entire body out right down to he last vein which they actually did because you know everyone watching would notice if one of his veins were missing or in the wrong position wouldn  t they  the acting was ok  bacon made for a good mad scientist anti  hero type guy .  br    br   hollow man is one of hose big budget hollwood extravaganzas where the effects  action take center stage over any sort of meaningful story or character  s but to be brutally honest sometimes we all like that in a film  well i know i do . good solid big budget entertainment with a slightly nastier  darker streak than the usual hollywood product  definitely worth a watch .  ,1
look carefully at the wonderful assortment of talent put together to make this movie connery  fishburne  capshaw  harris  underwood  beatty  thigpen  even cameos by slezak  lange  and plimpton . they prove  in spades  the adage that a good cast cannot save a bad script . the story line requires so many leaps of faith from the audience that its implausibility should have exceeded even hollywood standards . it  s not particularly original  and the  twists  are downright cruel .  ,0

have never understood why the macdonald  eddy swan song has always been panned so mercilessly   not just by their detractors but by virtually everyone . to me   i married an angel  is more lively and imaginative than any of the duo  s more celebrated outings . the sets and costumes are as lavish as any to be found in an mgm musical  the script is by the reliable anita loos   san francisco    the women    gentlemen prefer blondes   etc .   the rodgers and hart tunes  albeit altered a bit by macdonald  eddy regulars bob wright and chet forrest  are given celestial treatment by herbert stothart  oscar  winner for scoring  the wizard of oz    and best of all  the  singing sweethearts  look great in their contemporary clothes and seem to be having fun with the bizarre proceedings . try to show  rose marie  or  sweethearts  to the uninitiated today and they may very well have a hard time sitting still  but this offbeat  fast  paced fantasy is bound to entertain .  ,1
  the leap years  is a movie adapted from an e  novella by singapore writer catherine lim  which became the first singapore novel  novella to be sold over the internet . the film had a tortuous post  production schedule shot in early      it was slated for release at the end of      but only turn up eventually  years later  on the   th february      a leap year .  br    br   before i say anything  i must first admit i  m no fan of the romance genre  so i may be a little biased against this film  i watched it merely because it was a singapore production  and that it  s available for borrowing at my neighborhood library . here  s my two cents on the movie .  br    br   let  s just start by saying that other than qi yu  wu  s ks and wong li  lin  everybody here of note seems to be a eurasian . the love interest is a eurasian  ananda everingham   and wong  s trio of buddies are all  er  hem  eurasians . does this film perpetuate the stereotype that falling in love and associating with eurasians are more  in  than the common chinese  or whatever asian race you are   i don  t know  it sure seems that way . also  everyone in the movie speaks in some mystical  anglified  accent which doesn  t exist anywhere  certainly not in singapore . it  s the kind of  semi  perfect english  that authorities would like us speak  but which doesn  t exist anywhere outside  say  the mtv channel . the effect is that the dialog of the movie sounds forced and stilted  not helped by the lack of true  blue singaporeans in the cast .  br    br   the scriptwriter seems to be trying too hard to string one  liners after one  liners . after twenty minutes  the  wit  of the movie starts to pall and the film starts serving up its usual plate of clichs .  br    br   i guess i didn  t enjoy the movie because the entire premise of sustaining a love affair over   long years seems unbelievable .  br    br   there are other incredulities in the film . i can  t for one believe that ks  played by qi yu  wu  would fall for one of wong  s girlfriends . and the scene where the bridegroom says   go  before i change my mind   has been used in a hundred east asian  korean  chinese  hong kong  taiwanese etc  tv serials . . .  br    br   so  stars for this film . the production value is fair  and wong li  lin tries her best  but she  s not helped by the script . joan chen has a    minute bit  part in the movie as the older wong and is perhaps the best actress of the lot  but  hey  her role is just cameo .  br    br   if you come across  the leap years  in the rental or library  you may want to pop it in the dvd player for curiosity  s sake  but otherwise  for people who don  t exactly enjoy the romance genre  you can decide whether or not to give it a miss .  ,0
after just finishing the book the same day i watched the movie  i knew what was supposed to happen . i had high expectations of the movie  because of the rating . the only reason i give this movie a  out of   stars is that it was alright trying to be a movie . i have a couple main points for not liking this movie .  br    br    spoilers   br    br    . the casting . jack nicholson barely fits into jack torrence  s character . also  i would have never picked shelly duvall for wendy . i pictured wendy much differently . i can see why they picked jack nicholson though  the grin  the pointy eyebrows  but he  s not supposed to really look  evil  . he  s supposed to look normal  and he turns evil . also  they make one of the worst movie couples . danny was alright  he needed more life though . he acted way to droney .  br    br    . the screenplay . they cut out so many things that were in the book  and added things . some of the things that were in the book that i was looking forward to in the movie were either deleted  changed  or handled wrongly . some of the things that were in the book that i was looking forward to seeing  the hedge animals  the roque mallet  the elevator  were not in the movie  and it was  and half hours   i was extremely irritated .  br    br    . the ending . the ending was changed completly  halorann died  jack froze to death  wendy never got hurt . . . the overlook didn  t blow up . the ending was so cool in the book  and the movie messed it up so horribly  i was apalled . hallorann was never supposed to die  but jack killed him with an ax . if they wanted to kill him  at least have jack use a roque mallet . you never even saw a roque mallet during the whole movie .  br    br   there are other things that i didn  t like about the movie  but there are things that were all right . the camera angels were cool  the blood coming out of the elevator  didn  t happen in the book  was cool  but maybe i was too irritated that the movie didn  t go with the book  to try to be scared at all . i reccomend reading the book  before you see this movie . i applaud stephen king for actually agreeing to sign a contract to not dis stanley kubrik any more . i would never have done that  i would have taken all the rights i could get to yell at him all day . i can  t wait to see the  hour version  at least it has the hedge animals .  br    br   rating      ,0
you know what kind of movie you  re getting into when the serial killer main character is being transported to the electric chair  in what seems to be a bakery truck   only to have the prison vehicle collide with  and i  m not making this up  a genetic engineering tanker truck . the goo which spurts forth melts him  and fuses his dna with the snow  creating our protagonist  the killer snowman .  br    br   my favorite portion of the movie  however  is an over  the  shoulder shot of the snowman thrashing some poor schmuck  in which his hands look suspiciously like a couple of white oven  potholder gloves .  br    br   mmmmm  schlock . . .  ,0
as we all know the sub  genre of sex comedies is pretty crowded . simply being excessively raunchy isn  t enough anymore . i  ve seen and heard so many disgusting jokes and actions that a sex comedy really needs to have other positive points to appeal to me these days .  br    br   coming into the   year old virgin i knew basically what to expect i did see the commercials after all  is it true that if you don  t use it  you lose it   what i didn  t expect to find is a heart and honest attempts at character development . there  s still the weird  off  the  wall  characters that we see so much in adam sandler movies and there  s still enough inappropriate language to sink noah  s ark but somehow the movie has a worthwhile love story and yes even a message .  br    br   the main character andy is  unfortunately for me  a person i can relate to . in the first shot i see that he even shares my love for mystery science theater      he has a poster for the movie on his wall  and throughout the movie we get to see his really neat collection of antiquities . andy also has plenty of video games and a working knowledge of films and technology . andy doesn  t want to buy a car because he prefers his bike . most importantly of all andy is a nice person  he doesn  t swear and he respect women so much that he stays away from them . combine all these factors and everybody begins to think he  s a serial murderer . it  s like my life story .  br    br   the other characters each have funny little stories to go along with their slightly exaggerated personalities and they all work on a certain level but not the way andy does . i felt that it was sort of distracting in a way since andy and his girlfriend trish are really the only truly human characters in the entire movie .  br    br   i suppose since i mentioned one flaw i might as well bring the other noticeable one to light . the story is clever but too predictable and as far as romances go it  s quite simple . it deals with andy  s relationship with trish for a long time and we all know what  s going to happen in the end . sure its final detour is a bit different than we may expect but you know what  s going to happen in the end  and i assure you it does . these are definitely small stains on the movie but there  s so much good here that i can easily ignore it  s few faults .  br    br   when i say  good  i mean  bad  of course . this is a sex comedy and it wants to be bad . for the most part i think it succeeded . there are so many hilarious scenes such as andy trying to get rid of an erection after refusing to have sex with trish . or the scene where andy goes with his trish  s daughter to a sexual education class where he ends up asking more questions than anybody else . ah and we must not forget the soon to be classic chest waxing sequence  ooh  como se llama   an interesting little note about that scene the actor steve carell actually did wax his belly and the pain shown is real . of course they only did one take but it was still a very brave thing to do on his part .  br    br   actually since we  re talking about steve carell  i  d like to say that he has now risen on my list of respected comedians which is sort of odd since i didn  t even know who he was prior to seeing this film . i was just so impressed by his writing  acting and timing that i now really want to keep an eye out for his future roles . this man has talent it the   year old virgin proves that .  br    br   to be honest i had doubts about this film but early word was positive and i knew it was something i was eventually going to see . i  m glad that i did too since it  s probably one of the funniest movies i  ve seen in a long time and it doubles as something you feel is worth watching . it  s not simply a series of sex gags lumped together rather it  s a series of sex gags entwined with a very worthwhile character and a truly touching romance . now excuse me while i go puke my guts out i can  t believe i just wrote that . . .  br    br   my review from frider waves http   friderwaves . com  index . php  pagevirgin  ,1
director fred schepisi  roxanne  directs this well intentioned  but inferior comedy about albert einstein  matthau  trying to hook his scientific niece  ryan  up with ordinary guy tim robbins in order to get her to relax and enjoy life in the      s . to get ryan to like robbins  einstein tries to make robbins look like a brilliant scientist . the idea is cute  but the film falls flat with corny situations and silly dialogue . tim robbins  meg ryan  and the terrific supporting cast do their best to keep this silly comedy afloat  but are unable to rescue the film . its unfortunate that so much talent went into producing such a lackluster movie . i would not recommend to anybody unless they are huge fans of meg ryan .  ,0
this film was the worst film i have ever viewed . it was like a  homework assignment  for a film class . it totally misses the mark when it comes to the  message  it is trying to relay . characters are over exaggerated  poor acting and as for a plot . . . well it is utterly ridiculous . the cover shot is what made me think it may be a decent film  the co  actor is handsome and that  s about it . moral of this movie never judge a movie by it  s cover  save your time  money and energy and make your own home movie and you will be far better off than i . it was painful to watch and quite frankly i am surprised that anyone would spend money to make and distribute it   ,0

to watch this film from start to finish without bursting into laughter at some point requires almost an act of faith  as one has to keep saying to oneself   it  s old    it  s a classic    be kind   not because the movie is so bad  but because at its best it  s so good . this is one dated movie . it  s also a classic  if a tarnished one . i  m not inclined to laugh at people anyway  on principle  and i get more than a little irritated when others do so . to make fun of the informer to my mind is a little like giggling at an idiot savant when he dribbles his orange juice all over the tablecloth . yes  one says to oneself  he is an idiot  and yet when he  s on top of his game he is also a true savant . the same is true for the informer  which is on occasion very dreadful indeed  and yet it boasts splendid photography  some fine acting  a wonderful score and a good  decent simple story . in the end  which i won  t give away  politics  religion and psychology come together  in a church  in such a way as to make the scene seem corny and over the top  and yet so is life sometimes . uneducated people of simple faith behave differently from us  presumably brilliant  modern folks  and the scene isn  t so much unbelievable  i buy it  but i know the irish  as embarrassing . yet people do behave that way  they do say things like that . not everyone is hip  and it may not even be desirable for everyone to be hip . are people today so much superior to those of seventy or eighty years ago  and in what way  i don  t think so . we  re just different . now go watch the movie .  ,1
every once in a while the conversation will turn to  favorite movies .  i  ll mention titanic  and at least a couple people will snicker . i pay them no mind because i know that five years ago  these same people were moved to tears by that very movie . and they  re too embarrassed now to admit it .  br    br   i just rewatched titanic for the first time in a long time . expecting to simply enjoy the story again  i was surprised to find that the movie has lost none of its power over these five years . i cried again . . . . in all the same places . it brought me back to     when i can remember how a movie that no one thought would break even became the most popular movie of all time . a movie that burst into the public consciousness like no other movie i can recall  yes  even more than star wars  . and today  many people won  t even admit they enjoyed it . folks  let  s get something straight   you don  t look cool when you badmouth this film . you look like an out of touch cynic .  br    br   no movie is perfect and this one has a few faults . some of the dialogue falls flat  and some of the plot surrounding the two lovers comes together a little too neatly . however  none of this is so distracting that it ruins the film .  br    br   leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet are wonderful . leo is one of the fine actors of his generation . wait  til you see him in gangs of new york before you call him nothing more than a pretty boy . kate winslet was so strong in this film . the movie really was hers  and she held it together beautifully .  br    br   james cameron managed what many believed was impossible by recreating a completely believable titanic . the sinking scenes were horrific  just as they were that night . how anyone can say the effects were bad is beyond me . i was utterly transfixed .  br    br   this film is one memorable scene after another . titanic leaving port in southampton . rose and jack at the bow   flying  .  iceberg  right ahead   the screws hanging unbelievably out of the ocean . the screams of the doomed after she went down . and that ending that brought even the burliest man in the theater to tears .  br    br   the music  which has also been a victim of the film  s success  was a key ingredient . james horner  s score was simply perfect . and the love theme was beautiful and tragic . too bad celine dion  s pop song version had to destroy this great bit of music for so many .  br    br   i confess  i am a titanic buff . as such  i relished the opportunity to see the ship as we never got to see it   in all its beauty . perhaps watching it sink affected me more than some because i  ve had such an interest in the ship all my life . however  i doubt many of those i saw crying were titanic buffs . i applaud cameron for bringing this story to the masses in a way that never demeaned the tragedy . the film was made with such humanity .  br    br   another reviewer said it better than i ever could open up your hearts to titanic  and you will not be disappointed .  ,1
i can see where the film makers were going with this . but they never really reach their destination . it  s supposed to be a homage to spaghetti westerns albeit set in a sort of mythical modern time frame .  but unfortunately it fall short in its attempt . it doesn  t have that gritty realism that spaghetti westerns are known for . the characters are not vile and desperate enough like their italian western counterparts . and  failing these two points  it lacks the humor of a successful parody . in fact it looks like they intended to make a serious film  but upon completion realized they had missed the mark so far that it couldn  t possibly be taken seriously . unfortunately  they also missed the humor mark by a mile . a whole lotta bad movie   ,0
excellent warner bros effort starring errol flynn in one of his best screen performances . it  s often cited as his best  and i can  t really judge fully until i have seen his  dawn patrol  . however  his work in  they died with their boots on  takes some beating . i  m a big flynn fan  he  s my favourite actor after james mason   it also helps that he  s an aussie  and i think he  s just marvellous  a great screen presence and also a great actor . he is the centrepiece of  gentleman jim  as the legendary boxer with the fancy footwork  but he is also backed up by a literate  warm and funny script  and raoul walsh  s direction . every walsh film i have seen never loses a beat of it  s pace  he truly was a born film  maker . walsh directs the ring scenes beautifully  as he does with the lighter moments and that poignant  great final scene between ward bord and flynn . add to that great production values  the  gay nineties  never looked better   and a lovely supporting cast and it  s pretty much perfect entertainment . alan hale usually played flynn  s sidekick  but here is his father  and it still all works . alexis smith is flynn  s love interest . the pair are head over heels in love with fighting with each other .  ,1
this story is told and retold and continues to be retold in every possibly way imagine . the immortal charles dicken  s story has been recreated in every possible way imagine . i admit i have not seen the classic alistair sim version and i  m sure someday i will but i would be blown away if it touched even close to this amazing eighties version . i believe that if dickens himself had created his story for film this would be it .  br    br   the story is well known  i won  t go into much detail because everyone has seen it in one form or another . a rich  stingy  mean  old man is visited by the ghost of his former partner and warned about his mean ways . in order to straighten him out he is visited by three spirits  each which show him a different perspective of his life and the people he is involved with  past  present and future . finally in seeing all this before him he realizes the error of his ways in a big way and attempts retribution for all the wrong he has done .  br    br   george c . scott is absolutely  undeniably perfect for this role . he takes hold of the ebeneezer scrooge role and makes it his own and creates an incredible character . he is not just a mean old man  but someone who has been effected by certain situations in his life that has made him bitter and angry at the world . there is compassion within him but he holds it below everything else and is very self involved . scott delivers the role of perfection when it comes to scrooge .  br    br   not only does the leading role make this film but everything else fits into place . this is a grand epic of victorian england  dickens england is recreated before our very eyes  the sights and the sounds and you can almost feel the breeze in your face and the smells of the market . director clive donner brilliantly recreates this scene and leaves nothing to the imagination . i could watch this film on mute and be dazzled by the scenery . it  s not spectacular scenery per se but it  s real . the film takes us from the high class traders market to the very dismal pits of poverty and everything in between .  br    br   the rest of the cast fits into their roles and brings their literary counterparts to life . bob cratchitt  played by david warner and his entire family including and especially the young tiny tim played by anthony walters were wonderful . the ghosts each had their own distinct personality and added to the dark mood of this story . a christmas carol is not a light story . dickens wrote this story for a dark period in england  s life and it  s one of the few christmas tales that is really dark  almost scary  and it has to be scary in order to scare a man who has been a miser for so many years into turning around . the dark feel to the story is captured in this film and is downright frightening and yet the end lifts your spirits and captures christmas miracles . the score to this film is also something to be mentioned as it is epic and grand and beautiful to listen to whether it  s the actual score or the christmas music  everything fits together . apparently christmas movies are my favorite because i insist everyone see this christmas carol above all others .       ,1
that   s show is the best tv show ever  period . it  s up there with the andy griffen show  saturday night live  and the simpsons in my book . that   s show continued on for  seasons  all of which focus around a group of teenagers  young adults dealing with relationships  separating from their parents  and their overall futures .  br    br   the two main characters  eric and donna  are two teenagers living next door to each other . they have been living next door to each other for most of their lives  and just begin to feel more feelings for each other at the beginning of the first season . a large amount of the show revolves around how their relationship is working .  br    br   two other characters  red and kitty  are eric  s parents . red was in the service  so he really pushes eric around . kitty is just the opposite . even though she drinks heavily  she treats eric and his friends with a lot of care . bob  their neighbor  is obviously donna  s dad . bob giggles around with several different women throughout the coarse of the show  s story . bob also annoys red to his full extent .  br    br   the remaining character  hyde  kelso  fez  and jackie  are eric  s friends . they also play a major role in the show  s story .  br    br   well  the first season is great . this is when the characters are beginning to feel new things for each other . the first season is original  funny  and enjoyable .  br    br   the second season is good  although it isn  t as good as the first . it is a basic continuation of the first . eric and donna are together  and everything is working out great .  br    br   the third season is my favorite . it went back and captured the first season feel and humor . i also think that the character chemistry improved a bunch  making the show all that more fun to watch .  br    br   the fourth season isn  t near as good . eric and donna arne  t together in this one  making the show slightly less pleasurable . it is still funny  although i didn  t enjoy it as much as the previous seasons .  br    br   the fifth season is the last season i enjoyed all the way through . it is the gang  s senior year  so that really helps with the story . the fifth season also had the best ending out of all the seasons .  br    br   the sixth season is good for the most part . it is extremely funny  although it doesn  t capture the feel that the other seasons did . the gang is out of high school  so i believe that it didn  t hit the teen feel that the previous seasons did . i also didn  t like the last three or four episodes considering that they had a major drama feel to them .  br    br   the seventh season captures the same feel that the  th season had in a way  although it didn  t do it all the way . i enjoyed the seventh season as i did all the others  and the ending is great .  br    br   the last season flat out sucked . eric wasn  t in it  which ruined it . kelso wasn  t in it for the most part either  which didn  t help . i hated the eighth season up until the last episode . i thought that the last episode was really good  and a fitting ending to the series .  br    br   so overall  if you enjoy comedy  give that   s show a try . they stopped making new episodes  but it is still on tv a bunch . i also recommend buying seasons    . it is up to you if you want to buy season  .  ,1
well its official . they have just killed american pie . the first  were absolutely hysterical  but this one and the others have been awful . i mean the story is about two college fraternity  s who battle each other for its houses  i mean come on talk about a weak plot  the first three dealt with growing up  change and marriage  which are all worthy points of development in human society .  br    br   the new stifler is the biggest joke  i know its hard trying to compare yourself with the steven stifler but so no cigar . i give this movie a  because there is    funny bits in the film .  br    br   the best character in this movie of course is jim  s dad i don  t know why he keeps continuing to do these poorly developed films .  ,0
some people seem to think this was the worst movie they have ever seen  and i understand where they  re coming from  but i really have seen worse .  br    br   that being said  the movies that i can recall  ie the ones i haven  t blocked out  that were worse than this  were so bad that they physically pained every sense that was involved with watching the movie . the movies that are worse than war games  are the ones that make you want to gouge out your eyes  or stab sharp objects in your ears to keep yourself from having another piece of your soul ripped away from you by the awfulness .  br    br   war games the dead code isn  t that bad  but it comes pretty close . yes i was a fan of the original  but no i wasn  t expecting miracles from this one . let  s face it the original wasn  t really that great of a movie in the first place  it was basically just a campy   s teen romance flick with some geek  appeal to it .  br    br   that  s all i was hoping for  something bad  but that might have tugged at my geek  strings . was that too much to ask for  is it really not possible to do better than the original war games  even for a straight to video release  well apparently that was too much to ask for . stay away from this movie . at first it  s just bad  like  oh yeah  this is bad  but i  m kind of enjoying it  maybe the end will be good like in the original .  and then it just gets worse and worse  and by the end  trust me  you will wish you had not seen this movie .  ,0
i love morgan freeman . paz vega is an attractive  appealing and talented actress . i  m sure that this would have been a good movie had anything happened in it . nothing does . it  s short  less than   minutes  . it was   minutes too long . after an hour of frustration  i scanned through the remaining    odd minutes . excruciating .  br    br   freeman plays an actor  who hasn  t worked in a while  researching a part that he might play  as a checkout clerk in a supermarket . he visits the supermarket where she works . nothing happens . she decides to give him a ride home and they go to an arby  s  a target  a car wash . nothing happens . they converse about their lives . nothing happens . ever .  br    br   i don  t get it . but i also don  t get the bill murray flicks  lost in translation  and  broken flowers  . if you like those movies  maybe you  ll like this . lots of people find movies like this whimsical  charming  or  for reasons that escape me  find the dialog fascinating . a common device in movies of this ilk is to have a long take of stillness  silence after an actor delivers a line that  s supposed to be meaningful . we know it  s meaningful because it  s followed by two minutes of nothing on the screen . sorry  i must be a philistine . i don  t get it . to me  these kinds of movies aren  t funny  or charming  or thought  provoking . they  re just boring . why  because there  s no comedy . no drama . no tension . no laughs . no suspense . no action . nothing to watch . in short  none of the things i go to the movies for . i can be bored for free . i see oddball  quirky characters in real life . i go to target  and fast  food restaurants  and car  washes . these elements do not a movie make  even if stars are doing this stuff . i pay to be entertained .  br    br   if you  re crazy about morgan freeman and just like to hear him ramble on about nothing  have fun . if you wanna drool over paz vega  you can look and listen to her . but nothing happens  i promise . a total snoozefest .  ,0
i agree with the other comments . i saw this movie years ago . christopher plummer is hilarious as a dandy . the ribaldry is unsurpassed . if this comes out on video  i will definitely buy it .  ,1
director vincenzo natali first showed his penchant for character  based sci  fi flicks with his     short film  elevated   wherein  people remain trapped in an elevator while unseen monsters roam the building . his follow  up feature project  cube   released later that year  had a very similar premise  this time with  people and instead of an elevator it was a vast expansion of interlocking cubic deathtraps . both were admirable attempts to take the sci  fi genre a step further  by deliberately declining to show almost any visual stimulation  choosing instead to spend as much time as possible focusing on the human element  how the characters act  react and interact under incomprehensible and dangerous conditions . after his exploration into the mainstream with      s  cypher   natali has come back to his bizarre character  film trend to bring us  nothing   his latest  and by far most optimistic and comedic take on the wide cinematic world of  what if    br    br   dave  david hewlett  and andrew  andrew miller  are life  long friends  brought together by a mutual detachment from society and a lack of any one else to be with . dave  who has always been hindered by a selfish and somewhat dimwitted nature  lives rent  free with andrew at his ill  located and ill  constructed house  where he often takes advantage of andrew  s neurotic and antisocial mentality . despite all this  the two misfits are happy together  until one day their deep character flaws  coupled with some astronomically bad luck  land them in the middle of some pretty serious  jail  sentence  worthy trouble . on top of this  they discover that their house has been deemed unfit for existence and is scheduled to be demolished before sunset  so in the hazy  nightmarish panic of everything going wrong for them  they wish that the whole world would just disappear . and it does .  br    br   going any further with the synopsis would compromise a lot of the film  s slow  occasionally too slow  reveal about what  s happened to dave and andrew  and how they deal with their new reality . natali  s fascination with studying human behavior under duress  ala the birds  is here in spades  but simply by making the main characters friends rather than strangers  he  s able to break away from the thriller  horror element of this premise to open it up to a more comfortable and optimistic level . it  s almost as if he  s made the aphoristic opposite of  cube  .  br    br   of course  the film is not   minutes of laughter and sunshine . in keeping with fundamental realism  our two anti  heroes  dynamic often becomes antagonistic  sometimes with rather nasty results . like the  desert island  game  the film looks at how even best friends  when left alone together  can fall apart  but at the same time it shows that friends are vital to the quality of existence . in a very twisted  sci  fi way  this is a feel  good flick  with good heart and good intentions .  br    br   however  there are a few qualms to be had with  nothing  . while the two lead actors  hewlett and miller  do well with their parts  their characters are not nearly as interesting as they should have been  considering it is completely up to them to entertain us for the better part of an hour . there is some development in the relationship and personalities of dave and andrew  some background is given  but ultimately not enough . a generous viewer will sit through the less  engaging portions of the film to see it through to the end  but cynics will probably give up pretty fast .  br    br   acting  as mentioned  is adequate  and considering the amount of  green  screen  work that would  ve been needed  reasonably convincing . david hewlett and andrew miller  who both wrote co  wrote the screenplay  have been long  time friends of vincenzo natali hewlett has in fact featured in every film natali has made . perhaps it was their creative input that steered this film in a more positive direction . nonetheless  the story could have been a lot more involving . granted  it is relatively entertaining considering that  no pun intended  nothing really happens  but you get the impression that  in more experienced hands  a lot more could  ve been done with this premise .  br    br   in all fairness   nothing  is an impressive piece of work in many ways . the concept is interesting  the direction is inventive  the script works on a human level and  most of all  it shows a progression in natali  s creative mentality . for fans of his work  this will be a delight  and for others it will be a nice way to pass a little unwanted time . it  s just a shame that the director  s fixation on human drama prevented it from being the great  fun film it could have been .  ,1

nowhere near the original . it  s quite accurate copy bringing nothing new to the story . but the directing is very poor . basinger is weak  without good directing . baldwin is simply just a second league compared to mcqueen . i watched it just out of curiosity  being a huge fan of peckinpah  s masterpiece  and i got what i thought . almost a b movie with second rate acting and directing . i wasn  t even disappointed  i just don  t know what they were trying to do . this remake doesn  t try to play with the original material  it  s not a tribute and indeed it lacks some really good actor of its era .  br    br   it reminds me of a bad xerox copy of wonderful photograph .  br    br   this is a complete waste of your time . save yourself  hours or watch the original  again     ,0
absolutely fantastic .  br    br   now  before a legion of cinema purists choke on their latts  allow me to elaborate . much as i enjoyed it  this is quite simply one of the worst films i have ever seen and is certainly the worst film i  ve seen at the cinema  an impressive claim  as i remember seeing daredevil on the big screen  . the two leads  daniel gillies and elisha cuthbert  were unconvincing at best and downright awful at worst . of course  they weren  t helped by a script that had as much emotional depth as a daphne  celeste single and characterisation that was about as convincing as the oj defence . the plot  to stretch the term slightly  was thin to non  existent and the  gore  scenes  whilst undoubtedly brutal  were irrelevant and laughably formulaic . what plot there is revolves around a twenty  something model  cuthbert  who is abducted  imprisoned and subjected to various visceral tortures  both psychological and physical . the torture scenes feel like disconnected set pieces and the emphasis was laid squarely upon shocking rather than scaring the audience . whilst there really are very  very few positives to draw from this film  its redeeming features are the very flaws that make it such a dreadful film . i have never heard a more vocal audience in a cinema . within twenty minutes  the entire cinema was in stitches and remained that way throughout . for my part i came out flushed with laughter  buoyed by a film that had ascended to the pinnacle of appalling film  making . whichever way you look at it  this is truly a cinematic achievement and a blueprint for future directorial wannabes detailing minutely how not to make a film .  br    br   p . s . i omitted to mention that i managed to get in to the film free . . . so i can afford to laugh about it . i was still tempted to ask for my money back . . . it really was that bad .  ,0
i stopped watching lost at this episode because i thought ana  lucia and libby  s deaths were unnecessary and really depressing . then i found out that they kept libby around just to die in the next episode  gah  i can  t handle it .  br    br   i liked this show for the first season  but it definitely declined in the second season  i found jack and locke  s little religious feud to be annoying . the deaths of rodriguez  watros  characters was the final straw   br    br   i give this episode a      for being the end to my viewing of this formerly great series created by alias legend j . j . abrams . i hope his series in the future will improve on this one .  ,0

in the process of trying to establish the audiences  empathy with jake roedel  tobey maguire  the filmmakers slander the north and the jayhawkers . missouri never withdrew from the union and the union army was not an invading force . the southerners fought for state  s rights the right to own slaves  elect crooked legislatures and judges  and employ a political spoils system . there  s nothing noble in that . the missourians could have easily traveled east and joined the confederate army .  br    br   it seems to me that the story has nothing to do with ambiguity . when jake leaves the bushwhackers  it  s not because he saw error in his way  he certainly doesn  t give himself over to the virtue of the cause of abolition .  ,1
this utterly dull  senseless  pointless  spiritless  and dumb movie isn  t the final proof that the world can forget about danny boyle and his post   trainspotting  movies  the beach  already took care of that . what this low  budget oddity does is merely to secure his place among those who started very well but got completely lost in drugs  booze  ego  self  delusion  bad management or whatever it was that lead to this once  promising director  s quick demise .  br    br   the premise is absurd two losers  ecclestone and some bimbo jenna g  a rapper  likely  meet by chance and spontaneously start singing with fervour more akin to lunatic asylum inhabitants than a potential hit  making duo  which they become . a friend of theirs  an even bigger illiterate loser  becomes their manager by smashing a store window and stealing a video  camera by which he films them in  action   and then shows the tape to some music people who actually show interest in this garbage . now  i know that the uk in recent years has put out incredible junk  but this is ridiculous the music makes oasis seem like the beatles . during the studio recordings  the duo  strumpet  change lyrics in every take and ecclestone quite arrogantly tells the music biz guys to take it or leave it  and quite absurdly they do take it . not only is the music total and utter trash  but its  performers  are anti  social these newcomers are supposed to be calling the shots . it  s just too dumb . it  s plain awful .  br    br   the dialog is unfunny and goes nowhere  and this rags  to  bitches story has no point and makes no sense . it often feels improvised  under the influence of drugs . danny boyle is a complete idiot . this little piece of trash is so bad it  s embarrassing to watch . ecclestone  s i . q . also has to be questioned for agreeing to be part of this nonsense . whoever financed this      joke should leave the movie business before they end up selling their own underwear on street corners .  ,0
first of all   st . ives  the film is only fairly loosely based on the robert louis stevenson story of the same name  but for once  this is not a criticism . the original novel was a work  in  progress  unfinished at the author  s death  and in freely adapting it and giving it an ending  the film  makers have brought to life some endearing characters who  although different from stevenson  s originals  would  i am sure  have charmed and amused him .  br    br   it is      capitaine jacques de kroual de saint  yves is a breton aristocrat  orphaned by the revolution  s guillotine  now serving as a hussar in napoleon  s army . we meet him going out for the evening  claiming that since a hussar who is not dead by   is  a blackguard   he  at    is now  on borrowed time   certainly  as he faces a string of challenges to duels  our dashing hero seems in danger  but a surreal prank on his colonel provides him a way out of the duels and into the bed of a beautiful courtesan  singer . unfortunately  it also results in losing his commission . . . further misadventures result in him being taken prisoner by the british  and sent to a pow camp in a scottish castle .  br    br   while carving toys and boxes  jacques catches the attention of flora  the young niece of miss susan gilchrist  a well  travelled woman of the world who lives at swanston cottage . they fall in love  and most of the story concerns flora helping jacques to escape and to find his emigr grandfather  the old comte . of course  there is a problem . jacques  older brother  alain  a dissolute alcoholic  is  perhaps understandably  far from pleased when grandfather disinherits him in front of the whole household  the very instant that jacques has appeared . . . cue treachery  there is also an entertaining subplot of the romance between the awkward  naf but good  hearted major farquhar chevening and aunt susan  who has travelled through most of the ottoman empire and been a prisoner of the turks .  br    br   even allowing for a natural prejudice in favour of any film in which the heroines share my surname   st . ives  is magic  it combines splendidly swashbuckling swordfights  a balloon  flight  comedy and romantic adventure . i would recommend it to anyone who loves  the kind of film they don  t make anymore   fairbanks  colman  flynn   co . the acting is splendid . anna friel makes flora a spirited and appealing heroine  and jean  marc barr is delightful as jacques  a genuinely lovable hero . miranda richardson and richard e . grant are already great favourites of mine  and have great fun as susan and farquhar  whose relationship runs as a comic counterpoint to that of the leads . as the rakish  scheming  but ultimately tragic alain  jason isaacs shows  as he did more recently in  the patriot   that he has the classic swashbuckling style  besides the dashing good looks  please  please will someone cast him as a hero in the genre      br    br   my main quibbles with the film concern settings and costumes . in the book  the castle in which jacques is a prisoner is clearly edinburgh  but the film  shot in ireland  germany and france has  highlandised  the setting  making the retention of place names such as swanston  inveresk and queensferry decidedly incongruous . the costumes too are a real hotch  potch  from     s through to the period in which it is set . while this would not be implausible with more down  market characters  making do   it seems odd for well  to  do ladies such as the heroines to be wearing     s gowns in     . clearly  the costuming decision was sthetic these earlier styles are visually far more appealing and elegant than regency fashions  and they work in the idealised world of the film . as a whole   st . ives  is   minutes of pure delight .  ,1
the one and only season has just aired here in australia and i thought it was absolutely brilliant  i love it  all the story lines are so good  and its a much more realistic view on teen and family life today . yet it still kept strong family values of sticking together and being there for each other . their problems were real  and it really drew you into the show . the show is basically about this family called  the days  and their lives . the family consisted of abby day  mum   jack day  dad   natalie day  sporty daughter   cooper day  outsider son   and nathan day  boy genius son  . each episodes a day of their life  with coopers perspective on things throughout it . i loved cooper his insight through out the show was just great . he was by far my favorite character . it ended with so many things it could  ve continued with  i  m really sad another season wasn  t made . it was a great show i  m gonna miss it .  ,1
so don  t even think about renting this from the shops  because this is one hell of a bad movie . you  d think that jj abrahams had written this movie . basically  a rat is flushed down the toilet and somehow has to get back out . fans of the completely terrible  shrek  might enjoy  but  wallace  gromit  fans will probably turn away in disgust . also  why didn  t they do it in plasticine or clay  i mean  cgi animation   for an aardman movie     obviously  aardman lazed around while they let dreamworks do the whole thing . wrong  wrong  wrong    nearly every single character is awful  apart from that freaky frog guy  who is just right for a movie villain . but everything else about the movie is dull  dull  dull    i almost fell asleep with boredom watching this movie . no  wait  actually  i did fall asleep with boredom watching this movie . it  s just terrible . but thankfully  it  s not as bad as  shrek .   ,0

it was a doubly interesting experience . for some reason the greatest scientific mind of the   th century had never been the central figure in a movie . the closest i can think of as films with einstein in them are champaign for caesar  where  like a  deus ex ma  china   the great man is heard clarifying a point on a radio quiz show  so that ronald colman is proved to have given the correct answer after all  and in bullshot where the great albert is one of a dozen leading physicists and scientists who are drugged with cannabis by the villain  intent on stealing some machines of theirs . it is notable that in those two cases  and in iq  we are dealing with comedies . so far nobody has tried to do a serious film about the life of einstein  like john huston  s attempt to do one on freud with montgomery cliff . i guess it is just too hard to get the world of mathematical equations or the secrets of electro  magnetic field theory into exciting dialog . but then  only three years ago russell crowe and christopher plummer did a beautiful mind . maybe nobody really has tried .  br    br    subsequently  after writing this  i remembered the successful comedy young einstein with yahoo serious about ten years ago . but that is an exception and it was a spoof .   br    br   the other surprise was the actor playing the great albert . it was walter matthau  here taking time away from the series of films he did with jack lemmon in that last decade of their careers . matthau was a highly capable and gifted character actor  in both comedy and drama  but normally his comic personas were variants of his  whiplash willie  gingrich from the fortune cookie . they were connivers and gonifs . later they would shed their criminal propensities because we had grown to like them  but they remained grumpy types . but his albert einstein happens to be genuinely sweet . more like his kotch than like willie clarke .  br    br   he plays albert as good old uncle albert . it seems that matthau  s einstein is living in princeton with his niece catherine boyd  meg ryan   and she is seeing a stuffy professor named james morland  stephen fry  . but fry  s car needs repairs  and they take it to the auto shop where ed walters  tim robbins  works . robbins falls for ryan  who is attracted to him  but finds that he lacks the mental equipment that she admires . good old uncle albert  aided by his three friends  lou jacobi  joseph maher  and gene saks  decide to give their assistance to robbins and make him an apparently unrecognized physics genius . this will open the doors of romance between him and ryan  provided ryan is impressed and fry does not spoil things  as he hopes to do  .  br    br   the atmosphere is sweet  as when matthau and his chums rig up a super physics quiz that they help robbins cheat on  by switching the positions of their bodies  . the plot eventually leads to the outright lie that the brilliant robbins has constructed an atomic powered rocket ship  which brings in the interests of the nation in the figure of president eisenhower  keene curtis  .  br    br   it was a charming comedy  and an interesting stretch for matthau in that he was not as hyper as normal  but far more subdued .  ,1
this was the first regular filmed columbo movie episode but yet it aired as the second  after steven spielberg  s  columbo murder by the book  . it  s also at the same time among one of the better ones   br    br   bernard l . kowalski was one great creative director  no wonder that they later asked him to direct three more columbo movies . the movie has some real creative and innovative shot sequences and the movie as a whole is also clearly made with style  passion and eye for detail . every shot connects and is a reason why this movie is better and also better looking just any other average made for tv movie . it  s definitely one of the better directed columbo movies .  br    br   it  s a quit original columbo entry for a couple of reasons . the murder is more or less an accident and was an impulsive act . so the killer this time doesn  t have any time to plan out the  perfect murder  in advance and his to clean up any of the traces afterward and has to dispose the body . the killer in this movie is not only being handled as the man who committed the crime but more as the man who helps out lieutenant columbo to solve the murder . it makes the character a more interesting and layered one as well and also helps to make the way columbo solves the whole crime seem way more interesting as well because of that . of course columbo starts to suspect him pretty early on and as always he comes to solution by making himself vulnerable and look more stupid than he of course truly is and by gaining the killer  s trust . this is obviously no spoiler since this is the way every columbo movie gets set  up . i liked the story of the movie and how it progressed .  br    br   it also helps the movie that it has such a fine cast . at the time of this movie peter falk had really made the columbo character his own and the character at this was already fully developed . robert culp is truly great as the short tempered brimmer . funny thing is that he would later star in three different columbo movies again and one  mrs . columbo  episode  only in totally different roles . he even played the murderer in a couple of those movies as well again . he by the way was not the only actor that did this in other later columbo movies . also the great ray milland makes an appearance in this movie  as the husband of the victim .  br    br   all in all  a real great early columbo movie and among the better ones out of the long running series of movies .  br    br        ,1
 . . oh wait  i can  this movie is not for the typical film snob  unless you want to brush up on your typical cinematic definitions  like  continuity editing  and  geographic match  . i couldn  t tell where i was in this movie . one second they  re in the present  next minute their supposedly in the    s driving a modern suv and wearing what looked like to me as    s style clothing . i think . i couldn  t pay long enough attention to it since the acting was just horrible . i think it only got attention because it has a  d which i did not watch . if you  re a b  movie buff  and by b  movie i mean bad movie  then this film is for you . it  s home  movie and all non  sense style will keep you laughing for as long as you can stay awake . if your tastes are more for goddard and antonioni  though  just skip this one .  ,0

a lot of people seemed to have liked the film  so i feel somewhat bad giving it a bad review . but after sitting through   minutes of it  i feel i have to do so . where the heck is the plot in this film   i must have missed it  i was waiting for the storyline to unfold and nothing happened . sure the ending was  somewhat shocking  but they didn  t build up to it . i forgot who was who half of the time  so they didn  t really develop the characters . the acting was so  so  most of the time it was believable  but i was able to see through it most of the time . so . . . without giving anything away  i must say that unless you like the actors in the film  there is no real reason to watch this movie . i could be mistaken  but i just didn  t understand why there was so little  or too much of the film . i can  t decide which one that would be  so i say judge for yourselves . i don  t even know if renting it would be a good idea  the cost and all . . .  br    br   plot     characters     acting     overall     i feel like that  s too high really  i am staying with my vote up at the top .  ,0
having seen the hot eliza dushku in the pretty good wrong turn  i decided to pick this one up instead of return of the living dead  of all movies . haven  t seen that one yet  but  considering it is one of the most highly acclaimed horror movies ever  safe to say i made the wrong choice . there is simply nothing to recommend this movie  and i am talking about the supposedly superior killer cut . it didn  t even have the youthful sex appeal of mediocre to poor movies like i know what you did last summer or valentine or urban legend . it simply made no sense  held no excitement  had very little interesting acting or compelling writing . the release date was apparently put off numerous times for about a year running  and the reason is obvious . the whole movie comes off as a bunch of meaningless scenes thrown together haphazardly  to meaningless effect . get wrong turn instead  if you want to see dushku . i would like to see a movie with her and the super  hot elisabeth harnois   but i don  t think even that would have made this movie watchable . casey affleck  so promising in good will hunting  is awful here   he seems to lack both intelligence and guts . that  s enough on this one .  ,0

this is a great movie that everyone should see . it plays like a dean koontz book .  br    br   bill paxton  s performance was great in that it really seems like he believes in what he is saying and doing .  br    br   i don  t know why viewers have to read in some kind of advocacy for religious murder in to the film . it is fiction . the ending is surprising  but fictional . so what  i think that is what makes this movie so good . spoiler do not read further if you havent seen the movie . throughout the movie  the viewer is continually shocked at the sickness of paxton  s character  the impact on the children  and the way the children handle this outrageous conduct . and then at the end  it turns out to be true . god has put him on a mission to rid the world of demons . paxton is not clairvoyant as other viewers suggest . sure  he is given info that he couldn  t have known otherwise  but the movie goes further to show how god is  protecting  adam through the convenient video quality problem and the complete lack of memory of the second fbi agent . the film isn  t advocating christian murder  it is merely taking the viewer on a very unexpected ride .  ,1
this is right up at the top of my list of the most hysterically funny shows i  ve ever seen . i laughed so hard  i  m sure i missed half the jokes . this showcases izzard as the brilliantly gifted comedian he is . what i particularly like is that he seems never to be  dumbing down  the material for his audience . his timing is impeccable and the routine is tied together as a performance piece rather than just a series of gags . thumbs way up .  ,1
i am not a huge fan of camp kitsch and the  so bad it  s good  type of viewing . however  i really like this film for its fun factor and  believe it or not  it  s innovation .  br    br   the whole thing has a ring of john waters and is boundlessly enthusiastic  but with some superb actors and considered direction making the most of the slapstick and styalised movements . billy zane moves with incredible expression  see the scene on the bus for a text  book lesson in how to use movement  and is framed by some unexpected stars .  br    br   you may not like this film  you may not enjoy it  but if you get the chance to watch it  then spare the time because chances are you will end the film with a confused smile on your face  and a new perspective on the sense of humour of some big stars . highly reccomended .  ,1
this movie is good for what it is  and unpretentious i wouldn  t watch it twice  however i am a peter cushing completist and that  s why i watched it . the best asset of this movie is brevity and effectiveness . compared to other similar movies  it does not drag its feet forever as each of the four  plus one  segments lasts under   minutes  with the last under   . good uncanny vibes . in the first segment  horror writer suffering from  writer  s block  relocates to secluded old house seeking inspiration . he finds even too much of it when he starts to visualize one of his fictional madmen . plot contrivance similar to premature burial . good use of the point  of  view twist is the writer getting mentally ill . . . or  as the ending shows  his trophy wife wants her lover to play along with the husband  s phobias to drive him mad  secure his estates . . . yet will the scheming bimbo survive to enjoy the fruit of her ingenious plan   br    br   in the second segment two long time lost friends get together in the same secluded old house but cannot seem to help visiting a bizarre horror museum featuring the wax statue of the long lost love of their youth  which had once separated them . from the gothic museum keeper they learn the woman portrayed is a deceased ax wielding murderer . . . or was she   br    br   the third segment was the less interesting to me .  br    br   the fourth shows a horror movies actor  who thinks he  s the best of all  sunken to the depths of low budget c movies . seeking a costume to lend more credibility to his fictional vampire  he gets the real deal . this segment also lacks the solidity of the first two .  br    br   acting is fair  with the  initial segments contributing the bulk of it . good movie  taken with a grain of salt . not the best cushing  nor lee . . . but worth watching .  ,1
sadly  the print of the film we were going to watch burned in the fire at universal studios last week  so we were stuck with video . that could even be a metaphor for this second  rate king kong movie from toho studios  stalwart director ishiro honda . essentially it  s a warm up for  king kong versus godzilla  . it even uses the idea of a mecha  kong  like mecha  godzilla . of course the movie climaxes with king kong fighting mecha  kong on top of the expo tower in tokyo  but if you didn  t know that already then maybe you  re in the age group that this movie was intended for .  br    br   the cast is headed by a guy named rhodes reason who we had never heard of . . . glancing over his list i see mostly a lot of scattered american tv credits  so it  s interesting that they dragged him all the way to japan so that they could have a nominal american hero . the real hero of the movie is the more sensitive japanese commander played by akira takarada  who i recognized from hiroshi inagaki  s iconic version of  chushingura     ronin  and also from the original godzilla films by honda . i  m sorry rhodes reason whoever you are  but this guy has way more screen presence and you can bet that everyone wants him to end up with the cute little blonde  played by linda miller . we laughed at the way reason would always find a way to interject himself between miller and takarada  who it seemed like she kind of preferred . of course like all kong leading ladies her primary relationship is with the king himself . she discovers a nice trick if you talk to a giant ape really . . . . . really . . . . slowly . . . . . he  ll understand what you  re saying . and if you  re a blonde gal  that means that he  ll do whatever you tell him to do . that fact is not lost on dr . who  eisei amamoto  and madame piranha  mie hama    representing a  nation which shall not be named    who plan on using her as bait to get kong to dig up mineral deposits that are trapped at the north pole .  br    br   yes  this is truly the plot of the whole movie   apparently only a giant ape is going to be capable of digging out these minerals which can be used to make super powerful weapons . dr . who builds mecha  kong to get it but the circuitry gets in the way  so they decide to go for the real kong . kong himself seems momentarily infatuated with mecha  kong  a story element that might have made the film more interesting but wasn  t followed up on .  br    br   by the end of the movie  the cute blonde has shouted  kong  or  king kong  in her chirpy voice so many times that when the two heroes tell her to let him go at the end they  re speaking for all of us . basically this movie squanders whatever majesty was possible in the kong character by making him a heroic and friendly figure much too early  just like the newest version of the story . kong is just a guy in a suit in this movie  and they show quite a lot of him to the point where the goofy face becomes impossible to take seriously . it  s a nice looking movie  i  m sure it satisfies the demands or desires of fans of this type of thing  which is really more of a wrestling film than a monster film in a lot of ways . the monsters don  t ever really scare in these films  they just jump around and push each other around a lot . it  s not a worthless movie  but it  s extremely predictable and formulaic so for anyone under the age of   or so it probably will only be entertaining as comedy .  ,0
this movie pretty much surprised me . i didn  t have very high expectations for it but i was wrong . mary  rhoda was very funny and well written . they didn  t spend too much time rehashing the past so they weren  t relying on the success of the old tv show to carry the movie . overall it was very entertaining .  br    br   my girlfriend commented that this could be a weekly sit  com and i think i might agree with her .  ,1
the plot of the thinner is decidedly thin . and gross . an obese lawyer drives over the gypsy woman  and the gypsy curse causes him to lose and lose weight . . . to the bone . ok  gypsy curses should be entertaining  but the weight  losing gone bad  nope . except stephen king thinks so . and michael mcdowell  other horror author and the screenwriter of this abysmal film  does so  too . the lawyer is not only criminally irresponsible  he is fat too  haha  the thinner is like an immature piece of crap for a person who moans how he  she has never seen anything so disgusting than fatness . hey  i can only say well  look at the mirror .  ,0
it as absolutely incredible to me that anyone could make the comment that this film is not preachy . it is not only oppressively preachy  but absurd  stagebound  dramatically straight  jacketed  and painfully overwrought . watching it  one feels like an  year old child being punished by having to write  i will not become a fascist  on the blackboard    times .  br    br   now i understand that it was made during the height of ww   and was intended to be a brave condemnation of hitler and the terrible suffering he brought about   which anyone would whole  heartedly applaud  and i  m sure it accurately captured the mood of the day . but it is presented in such an immature  over  obvious  sledgehammer way  it fails abysmally as a work of art .  br    br   the only good performances here are from paul lukas  who brings sincerity and intensity to his role as a quietly heroic anti  fascist and lucile watson as the amusingly ill  mannered rich grandmother who slowly comes to realize how dangerous the world has become . though their rootless upbringing has subjected them to all kinds of hardships  the children are ridiculously shown as robotically well  behaved little snips . they do not even remotely resemble real human beings . and bette davis  a great actress  here is so one dimensionally noble i cringed every time she was on screen . her every word  her every gesture is meant to convey how supportive and understanding she is of the sacrifices her husband has to make and the great cause he is fighting for  that she must  ve been wired to receive a painful electric shock if she dared allowed any hint of doubt or shading to surface in her portrayal .  br    br   so yes  this is a very important film  just not a very good one .  ,0
i was hoping this was going to be good as a fan of timothy dalton  s james bond and although it wasn  t his deserved   rd bond outing  it was a laugh . belushi brought some good humour to his part and dalton hammed it up nicely  but was probably underused . his part was liked a camped up version of jack nicholson in a few good men . the other brit in it was a bit shocking  but overal it was a laugh .  ,1
totally forgettable . specially because of the weak acting . this is the first movie i  ve seen with dax shepard . to my surprise  he  s been around since the late    s . i thought he was a newcomer  since his acting was so bland . i could say the same about liv tyler . although i  ve seen her do well in other movies  she gave clare cooper a strange personality . liv is not the kind of actress that will give the character a fiery  emotional personality like diane keaton would be able to  but it was pretty strange to see her say her lines in whisper mode . it seemed that altogether there simply wasn  t a very good chemistry going on between the actors  and i think diane keaton sensed that as well . she  s a fantastic actress  but seemed just a bit over the top in this movie . it felt like she just wanted to get this movie over as soon as possible . i wouldn  t blame her .  ,0
as i watch this film  it is interesting to see how much it marginalizes black men . the film spends its time showing how powerless the most visible black man in it is  save for an heroic moment  . for much of the film  the other black men  and dark  skinned black women  in the film are way in the background  barely visible .  br    br   vanessa williams  character was strong and sympathetic . the viewer can easily identify and sympathize with her . there are also some fairly visible and three  dimensional support characters who are light  skinned  and some white characters of some warmth and dignity . but    of the black males in this film are nothing but invisible men . voiceless shadows in the background  of no consequence . such a horrible flaw  but anything but unusual in the mainstream media .  ,0
i just got through watching this dvd at home . we love westerns  so my husband rented it . he started apologizing to me half way through . the saddles  costumes  accents   everything was off . the part that made me so mad is where the guy didn  t shoot the  collector  with his bow and arrow as he was taking the fat guy  s soul . his only excuse was  he only had  arrows left .  we watched it all the way through  and  as someone else said . . . too many bad things to single out any one reason why it sucked . i mean  the fact that the boy happened to snatch the evil stone from the collector on the same month and day it was found  what  s the point of that  and why were there a grave yard where everyone died on april   but the people whose souls were taken by the collector were still up walking around  if you want a movie to make fun of after a few beers  this may be your movie . however  if you want a real western  you will hate this movie .  ,0
i read somewhere that hollywood should concentrate on remaking bad movies and leave the classics alone . we can only hope . while this remake wasn  t a total waste  i still wish i had the six bucks back to go toward a dvd of the original . lots of violence and one of the worst endings i  ve ever seen . this version doesn  t add anything new . it only reiterates why hollywood should leave the good stuff alone .  ,0
sudden impact is a two pronged story . harry is targeted by the mob who want to kill him and harry is very glad to return the favour and show them how it  s done . this little war puts harry on suspension which he doesn  t care about but he goes away on a little vacation . now the second part of the story . someone is killing some punks and harry gets dragged into this situation where he meets jennifer spencer a woman with a secret that the little tourist town wants to keep quiet . the police chief is not a subtle man and he warns harry to not get involved or cause any trouble . this is harry callahan trouble follows him . the mob tracks him to this town and hell opens up as harry goes to war . meanwhile the vigilante strikes again and the gang having figured it out is ready for her . jennifer spencer is caught and harry comes to her rescue during the film  s climax . sudden impact is not the greatest dirty harry but at the time it gives us a harry that is very much an anti hero ready to go to war just to pursue justice . again not the best not the worst but the one with the most remembered line . go ahead make your day .  ,1
i wait for each new episode  each re  run with anticipation  the new look of sci  fi created by stargate sg   is a wonder that i hope will never end . to combine the past with the future is a new twist that is fascinating to me . season   should be a thrill in itself . i wish that richard dean anderson would show up more often in the new season  as i love his dry wit as much as his temper tantrums in his character as jack o  neill . the other characters add their own uniqueness to the show that makes it a winner  season after season . you cancel this program in the next three years  and you make a serious mistake . also  you need a bigger role for the asgard  they are just too cool .  ,1
still the definitive program about the second world war  the world at war isn  t just long  but also very informative . the series contains   episodes  each episode lasts for about   min .   and includes the events leading up to and following in the wake of the war . most episodes are about the war in europe  and there are several episodes about the war in the pacific . other episodes include information about the wars in africa  burma  the atlantic and the home fronts of germany  great britain  united states and soviet union . there is one episode that  s dedicated to the holocaust . the series starts off with the episode a new germany             and tells about the rise of the nazis in germany and german territorial gains prior to the outbreak of war . the series ends with the episode remember the war  s influence in a post  war world . remember is a fitting episode to end this great program . every episode begins with a short introduction and then with opening credits . the credits are accompanied by a powerful music theme . there are many fitting music pieces throughout the series . each episode is like a mini  film . the footage is fantastic  and so is the way it was put together . in addition  some of the footage is in color . the information included also makes the episodes memorable and entertaining .  br    br   the series was produced by jeremy isaacs for thames television  uk  . commissioned in      it took four years to produce  such was the depth of its research . the series was narrated by laurence olivier  one of the most famous and revered actors of the   th century  . the series interviewed leading members of the allied and axis campaigns  including eyewitness accounts by civilians  enlisted men  officers and politicians  amongst them albert speer  karl donitz  jimmy stewart  bill mauldin  curtis lemay  lord mountbatten  alger hiss  toshikazu kase  arthur harris  charles sweeney  paul tibbets  traudl junge and historian stephen ambrose . jeremy isaacs says in  the making of the world at war  that he sought to interview  not necessarily the surviving big names  but their aides and assistants . the most difficult subject to locate and persuade to be interviewed  according to isaacs  was heinrich himmler  s adjutant  karl wolff . the latter admitted to witnessing a large  scale execution in himmler  s presence .  br    br   the world at war is often considered to be the definitive television history of the second world war . some consider it the finest example of the documentary form . in a list of the    greatest british television programmes drawn up by the british film institute in      voted for by industry professionals  the world at war ranked   th . the program has everything that the viewer needs to know about the war . after watching a few episodes i liked the series so much that i tried to watch the remaining episodes one after the other . i  ve seen some of them several times . there are two other great documentary series that i know of that may be of interest to the viewer . one is called the great war       that  s about world war i . the other is called cold war       that  s about the cold war obviously .  ,1
this is an art film that was either made in     or      the national film preservation foundation says     and imdb says      . regardless of the exact date  the film definitely appears to be very indicative of this general time period   with some camera  work and pop art stylings that are pure late   s  early   s .  br    br   the film consists of three simple images that are distorted using different weird camera tricks . these distorted images are accompanied by music and there is absolutely no dialog or plot of any sort . this was obviously intended as almost like a form of performance art  and like most performance art  it  s interesting at first but quickly becomes tiresome . the film  to put it even more bluntly  is a total bore and would appeal to no one but perhaps those who made the film  their family and friends and perhaps a few people just too hip and  with it  to be understood by us mortals .  ,0
the king maker will doubtless be a success in thailand where the similar  but superior   the legend of suriyothai  set box office records . the film directed by lek kitaparaporn after a screenplay by sean casey based on historical fact in     siam has some amazingly beautiful visual elements but is disarmed by one of the corniest  pedestrian scripts and story development on film .  br    br   the event the picture relates is the arrival of the portuguese soldier of fortune fernando de gamma  gary stretch  whose vengeance for this father  s murderer drives him to shipwrecked  captured and thrown into slavery and put on the bloc in ayutthaya in the kingdom of siam where he is purchased by the beautiful maria  cindy burbridge  with the consent of her father phillipe  john rhys  davies   a man with a name and a past that are revealed as the story progresses . there is a plot to overthrown the king and fernando and his new siamese sidekick tong  dom hetrakul   after some gratuitous cgi enhanced choreographed martial arts silliness  are first rewarded by the king to become his bodyguards  only to be imprisoned together once queen sudachan  yoe hassadeevichit  reveals her plot to kill the king and son to allow her lover lord chakkraphat  oliver pupart  to take over the rule of siam . yet of course fernando and tong escape and are condemned to fight each other to save the lives of their families  tong  s wife and children and fernando  s now firm love affair with maria  with the expected consequences .  br    br   the acting  with the exception of john rhys  davies  is so weak that the film occasionally seems as though it were meant to be camp . the predominantly thai cast struggle with the poorly written dialog  making us wish they had used their native thai with subtitles . the musical score by ian livingstone sounds as though exhumed form old tv soap operas . but if it is visual splendor you  re after there is plenty of that and that alone makes the movie worth watching . it is a film that has obvious high financial backing for all the special effects and masses of cast and sets and shows its good intentions . it is just the basics that are missing . grady harp  ,0
the story of this film is truly remarkable . a virus cut loose and only   of the human race survived . the only thing we know now is that animals rule the land above and there are posters everywhere that say   the twelve monkeys did it .  thats right  the human race had to hide underground from the sickness that had killed over    billion people . apparently animals do not contract this disease . day by day the present scientist try to discover what type of sickness had caused this how it was created if nature did it or a mere human being had created it . all they know is that there is are a bunch of animals running around a city above them  the deaths began during           and twelve monkeys have something to do with it .  or at least thats what the poster says .  so a current convict named james cole  bruce willis  is sent as a  volunteer  to get some samples from above . after he does his  volunteer  work  he is asked to be sent back in time to the year     to figure out what happened to the world . cole accepts and the story of the twelve monkeys begin .  br    br   throughout the story the time machine gets the dates wrong quite a few times  from      to some time during the      s .  in a middle of a war .  throughout the time traveling back and forth  it starts to mess james up in the head and that twist the story up . the whole story is very well done and i would of gave it a higher grade if it wasn  t for the ending . i personally didn  t like the ending of the movie and i was very disappointed . i just was expecting a more explaining ending then what had happen  but it isn  t everyone who thinks this way . so i gave it a   but if everyone had the same opinion as me i would give it a  or  .  br    br   for the whole acting of the film  i give it a a . bruce willis is great for this role and he acts good  but brad pitt is completely     excellent . his acting is so great  he gets into the character so well . i never really cared for brad pitt in till i saw him in this and fight club . there characters or similar in this film  he is just a little more . . . insane in this film . so overall i think this film is completely worth checking out . for most people it  s a great science fiction film  i just don  t think it is a masterpiece .  ,1
this ambitious film suffers most from writer  director paul thomas anderson  s delusions of grandeur . highly derivative of much better material  altman  s  nashville   lumet  s  network    this lumbering elephant takes far too long to get nowhere . a couple of misguided detours along the way  an embarrassing musical interlude  a biblical plague  don  t help matters . neither does the uneven level of performances . especially bad william h . macy  whose character and storyline could easily have been eliminated altogether julianne moore  for her unconvincing angst . and how many times must we see john c . reilly  s sad sack shtick   chicago  and  the hours  will suffice   tom cruise comes off well by comparison  his misogynist  foul  mouthed holy roller was rather amusing . speaking of foul mouths  the script was so loaded with  f  bombs  they lost their impact in no time . don  t even talk about that awful soundtrack  full of insipid and annoying vocals by aimee mann . her extended rendition of  one   a maudlin number to begin with  drove me to distraction at the start of the film . i should have heeded the handwriting on the wall and saved myself three more hours  by which time i  d been pushed to the brink of hell . one redeeming feature  which i haven  t seen mentioned in other reviews  is the best performance in the bunch  by unknown melora walters in the role of claudia  the damaged coke fiend bent on self  destruction . her credibility exceeded all others by far . this film took itself way too seriously and just didn  t know when to end .  ,0
at first i didn  t didn  t like it that much  although i did . they didn  t include the third trueba generation  the love between blanca and pedro wans  t well explained and some actors were too different from what i had imagined .  br    br   later i realized that  had the movie been more loyal to the book  it would have been like five hours long  and would be kind of tedious . now i like it very much  because my favourite characters are there as i portraited them . clara really looks like an angel in live  and her introduction to the story at the beggining of the film was fantastic  loyal and short . glenn close is ferula . i pictured her just like that  only not in mourning throughout the whole thing . esteban is find enough . i never really liked his character  and  although i was interested in him  i hated him a lot  more specially when he hit clara . as in the book  the very last part is the most exciting one  and it has real history too there .  br    br   the movie is really good  specially considering that it was a gringo film based upon a latin american book . its amazing how many famous stars are there  don  t you think so   ,1
if you like star wars  trek  come see where they got all their ideas and cinematic devices . it  s my top  favorite movies of all times  other  worldly  futuristic and psycho  thriller . the intensity of the root material  shakespeare  s  the tempest   is not overshadowed by whizbang gimmickry  a la later lucas  . and just because it was made in      don  t assume you can  see the strings  holding the flying saucer up . this was the first movie where you couldn  t . miracle it was made at  a  movie  scale  economics and tastes at the time were stacked heavily against it . and director wilcox  s previous  hit  was  lassie come home  . until i looked him up  i assumed  fred wilcox  was a pseudonym for a director who was already or later became famous  but at the time didn  t want to be associated with sci  fi  which was strictly a  b  genre back then . this was either a very very visionary production  or a very fortuitous  mistake  on the part of the folks who bankroll hollywood .  br    br   there are the massive  scale mattes with live action almost microscopically inserted that lucas used extensively . there are intelligent machines that transcend the stereotypical  user interface    computers   as they  ve come to be portrayed much less futuristically in later works . star trek  s  transporter  is there  visually  almost unaltered by roddenberry   years later . and if the trek  wars technobabble turns you off  fp  s scientific references are not overdone and are all accurate  even today . the  ship  set is comprehensive  sparklingly realistic  as good as anything you  ve seen since  and more convincing than anything  trek  has done  for tv or film . we didn  t get to spend as much time there as i would have liked .  br    br   if you ever wondered how movies got into space so competently  watching fp will explain all that . it  s definitely not  wagontrain to the stars  .  ,1
renny harlin  s first american film was one of the best of a slew of prison  set horror films  like  death house  or  the chair   in the late    s . twenty years before  guard lane smith had wrongfully executed a condemned man . now  he is the warden of the newly re  opened prison  and the man  s ghost is back for bloody revenge . this atmospheric and very moody film features lots of gruesome gore and violence . viggo mortensen  tiny lister  tom everett and kane hodder are onhand for the entertaining carnage .  ,1
sublimity is the way we have to reach for the beauty . and sublimity is the stuff this film is made of . if not his best  it  s my most loved of all bogdanovich movies .  br    br   this unique masterpiece remind us  as most of the other films from the director  what life is  or should be  about love  lost  or failure  and hope and faith and charity . as the song from whom the films takes its title  gershwin  s well known composition  the film makes the impossible true  and tries to make us aware that no  one is able to judge anybody all this with the lightness of a comedy and the timing of a masterful direction  the first ten minutes  with the detectives following the ladies  almost without a line of dialogue  constructed upon the looks and views of the characters   with that  bogdanovich touch  based on the point  of  view   is a class on cinema language  something that p . b . learned well from his admired directors from the golden age of the movies  . with a superb cast and a glorious soundtrack  including the best of sinatra  s  trilogy    this movie  full of self  consciousness and compassion  and far away from self  indulgence and emptiness  as some critics wrote   deserves a better place on the history of american cinema than where it have been placed . it  s not  long on style  short on substance   it is complex in its simplicity  and beautiful  absolutely beautiful .  ,1
on the     summer blockbuster hit baseketball         this is one of those movies that is usually seen on the big jumbo  tron screen in a sports bar during the day  when everyone is quite drunk . unfortunately  i was sober when i saw this movie .   br    br   so quoted the late gene siskel for this lame  brained  supposed yukfest that came out two weeks after the far superior  there  s something about mary  in a one  upmanship game during july of     .  mary  was a gross  out fest  but in addition to the many gags  it had a lot of heart  which is why it was the highest grossing comedy of that memorable summer .  br    br    baseketball  tried to outdo mary  but it fizzled in more ways that one . you take the creators of  south park   trey parker and matt stone  who are fortunately not behind the movie but in front of the camera  the only member of zaz david zucker helming the picture in desperate need of a paycheck  and the other two jim abrahams and jerry zucker clearly stayed out or probably warned him against the picture  a small bit by now   years young ernest borgnine  wasting his precious time in his distinguished career  dying on a hotdog and singing  i  m too sexy  as he videotapes his will  jenny mccarthy  who has little screen time as borgnine  s not  too  weeping trophy widow young enough to be his granddaughter  a bigger female part by yasmine bleeth as a dedicated social worker whose charges are underprivileged youngsters  and the only interesting and meaningful player in this turkey  robert vaughn as a corrupt archrival  and pointless cameos by  airplane   alumni kareem abdul jabaar and the late robert stack who seemed nostalgic for the     masterpiece and it  s much fresher humor created by the zaz family . what do all these people make up  a desperate cast and crew trying to replicate  airplane   humor and mixing it up with the crudity of  south park   but failing in every way .  br    br   to make this long     minute movie short   baseketball   a real game invented by david zucker and his friends in his hometown of milwaukee  is about two lazy losers  parker and stone  and their pint  sized mutual friend who invent baseball and basketball  hence the title  together on the driveway of one  s house . after borgnine dies  he bequeaths the ownership of his baseketball team  the milwaukee beers to parker and stone . sure enough  the game goes national  and archrivals vaughn and mccarthy want to take away ownership of the beers team from them . but bleeth is in love with both men  particularly parker  and one poor  sick charge in need of a liver transplant goes ga  ga over them . those are the characters  not strongly developed .  br    br   now witless gags ensue . blood  electroshock hair  egg  throwing and screaming are among them . parker and stone nearly kill the youngster in the hospital  but he pulls through the liver transplant . borgnine sings and rubs ointment on his chest in the videotaped will . mccarthy  who seemed to get over borgnine  s death by choking on a frank right away  quickly massages vaughn in the next scene . cheerleaders dance in skimpy outfits . there is plenty of music on the soundtrack that is played for the hard of hearing . and david zucker forces the parodies of  riverdance  and  titanic .  parody forcing is nothing new to zaz  post  airplane   and  the naked gun  series .  br    br   and like siskel  i was sober as well  but i was also getting sleepy . this movie should be played over and over to coarse  mannered barroom patrons who enjoy it as they chug down beers  but will they remain alert and awake  or pass out during the unfunny parts  if they pass out  then they won  t realize that they are luckily missing stupidity and absurdity . hats off to them   ,0
the movie opens upon julian sands  lying on his back  a black kitten drooling blood into his awaiting mouth from where he holds it  about two feet above him . that was so provocative  and i thought   here we go  a good vampire movie    br    br   and then it died . that was literally the only scene which captured any part of the imagination . it was slow  uneventful drivel thereafter . i was vastly disappointed  as my previous experience with sands  acting was quite enjoyable . however  this attempt was obviously misdirected and the screenplay left a lot to be desired .  br    br   even julian sands  s questionable performance could not begin to save this already sunken barge of a movie .  br    br   it rates a  .     from . . .  br    br   the fiend  .  ,0
barbra streisand is a tour de force in this hollywood story . her performances and the songs are one  of  a  kind and are special in the halls of great movies . the scene where she is introduced to the unexpecting audience by kristopherson  against the crowds  wishes and hers  only to turn them around with her magnificent performance of  woman in the moon  is one of the best examples on film of how well a great performer can win over an audience . it  s real . the scene where she records evergreen ranks with the best in the business . . all live  no lip  sync  very special . streisand is often criticized for being a diva  but she delivers on this one . she is majestic singing  with one more look at you . she deserved the oscar she and paul williams got for evergreen . kristopherson had his moments too  far above most of his movie appearances . this version of the  born  franchise ranks with the first one of      janet gaynor  frederic march  although i will always enjoy judy garland and james mason musical remake of     . i haven  t seen the dvd yet and don  t know about its quality .  ,1
i went to see vanilla sky with a huge  huge  huge   . . tom cruise fan  my extremely cynical brother and my girlfriend . . . what can i say . . i was totally blown away by the movie and especially tc  s performance  i thought it was a very moving film and it was not at all what i was expecting .  br    br   i had read the reviews and had decided not to go and see it  i am so pleased that i was  coerced  into seeing it . the strange thing is i cannot say why  all i can say is that i found it totally involving and could not stop thinking about it the next day . as to what i felt about the film  all i can say about is  its not the storyline  fantasy  psychodrama  whatever  its about the people and the events that shape their life and how small events  like getting into a car can change everything . . . . . .  br    br   as to what the critics wrote  yes maybe the original was a stunning  nd film for alejandro amenbar  but this was a totally different interpretation of the subject  and by no means a narcissistic remake for the benefit of tom cruise and penelope cruz .  br    br   i cannot even consider writing a couple of trite  glib sentences to describe the film just go and see it      br    br   yes i know this isn  t a balanced thoughtful review but so what . it  s not that kind of film .  ,1
the acting  fantastic . the story  amazing . the script  wonderful .  br    br   just a few ways to describe this movie . yes  it  s slow and it has mostly talking  but the whole story of all of their lives and how it  s told with the flashbacks thrown in and out makes you want to listen to every little thing to learn more about this haunting and tragic story . i  myself  am reading the book that the movie is based off of and it has shown me even more light into this story and answers some questions that were left unanswered in the movie . i  m also to read the exectioner  s song  which is the  other  half of the gilmore story . this movie made me think so much about the phrase  piering into the other side of the looking glass  . you hear a song in the movie called gary gilmore  s eyes  which is by a punk band that wrote a song about what it  d be like to have gary gilmore  s eyes  which is one of the things gary gave as a transplant when he died  and as you listen to it  which is after the last time mikal ever sees gary  you look at the whole situation a little differently if you were to only here the song itself . this movie opened my eyes in that way and in many others . i recommend this movie  and the book  very very much .  ,1
this movie is just truly awful  the eye  candy that plays ben just can make up for everything else that is wrong with this movie .  br    br   the writer  director  producer  lead actor etc probably had a good idea to create a movie dealing with the important issues of gay marriage  family acceptance  religion  homophobia  hate crimes and just about every other issue effecting a gay man of these times  but trying to ram every issue into such a poorly conceived film does little justice to any of these causes .  br    br   the script is poor  the casting very ordinary  but the dialogue and acting is just woeful . the homo  hating brother is played by the most camp actor and there is absolutely no chemistry between the two lead actors  i think i  ve seen more passion in an corn flakes ad  . the acting is stiff  and the dialogue forced  a scene where the brother is feeding the detective his lines was the highlight  .  br    br   i  m just pleased to see that the creator of this train wreck has not pushed any other rubbish out in to distribution  and if he is thinking of doing so  i have some advise  just don  t do it .  ,0
i couldn  t tell if  the screaming skull  was trying to be a hitchcock rip off or a modernized edgar allen poe tribute . these days  someone would have chopped it up a bit and presented it as one of those tv anthology episodes from the old  tales from the dark side  . . . but only after an extensive rewrite .  br    br   the sad thing is  there seems to be a nice  nasty little story trying to get out from under the rubble of this movie  and the actors are obviously doing the best they can with both their talent and the material they have to work with . but the director just didn  t know how to stage or pace a dramatic scene the special effects simply didn  t work the screenplay telegraphed its threadbare plot points so plainly that a bivalve could have seen them coming and the soundtrack kept playing german  oompah band  music when it was supposed to be trying to scare the audience .  br    br   they tried they tried really hard . but this is of interest only as a period piece . i suppose someone very young who hadn  t seen a lot of suspense or horror might get a charge out  the screaming skull   but someone that young probably wouldn  t get most of the subtext or plot motivation .   mommy  why is that nice man trying to scare the twisty faced scaredy  cat lady      ,0

the definition of an abomination as defined by webster  s dictioary is  a cause of abhorrence or disgust .  if someone can think of a more appropriate word or definition than this for alone in the dark  please let me know because this is the best i can come up with . however  i do no feel that in anyway this word describes how truly awful this film is .  br    br   i went to see this film with two of my roommates . one has very similar tastes to me  the other is an action  adventure flick guru . this latter guy usually doesn  t care about the size of the plot holes  as long as the movie contains lots of explosions he will walk away satisfied .  br    br   that being said we entered the theater for the friday viewing of alone in the dark . little to my surprise we were the only people in the theater . when it started i knew why immediately .  br    br   it begins with the worst opening scene of any movie  and unfortunately i have to admit it only gets worse from there . the opening scene is a  minute scroll text that is narrated . yet  i understand why it was narrated . the director must have understood that only illiterate people would even ascertain the thought of paying to see this movie . yet  not only is this first scene the longest scroll text in the history of cinema  but it also makes no sense . it seems as if in the same sequence we are hearing about to completely separate movies . one is about an ancient civilization and its tampering with a portal  the other is about a crazy scientist and his experiments on orphans . if you are reading this and are confused  you are not alone .  br    br   then the awful storyline  acting  effects  and camera work begin . tara reid is horrendous as an actress . she does nothing to even for one second make you think that she is a museum curator . slater is just bad  not convincing  and has no chemistry with reid .  br    br   the plot is probably the worst thing ever created by man . the entire time myself and the roommate with similar tastes are asking questions like what is this  and what is going on  other than this scrolling garbage we have a few narrated sequences by slater himself . are they good  no . do they explain anything  no . do we at any point as an audience have the slightest inkling as to why we should care what happens  once again  no .  br    br   then we have a random sex scene . we are told that slater and reid are together  yet at no time do they act as though they even care about on another . but then bam . . . sex scene . once again i don  t know .  br    br   a good  oh i don  t know    seconds after that woeful scene ends we have a gunfight with   or so military and a similar number of alien things . this is set to a heavy  metal track and causes more brain hemorrhaging than one ever thought possible .  br    br   and if that wasn  t enough . . .  br    br   there exists no main villain . there is the scientist and there are the  alien  things . at one point the scientist controls the alien things and stands on a hill commanding them to attack the military outpost . why  how did he become the supreme commander of these things  why do they listen to him  once again i have no idea .  br    br   the movie ends with slater and reid walking in an evacuated city . why was the city evacuated  did the alien things break through  did the military tell them  who knows . . . and by this point who cares  i didn  t and you won  t .  br    br   but to top it off  slater and reid are attacked by an alien thing . even though it was stated that alien things will be killed by exposure to sunlight . and thats right  you guessed it  it the middle of the ing day and it  s bright as can be . maybe the alien thing bought a pair of sunglasses  i don  t know and i don  t care .  br    br   now after the movie ended i ran outside the theater  all  foot  inches of me  waving my arms and shaking my afro telling everyone not to go see this movie . even my gung  ho action  adventure roommate  who would consider a movie that just cut and pasted  hours of explosion into  film to be the greatest thing ever created  admitted that plot holes were very evident in this film .  br    br   to sum up this crap  fest i give it a  .     and would give it lower if i could .  br    br   unequivocally  the worst movie ever made . i wouldn  t wish this movie on my worst enemy .  ,0
i had eagerly awaited the first screening of this film ever since it was given to me on dvd at christmas . having reserved a special slot for it last night  i sat down to watch it with my daughter  aged   and a film studies student   with chocolates of course  in eager anticipation . we love jane austin .  br    br   after just the first two minutes we knew we were sunk . the shaky camera shots and angles  general poor cinematography  direction and wooden performances had already left us feeling flat and dissatisfied . despondent  we viewed on .  br    br   anne  played by sally hawkins  looked oddly and with no particular purpose  directly at the camera on several occasions  breaking our hard  won  fantasy of the moment  and engaging us directly in an almost  i  ll find you  stalking fashion .  br    br   poor rupert penry  jones  who played captain wentworth  did his best with the script and direction  bless him . i hope they paid him well  however  as he was practically drowned on one occasion by a huge wave which predictably breached the seawall  drenching him and his co  actor . they were nearly swept out to sea . health and safety would have had a field day  poor rupert was left spitting out sea water in order to deliver his line . presumably there was not enough money left in the kitty for a re  shoot of this scene . anyone with any sense would have not attempted it on such a day in the first place .  br    br   other than mr . penry  jones  alice krige gave the only convincing performance as lady russell but her efforts were soon counterbalanced by those of anthony head  s unconvincing portrayal of annoying sir walter elliott .  br    br   towards the long  awaited end of the film  captain wentworth appeared to oddly grace anne with a visit every two seconds having taken great pains to avoid her for the majority of the movie . it was as if he had developed a memory impediment which caused him to forget his very reason for being . in contrast  anne ran  hyper  ventilating  from pillar to post in search of the good captain who  in the meantime  had managed to call upon almost the entirety of bath we are told  in the course of only three or four minutes  without even having worked up a sweat .  br    br   we experienced none of anne  s charms crossing the screen . indeed  we were left wondering what charismatic captain wentworth had ever seen in plain  spineless  opinion  less anne and why someone  anyone  did not tell mean  winging sir walter to just shut the heck up .  br    br   the crucial kiss  normally our favourite girlie moment  was painfully drawn out . as they moved in closer  anne kept opening and closing her mouth which had the effect on screen of making her look as if she were chewing gum before lips finally met . eww   br    br   the most enjoyable thing about last night was the chocolates and the half hour exchange of views between mother and daughter on just how bad the film had been .  br    br   what a pity to ruin such an enchanting and engaging story  filmed in some of england  s finest scenery .  br    br   sorry jane .  ,0
i was thirteen years old  when i saw this movie . i expected a lot of action . since escape from new york was    rated in germany i entered the movie as fallback . it was so boring . afterwards i realized that this was just crap where a husband exhibits his wife . i mean today you do this via internet and you pay for instant access . it is more then   years ago  but i am still angry that i waste my time with this film . this is a soft  porno for schoolboys . undressing bo derek and painting her with color  nice . but then they should named the film undressing bo and painting her .  ,0
unhinged was part of the video nasty censorship film selection that the uk built up in the    s . keeps the gory stuff out of the hands of children  don  t you know  it must have left many wondering what the fuss was all about . by today  s standard  unhinged is a tame little fairy tale .  br    br    girls are off to a jazz concert . . . and right away  you know the body count is going to be quite low . they get lost in the woods   wind up getting in a car accident that looks so fake it  s laughable . they are picked up by some nearby residents that live in the woods in a creepy house . one of the girls is seriously injured and has to stay upstairs . then there  s talking . talking about why the girls are here  and how they must be to dinner on time because mother doesn  t like it when someone is late . and more talking . yakkity yak . some suspense is built as a crazy guy is walking around and harassing the girls  and someone  s eyeball is looking through holes in the walls at the pretty girls in something that looks like hitchcock  s psycho . i digress because there is so much blah blah in this film  that you wonder when the killings are going to start . in fact  one of the girls gets so bored out of her mind that she walks in the woods  alone  looking for the town . smart move . she probably knew about the lonely virgin walking alone in the woods part  but just didn  t care . more talk continues after this as we wait  wait  and wait some more until the next girl may or may not be killed .  br    br   and then there  s the twist ending . the  expected  unexpected for some viewers  for others a real gotcha . quite possibly the only reason why someone would really want to watch this . i don  t care how twisted it is  nothing in this movie makes up for the most boring time i had watching it . even with the minor impact of the ending  the director just didn  t have what it takes to really deliver a good story with it . it would have made a much better   minute   hour tv episode on say  tales from the darkside .  br    br   if you really must get this for any reason  perhaps just to say you  ve watched every slasher movie  do yourself a favor and have the fast  forward button ready . since the movie has so many unimportant scenes  just zoom through them  and in no time  you  ll get to the  wow  that  s what it was all this time  ending . oh and halfway through the movie there  s a shower scene with  girls showing boo  bees . horray for boo  bees . those beautiful buzzing honey  making boo  bees .  ,0
this is one of the best bond games i have ever played because  br    br   the missions are very very fun to play they have lots of action in them they can be really hard sometimes that makes it even more fun the weapons that you use are really good . the cars in this game are really good the driving missions are fun to do . this james bond game has a good story to it . the voice over actors in this game are really good and it is cool that pierce brosnan is in this game and the way the characters look is really good because they look like what they look like in real life which is really cool . also the graphics in this game pretty good .  br    br   overall score  out of   ,1
although i really enjoyed jim carrey  s latest  serious  performances   the truman show    man on the moon    i  ve always thought his real genious lies in physical comedy . this is not to say he is a fantastic  talented actor those bozos at the academy awards seem to dislike him so much  he has never had a  truly deserved  nomination or award . well  any  institution  that nominates for   oscars a bore such as  titanic  shouldn  t be taken seriously .  br    br   on with the review .  the grinch  is the sweetest  best looking  best acted  more enjoyable seasons film since  the nightmare before christmas  . both movies seem very similar  too  with their highly stylized sets and the premise of someone stealing christmas . both make their principal actors seem like the villains  one in a higher degree than the other   both pack a strong moral lesson  and both are truly enjoyable .  br    br   that is  until you realize that jack skellington is a doll  and the grinch is a human being . but a human being that is so incredibly expressive  so fluid in his movements  so cartoon  like  so unreal  that never gets in the way of the movie . he can be hilarious  he can be a sad soul  he can be angry . he lives in a   dimensional world  where   dimensional people live . he jokes  he laughs  he cries  and ultimately he saves the christmas . i loved this film to bits  and cannot wait for it to come out on dvd . this is one of those films you will really enjoy      years from now . as timeless as they come .  ,1
is there anything worse than a comedy film that lacks humor  the answer is yes one that fails to generate any interest throughout the picture . the premise is not too bad  a naive front man for an illegal business  but this is a potboiler with a poor script and screenplay and just does not work .  br    br   was this considered a good  b  in      hard to imagine . the only positive aspect of the picture is the cast  which contains several well  known faces from the     s and     s  such as warren hymer  vince barnett and robert armstrong  i always dismiss richard cromwell as the weakling who got gary cooper killed in  lives of a bengal lancer   so i wasn  t counting him  .  br    br   can  t recommend this one and gave it a rating of   if you have a choice  get a root canal .  ,0

i think this movie was probably a lot more powerful when it first debuted in      though nowadays it seems a bit too preachy and static to elevate it to greatness . the film is set in       just before the entry of the us into the war . paul lukas plays the very earnest and decent head of his family . he  s a german who has spent seven years fighting the nazis and avoiding capture . bette davis is his very understanding and long  suffering wife who has managed to educate and raise the children without him from time to time . as the film begins  they are crossing the border from mexico to the usa and for the first time in years  they are going to relax and stop running .  br    br   the problem for me was that the family was too perfect and too decent   making them seem like obvious positive propaganda instead of a real family suffering through real problems . while this had a very noble goal at the time  it just seems phony today . in particular  the incredibly odd and extremely scripted dialog used by the children just didn  t ring true . it sounded more like anti  fascism speeches than the voices of real children . they were as a result extremely annoying   particularly the littlest one who came off  at times  as a brat . about the only ones who sounded real were bette davis and her extended american family as well as the scumbag romanian living with them  though he had no discernible accent  .  br    br   it  s really tough to believe that the ultra  famous dashiel hammett wrote this dialog  as it just doesn  t sound true to life . the story was based on the play by his lover  lillian hellman . and  the basic story idea and plot is good  . . . but the dialog is just bad at times . overall  an interesting curio and a film with some excellent moments  . . . but that  s really about all .  ,1
i cannot believe how uneducated this movie is . it  s like watching police academy  except it  s with people that have no clue of what they are talking about  and . . . wait  there is a stupid robot that is supposed to be a sidekick . i can understand suspension of disbelief  but this is just complete stupidity . not only is there no plot to this movie . it  s like watching someone that pretends to be a doctor  throw non  medical words around as if they were chief of staff at a major medical facility . plus the people are wearing clothes that are un  befitting for a space program . i feel like i  m watching a valley  girls  b  movie  in space .  ,0
popeye and big foot  popeye  s engine company  getting popeye  s goat      br    br   i used to lap these up as a kid but  catching an episode of the series comprising three cartoons back  to  back now i . e . several years later  they preceded the theatrical screening of the pirate yarn raiders of the seven seas         i can see how they don  t hold up all that well  the character of popeye isn  t exactly sympathetic to begin with  olive oyl distinctly overbearing and bluto  s antics failed to elicit much interest either  in short  the scripts were alarmingly thin  fairly awful and generally unfunny to boot . they  re strictly juvenile fare  yet i doubt today  s kids would even have the patience to stick with them   furthermore  the animation style is unattractive .  br    br   taking each short per se  i guess they improved from one to the other after the initial shock  one adapted to its mediocre quality as it were  so that the third cartoon easily results in being the most enjoyable of the lot  popeye is entrusted with a mascot army goat whose immense appetite causes him no end of mischief  hardly original  i know  but always an amusing ploy  . one interesting element here was that the shorts were bookended with popeye delivering moralistic bits of wisdom to the kids in the audience .  ,0
darkwolf tells the tale of a young waitress named josie  samaire armstrong  who had been leading a pretty ordinary life until her friend mary  tippi hedren  is killed by a werewolf  you see werewolves actually exist in modern day america  there is even a special organisation within the police force to fight the werewolf threat headed up by detective steve turley  ryan olosio  who has the difficult task of telling josie that she is in fact a pure blooded werewolf herself  that a so  called  dark prince  werewolf  kane hodder  wants to mate with her  create a new breed of pure blood werewolves that will take over the entire world  or something like that . understandably josie has a hard time believing it  that is until she sees the evidence with her own eyes . it  s up to werewolf cop steve to save josie  the day  the world . . .  br    br   co  executive produced  directed richard friedman i thought darkwolf was a pretty bad low budget shot on a digital camcorder horror film that didn  t really do anything for me . the script by geoffrey alan holliday starts out promisingly enough being set in a strip club with plenty of naked breasts on show  then there  s a werewolf attack which leaves someone splattered everywhere but after this decent opening sequence it  s pretty much down hill all the way i  m afraid . for a start it  s slow going  it  s dull  it  s predictable  it  s populated with highly annoying character  s who come out with lots of bad dialogue  do stupid things like when they have the opportunity to shoot the werewolf they don  t  i have no idea why but they prefer to just stand there instead . the script is dumb  doesn  t explain itself  why has josie never turned into a werewolf before  is she really the only one  why can  t this  dark prince  find another female werewolf  there are also lots of other things which make little or no sense like an ancient book which at fist seems quite important but is then totally forgotten about half  way through but you get the idea anyway  as a whole the film plods along in very linear fashion to a very predictable climatic showdown that is underwhelming to say the least .  br    br   director friedman lights the film quite well with bright neon but this is noting new or original  doesn  t really improve the film as a spectacle . now let  s talk special effects or rather the lack of them because the effects in darkwolf are far from special  the werewolf transformation is achieved using cgi  it  s among the worst looking cgi i  ve ever seen  seriously a playstation would be embarrassed about these computer graphics . it  s easily the worst werewolf transformation i  ve ever seen  an american werewolf in london       was made over   years ago yet the special effects in that are literally light  years ahead of the ones seen in darkwolf  who says special effects have improved over the years  the animatronic puppet effects aren  t much better either although at least there  s something psychical on screen . the gore isn  t up to much after a gory opening kill there  s some blood splatter  plenty of dead bodies but not much else . thre  s a fair amount of female nudity if that  s your thing but don  t get too excited because you still have to sit through a terrible film to see it  is it really worth it   br    br   technically darkwolf is alright apart from possibly the worst cgi effect ever  it  s reasonably well made  it at least seems to have production values . the acting is what you  d expect really .  br    br   darkwolf is yet another low budget piece of crap horror film that litter video shop shelves  clutter the schedules of obscure cable tv stations  i didn  t think it was as bad as some but it  s like saying going to the dentist is slightly more fun than going to a funeral although when all said  done they  re both horrible still . . .  ,0
daniel day  lewis does a remarkable job of playing christy brown  the artist who grew up with cerebral palsy but managed to have a productive life  dealing successfully with his handicap and becoming a respected artist and writer .  br    br   the film  however  is a very difficult one to review   or even watch . fortunately  i had the caption feature on to catch every spoken word which would have been impossible if i saw the film in a theater . while i respect it as a brave piece of work dealing with difficult subject matter  i can  t say it  s the sort of film i  d want to view more than once .  br    br   nevertheless  my attention was held by the story  telling device  a flashback framed by the present  in which we see christy being honored for his achievements before we see the flashback to his youth and his struggles to communicate with those around him  who certainly gave him loving care .  br    br   daniel day  lewis certainly is remarkable as the troubled man who falls in love with a therapist  fiona shaw   much to his mother  s fear that when the love is not reciprocated his heart will be broken . there  s a painfully long scene in a restaurant where he confesses his love to her before others and then goes into a frenzied rage after drinking too much .  br    br   brenda fricker does a brilliant job as the mother taking care of him  his father and a brood of siblings while struggling to keep a roof over their heads until day  lewis begins to have success with his work . she complements day  lewis  performance as the warm  hearted mother and shares many poignant moments with him .  br    br   richly detailed story of a family that stayed together under the most unusual of circumstances with attention to period detail in every frame of the film . both fricker and day  lewis won oscars  but hugh o  conor and ray mcanally are also excellent . o  conor is christy as a boy and mcanally is the father who spends too much time at the local pub but loves the boy .  br    br   summing up elmer bernstein  s music is an added plus factor . well worthwhile  but definitely not a film for everyone .  ,1
few movies have dashed expectations and upset me as much as fire has . the movie is pretentious garbage . it does not achieve anything at an artistic level . the only thing it managed to receive is a ban in india . if only it was because of the poor quality of film making rather than the topical controversy  the ban would have been more justifiable .  br    br   now that i  ve got my distress out of my system  i am more able to analyse the movie  br    br    from the onset the movie feels unreal especially when the protagonists start conversing in english . the director  of course  did not make the movie for an indian audience however it underestimated its international audiences by over simplifying it . watching the character of the domestic help conversing in perfect english is too unreal to be true .  br    br    next we get regular glimpses into radha  s dreams . these scenes are not very effective . they coming up as jarring and obstruct the flow of the movie . i  m still wondering how that philosophical dialogue connected to the story . i felt that the surrealism was lost .  br    br    the love scenes felt voyeuristic and are probably meant for audience titillation rather than being a powerful statement . in any case  they do not achieve either of the two .  br    br    the names chosen for the women  radha and sita  are names of hindu deities and hence been selected to shock the audiences . however  since the film wasn  t meant for indian audiences in the first place  the shock  through  name  selection is not meant to achieve its goal  which is absurd .  br    br    the quality of direction is very poor and some key and delicate scenes have been poorly handled . a better director could have made a powerful emotional drama out of the subject .  br    br    the acting felt wooden although nandita das brought some life into the role  the others were wasted . i always thought that shabana azmi was a good actress but her talent is not evident in this film . the male leads were outright rubbish .  br    br   in case you are a fan of earth and wish to see more of the director  stay away from this one . please .  ,0
the last hunt is the forgotten hollywood classic western . the theme of genocide via buffalo slaughter is present in other films but never so savagely . robert taylor  s against  type role as the possessed buffalo and indian killer is his finest performance .  br    br   in the     s  your mom dropped you and your friends off at the saterday matine  usually featuring a western or comedy . but it was wrong then and now to let a youngster watch psycho  dramas like the searchers and the last hunt . let the kids wait a few years before exposing them to films with repressed sexual sadism and intense racial hatred .  br    br   why did mom fail to censor these films  because they featured  safe  hollywood stars like taylor and john wayne . but the climatic scene in the last hunt is as horrifying as vincent price  s mutation in the fly .  br    br   the mythology of the white buffalo  part of the texture of this movie  was later ripped  off by other movies including the white buffalo  starring charles bronson as wild bill hickock . the laugh here is that bronson used to play indians .  br    br   today a large remnant bison herd resides in yellowstone national park in wyoming . in the winter  hunger forces surplus animals out of the park into montana  where they are sometimes harvested by idaho  s nez perce indians under a us treaty right that pre  dates the lincoln presidency . linclon signed the congressional act which authorized the continental railroad and started the buffalo slaughter .  ,1

the person who wrote the review  enough with the sweating and spitting already  has no grasp of what cultural  literary  or psycho  critique is . he dismisses zizek  s interpretations because they don  t seem  in line  with what the director originally intended . so what  the importance of a director  s  or author  s  intention is not important in critical theory . this is known as the author  s  intentional fallacy  and should be avoided .  br    br   http   en . wikipedia . org  wiki  intentional  fallacy a text or movie can be analyzed through a number of theories  many of which disagree with one another  as well as completely ignore the author  s intention . this is the most fundamental idea of critical theory .  br    br   because of this  whoever wrote that wall of text wasted a lot of time and effort on insulting zizek . in reality  anyone who studies theory would immediately discredit this guys opinion  i suggest you should too  as it is completely off point .  br    br   that being said . . . if you are at all interested in freudian  laconian  or kristevian discourse  this movie is a must . it connects these theories with popular film  making them much more palpable and enjoyable than simply reading or thinking about them .  ,1

jennifer jason leigh and mare winningham are a good match portraying vastly different siblings  but only winningham is able to bring something convincing or substantial to her role . leigh  playing bar  band singer and alcoholic sadie flood  constantly leans on older sis georgia  an acclaimed folk singer in the joni mitchell mold . perhaps due to her double duties as co  producer on the film  leigh seems to have boxed herself into a corner she isn  t credible as a singer and  even if this is intentional  gives herself far too much screen  time at the microphone . probably hoping for a tour  de  force  leigh is wire  drawn and nervous and jagged however  we simply do not see any talent within this character  leigh is obviously a solid actress  but she makes decisions here that wall us off from her  . if sadie had even the slightest bit of charisma or appeal  we might be able to buy into the concept that she gets the  small  breaks that she does . as it is  the likelihood of her ever getting up on stage is slim . director ulu grosbard crafts a few intense dramatic sequences  and the editing at the finale juxtaposes sadie  s bar performance with georgia  s sold  out arena show   both singing the same song   and it  s a sadly nuanced moment . . . but really  what  s the point      from   ,0
this is the best movie i  ve ever seen   br    br   maybe it  s because i live just a few miles from the village were the story take place  and i know how things work out in this area in sweden . the movie tells the truth  believe me  it both criticizes and honors the lifestyle of dalarna  and the producer wants people who watch the movie to be more opened minded and care more for your closest friends and relatives .  br    br   but if you live in another small village anywhere in sweden  or another country  you will probably also recognize much from this movie .  br    br   thank you maria blom   ,1
this is a movie that should be seen by everyone if you want to see great acting . mr . torn and ms farrel do an outstanding job . i think they should have it on tv again so a new audience can enjoy it . wonderful performances .  br    br   it gives you a real feel of what the pioneers had to go through both physically and emotionally . great unheard of movie .  br    br   it was done when ms . farrel was very young . i had always thought of her as a comedian  but this certainly is not a comedy and she is just wonderful . there is very little dialogs  but that just make it seem more real . mr . torn as always is a great presence and just his breathing has great feeling . i must see movie .  ,1
this is a great movie . it has a captivating story  an awesome main character  very good acting and killer action . this takes place mostly in the year     but shows scenes that take place in past years to explain the story .  br    br   the story is very well done and there are no holes . kurt russell is a solider named todd who is trained from birth to kill and like all of the other soldiers have never had normal lives . eventually the military introduces newer  younger  faster and stronger soldiers . jason scott lee being one of them . as a result they don  t have any need for the old soldiers like todd . they test out the new soldiers by having them fight some of the old soldiers  in the battle russell is injured and assumed to be dead . the military dumps his body as well as a fewer others assuming they are all dead but what they don  t realize is that russell is alive .  br    br   todd finds a camp filled with civilization on this planet that the military dumped him on . for a while he lives there but can  t adjust to normal life . he rarely says a word and he is at times very aggressive towards the other people . when they feel he is a danger to them they send him off to the desert .  br    br   just as russell  s leaving the planet is attacked by the new soldiers . what the military forgot was to train the soldiers to be smart like todd and the other old soldiers . so while these new soldiers are faster and stronger than todd  todd easily outsmarts them . the military starts realizing this and todd kills all of their men but one . that one is jason scott lee and in the end you see a classic fight scene between russell and scott lee . russell obviously comes out on top .  br    br   this is one of the best action films i  ve ever seen and i  ve seen a lot . this has everything you could ask for in a film including some great lines . the writer also didn  t forget that russell had never seen a woman before as he calls even women  sir  . there are no holes in this film  every minute has a purpose and it  s very entertaining .  br    br   an awesome one man army action film for fans of rambo  commando and missing in action . this is highly recommended for all kurt russell fans and action  sci  fi fans .  ,1

the film begins with people on earth discovering that their rocket to mars had not been lost but was just drifting out in space near out planet . when it  s retrieved  one of the crew members is ill  one is alive and the other two are missing . what happened to them is told through a flashback by the surviving member .  br    br   while on mars  the crew was apparently attacked by a whole host of very silly bug  eyed monsters . oddly  while the sets were pretty good  the monsters were among the silliest i have seen on film . plus  in an odd attempt at realism  the production used a process called  cinemagic  . unfortunately  this wonderful innovation just made the film look pretty cheap when they were on the surface of mars and the intensity of the redness practically made my eyes bleed   it was that bad   despite all the cheese  the film did have a somewhat interesting plot as well as a good message about space travel . for lovers of the genre  it  s well worth seeing . for others  you may just find the whole thing rather silly   see for yourself and decide .  br    br   while by today  s standards this isn  t an especially good sci  fi film  compared with the films being made at the time  it stacks up pretty well .  br    br   ps   when you watch the film  pay careful attention to dr . tremayne . he looks like the spitting image of dr . quest from the  jonny quest  cartoon  plus  he sounds and acts a lot like him  too .  ,0
the sun should set on this movie  forever .  br    br   it goes on forever  which isn  t usually a bad thing  the english patient  schindler  s list  but is so tedious . the aging of the actors is unbelievable and so is the drawn  out never  ending story line which really seems to go nowhere .  br    br   in short  a waste of talent and film .  ,0
it ran  seasons  but it  s first  in early      and it  s last  in the autumn of      were shorter than seasons    . cbs chief william paley canceled rawhide  s production after watching the  st show of season   in september       because he disliked the series without eric fleming as gil favor  who had departed after season  . the last new episode aired in november      . the lone     cbs broadcast  on january        was a rerun .  br    br   i have often wondered why rawhide didn  t switch to color filming for it  s last season  most of the big westerns of the     s had gone over to color by     . cbs was broadcasting in color that autumn  for many of their sitcoms  but westerns like gunsmoke and rawhide remained in black and white . gunsmoke was the last western  and last prime time network series to switch to color  on september         for the episode snap decision .  ,1
rented the movie as a joke . my friends and i had so much fun laughing at it that i went and found a used copy and bought it for myself . now when all my friends are looking for a funny movie i give them sasquatch hunters . it needs to be said though there is a rule that was made that made the movie that much better . no talking is allowed while the movie is on unless the words are sasquatch repeated in a chant . i loved the credit at the end of the movie as well .  thanks for the jeep  tom   whoever tom is i say thank you because without your jeep the movie may not have been made . in short a great movie if you are looking for something to laugh at . if you want a good movie maybe look for something else but if you don  t mind a laugh at the expense of a man in a monkey suit grab yourself a copy .  ,1
i know no one cares  but i do . this film is historic for one reason . it is the unity of two heroes from two great seventies sci  fi films . well  one is great  and one is quite bad . the great one is truly great  in fact it  s the best . the bad one is truly bad  in fact it  s the worst . of course of the great i refer to  star wars  and it  s star mark hamill  aka  luke skywalker   who is the hero of this film about a kid who gets his vette swiped and then goes to vegas  on a lead  and after a whole lot of adventures  eventually recovers it .  since he  s into fixing cars i guess you can call him  lube skywalker   . along the way he meets a hooker with a heart of gold  and ends up facing off with a character played by kim milford  the hero from the seventies sci  fi cult film  laserblast   which is  as i  ve hinted at earlier  the worst sci  fi film ever made . milford plays the lead baddie whom hamill must steal his car back from . i realize that no one cares about this meeting of two great sci  fi heroes  but i do . and i also must say that this is one of the best  worst movies of all time . mark hamill  s acting needs the force  the plot needs extensive jedi training  and the character of the hooker played by annie potts just might be the most annoying character of all time  ever  in any film i  ve ever seen . but it  s a fun movie to watch on a weekend day  or a weekday night  late at night  very late . it  s one of those films that meanders  looking for something but without quite finding it and yet  at the same time  it  s entire purpose is  like free  form jazz  to simply exist as is . and it does . and what is  isn  t that great  but you can  t say it isn  t entertaining  because for an hour and a half you might feel ripped off  but you won  t feel cheated . so turn off your mind  relax  and enjoy this muddled gem without any expectations  and may the force be with you  always .  ,0
what this movie fails from answering is how wrong this war is  and most us wars recently made only to get some oil  .  br    br   how many innocent civilian casualties there has been  how many lives perished and how blatantly stupid the perpetrators are .  br    br   so  let me ask you  if american soldier kills women and children apart from enemy  its ok  but if government accidentally kills their own forces by deadly chemicals while killing many civilians as well  it is not  your logic fails  gentleman .  br    br   i  ll give it  for the solid performance and  to everything else   in total .  ,0
always enjoy great films which deal with the super  natural and the deep thoughts of the spiritual world . however  this film just turned me off as far as its production and direction . there is nothing to go into deep discussion about what this story has to tell all i can say is that it was a big waste of time and effort to put it on the big screen . the actors  namely mark addy  thomas garrett  gave an outstanding performance in his native land england  and we have seen him in  still standing  a tv series . heath ledger  played the real wicked dude and we have recently viewed him in  brokeback mountain       gave a great supporting role . shannyn sossaman   mara sinclair   did a good job of seducing a priest from a church not recognized by any faith . don  t waste your time  you will be sorry   ,0
i couldn  t find anyone to watch dig  with me because no one i knew was a fan of either of the bands . naturally everyone assumed you can only enjoy this film if you like the music of either the dandy warhols or the brian jonestown massacre  but this is so far from the truth . the only requirement is that you have an interest in music and  or pop culture in general . the way in which the careers of the two groups are paralleled is a perfect representation of the paths a band can take  and watching the public eat up and spit out the dandy warhols is fascinating . i agree with other reviews that mention it would be nice to get a final word from anton himself  since he  s clearly depicted as his own worst enemy and the bulwark to the band  s ability to just remain .  br    br   most interesting to me is the dandys  respect for the bjm  despite their lack or reciprocation  and for anton  despite his erratic behavior  . the dandy warhols respect the art the group produces even if the group hates everything the dandy warhols now stand for  although that  s disputable  . the best line is when the drummer for the dandy  s says  i won  t have them anywhere new me again  and the guitarist unconsciously blurts out  i  ll still buy their records though .  to me  this just shows how powerful good music can be .  br    br   definitely see this movie  even if you know nothing of either band . it  s more about the themes of rock music and how they develop that makes this film so interesting . it  s rare to follow a group so closely for so long .  ,1
think of this film as a saturday morning live  action program from ages ago . even the small tykes will find this one hard to please because it runs like molasses  i can  t fully understand how god awful it is to make something too typical and uninteresting  especially in the costume department  too many warrior  wizard movies out there have used the same old plotline numerous times over  but this is mighty scarce considering its appeal to the little darlings . and who in the world would  ve let a topless mermaid be cast in the first place  i thought this was a  family  movie  mst  k  here  s another fine gem for your     tv season   ,0
it started out with an interesting premise . i always like civil war stuff and ancient secret societies . the more the film progressed  the more i realized that this was a b movie at best . in the latter half  it quickly became a c movie  then d  then f  then  i wish that this wasn  t a rental so that i could put it in the microwave   i can  t say that the acting in all cases was awful  just most . the writing  however . . . i never read the book . maybe the book is well written . the screenplay was written by a   year old . it was ridiculously shallow  the dialog drab and uninteresting  the characters about as interesting as a  pound bag of fertilizer . i really hated this movie  as did my wife . i am a christian and i have no problem with movies that promote or support christianity . this movie did a great disservice to the cause . awful  terrible  worthless . if you liked it  i strongly recommend superman  .  ,0
given the opposite circumstance of     where the reality is we do have a black president  this movie takes on quite a powerful historical significance . for entertainment value i found this movie to be both engaging and repugnant . i was quite taken back of course by the blatant racism of the time  but also found the music and dancing incredible . also it is quite cool to see sammy davis jr as such a very young child actor . he plays rufus jones  a young boy who is being consoled by his mammy . he is told  why some day you could be president  . this was so ridiculous in     that it was mocked and thought to be endearing  charming and funny . the bulk of the movie is a fantasy sequence of what the government would be like if it was run by a black man . they depict the seats of government as being like a revivalist baptist church .  br    br   the fact was when i stumbled onto this movie one day it drew me in . it is really well done and very entertaining . i believe if we can look beyond the racism we can see this movie for all it brings us . in fact to realize that it is not only not ridiculous to have a black president  but that it is normal  just makes this movie that much more relevant . it clearly marks a moment in time for our collective consciousness .  ,1
imagine that i was about to miss this great cultural event on swedish tv last night  and it was only because my girlfriend insisted on keeping the tv on  to make it easier for her to fall asleep   that i came across it  yes i had seen an advert for it previously but of course forgotten about it and looked forward to an  early night  . . .  .  br    br   anyway  this must surely be a rather unusual idea  to base a film documentary on an interview made with sound only more than   years ago . but with animated and other documentary film material it adds up to a really good and insightful portrait of one of the   th centuries  most appreciated literary artists  georges remy a . k . a herg .  br    br   i for sure will read my tintin albums with a different eye after having seen this film  which makes it easier to connect the variations in style as well as content with the different periods in herg  s life  and i can tell you that i will a . s . a . p get the few that i don  t have  . of course my perception of the albums has changed over the more than   years that i have already been reading them  as has my view about what albums are my favourites  but this adds  at least  one more dimension to them .  ,1
my take a goofy  yet imaginative mess .  br    br   keanu reeves  yes  that keanu reeves  and alex winter return as the two punk  rock idiots in this sequel to the time  trotting adventure comedy bill and ted  s excellent adventure  now a cult classic . in this sequel  bill and ted are given much more to do than travel through time . they might as well travel heaven and hell too  during the beginning of this sequel  bill and ted are preparing for a  battle of the bands  competition which may make them more famous than ever . meanwhile  many years in a futuristic civilization  the time  wizard from the first film  the always watchable george carlin  is running a university praising bill and ted  s names . there  an evil tyrant  joss ackland  from the hunt for red october  plots to get rid of the two idiot rock  stars once and for all . so he sends two identical android replicas  in the words of bill and ted robot us  s  to do the dirty job .  br    br   there after  bill and ted experience death and must find their way through hell  with inhabitants that happens to include the duo  s worst memories  and then through heaven in an attempt to get back to earth to save their girlfriends . . . and their show . along this whacked  out voyage  they play board games with none other than death  william sadler  from die hard    reminiscent to a similar moment in the     foreign film classic the seventh seal  aid help from a couple of intelligent alien beings and more .  br    br   bogus journey  s array of exuberant special effects gimmicks aren  t up to to  date standards  and even some of the humor and the for  the  time look and feel are somewhat dated  to be honest  the film also feels like it was released on the wrong year  even for the    s  . but with it  s no little lack of imagination and a lively turn by both the performances and direction  bill and ted  s bogus journey is fun  imaginative  and yes  bogus .  br    br   rating     out of  .  ,1
in a series chock  full of brilliant episodes  this one stands out as one of my very favorites . it  s not the most profound episode  there  s no great meaning or message . but it  s a lot of fun  and there are some fine performances .  br    br   but what makes it really stand out for me is that it is  to my knowledge  the only twilight zone episode with a double snapper ending . the zone is rightly famous for providing a big surprise at the end of a story . but this time  you get a surprise  and think that  s that  but it turns out there  s another surprise waiting . i just like that so much  that this is probably one of my two favorite episodes  the other being a deeper  more message  oriented one  .  ,1
i bought this while i was playing chess in hastings . i am from denmark though . it is very good . definitely with an understanding of the horror genre . the monster towards the end is very scary . people who criticise this on imdb should recall that it was a huge succes among serious horror critics .  br    br    ,1
though i saw this movie years ago  its impact has never left me . stephen rea  s depiction of an invetigator is deep and moving . his anguish at not being able to stop the deaths is palpable . everyone in the cast is amazing from sutherland who tries to accommodate him and provide ways for the police to coordinate their efforts  to the troubled citizen x . each day when we are bombarded with stories of mass murderers  i think of this film and the exhausting work the people do who try to find the killers .  ,1
peter m . cohen has a winner satire on the mating game  twisted around and turned inside out . the critical bashing of the movie in mainstream media publications as  offensive  and  raunchy  only serves to underscore its intensity as a refreshing and concentrated dissection of people  s sexual pursuits and passions . it is in the tradition of what i call  reality based  satire following in the footsteps of  in the company of men    chasing amy    your friends and neighbors  and  two girls and a guy  . cohen  s dialogue is hilarious and i was continually intrigued by how perfectly he captured the real pace of today  s conversations . brian van holt  zorie barber  and jonathan abrahams are three distinct  unrelenting sex  obsessed predators who along with the foil of their recently married buddy  superbly played by judah domke  are turned upside down on their own terms by a female predator  amanda peet  . underneath the satiric surface lurks a romantic comedy far more satisfying than most sugar  coated studio products .  ,1
the film begins with a bunch of kids in reform school and focuses on a kid named  gabe   who has apparently worked hard to earn his parole . gabe and his sister move to a new neighborhood to make a fresh start and soon gabe meets up with the dead end kids . the kids in this film are little punks  but they are much less antisocial than they  d been in other previous films and down deep  they are well  meaning punks . however  in this neighborhood there are also some criminals who are perpetrating insurance fraud through arson and see gabe as a convenient scapegoat   after all  he  d been to reform school and no one would believe he was innocent once he was framed . so  when gabe is about ready to be sent back to  the big house   it  s up to the rest of the gang to save him and expose the real crooks .  br    br   the  dead end kids  appeared in several warner brothers films in the late     s and the films were generally very good  particularly angels with dirty faces  . however  after the boys  contracts expired  they went on to monogram studios and the films  to put it charitably  were very weak and formulaic   with huntz hall and leo gorcey being pretty much the whole show and the group being renamed  the bowery boys  . because angels wash their faces had the excellent writing and production values and hall and gorcey were not constantly mugging for the camera  it  s a pretty good film   and almost earns a score of   it  s real close  . in fact  while this isn  t a great film aesthetically  it  s sure a lot of fun to watch  so i will give it a   sure  it was a tad hokey  particularly towards the end when the kids take the law into their own hands and reagan ignores the bill of rights   but it was also quite entertaining . the dead end kids are doing their best performances and ronald reagan and ann sheridan provided excellent support . sure  this part of the film was illogical and impossible but somehow it was still funny and rather charming   so if you can suspend disbelief  it works well .  ,1
holy crap  what a terrible  terrible spanish thriller  i  ve had it for about four years and finally started it the other night . i watched an hour or so before heading to bed . i was pretty intrigued by the whole thing . i finished it last night and couldn  t believe where i stopped it the night before . literally  i stopped it the second before the movie went completely downhill .  br    br   like i said  i was pretty intrigued and curious as to where this mystery was going but stopped it right when simon receives the package in the bar . i picked up when he opens up the package to reveal a laser gun and then plays a  menacing  game of laser tag . whew  then the big reveal is that the whole thing is a terrorist plot by role playing game nerds . whew  you can tell the spanish industry was definitely behind director mateo gil  co  writer of amenabar  s two big previous hits  . there is an excellent score and great photography . but this scenario reeks of silliness . how anyone sat through the last   minutes with a straight face is beyond me .  ,0
this movie contains personalities that so deliciously are playing their parts  i love the final  when nobody knows what are they gonna do about their life  but it  s completely great when you see and realize that the priest is right  is jut for two  so what are the other persons doing there  the movie embrace you to a new life  to experiences  to be able of dream with the other person and reach those dreams . also shows you the life itself  hard like it is . but gives you the option to choose what you want and what you really need . hope this comment works for you . the movie it did worked well for me . i bought the movie by the way   take care .  ,1
  painting is seeing  then remembering better than you saw .  so says dick heldar  ronald colman   the painter in the light that failed . the movie is in the grand old hollywood style  starring ronald colman and a bravura supporting cast that includes ida lupino in her first important role  dependable character actor dudley digges  who also co  starred with colman in condemned .   and a solid performance by the wonderful actor walter huston .  br    br   the title and opening sequences of the film pretty much give away the fact that dick will lose his sight . he  s blinded by gun powder discharge as he and childhood sweetheart maisie  muriel angelus  are playing with a pistol . later a wound while fighting in the sudan is the catalyst for his blindness . he becomes a famous painter  but he  s already blinded by ambition  and doesn  t really reach his full potential until the point that his sight is leaving him . enter bad girl bessie  ida lupino   and his self destruction is set in motion . lupino is very powerful in this role and plays off colman very well . her evil tart reminds me of bette davis in of human bondage .  br    br   well acted and well directed  this is one of my favorite colman melodramas .  ,1
i am stunned to discover the amount of fans this show has . haven  t said that friends was  at best an  average  sitcom  and not as great as others have made out . let  s face it  if it wasn  t for the casting of courtney cox arquette  david schwimmer  matthew perry  lisa kudrow  jennifer aniston and matt le blanc  then who knows whether this show would  ve lasted as long as it has done . i very much doubt that . although as the series progressed  friends got more progressively predictable  lame and boring that i couldn  t care less about the characters  of whom are the most overrated in tv history  or of their plight  nor of who was sleeping with whom . and it went from being funny in the first four seasons to occasionally funny . and even when it had all these a  list hollywood actors from the movie world  i still didn  t bother to tune in . the writing in friends became stale that i lost interest in this show from the sixth season onwards and as for the ending  well it was predictable to say the least .  br    br   what was annoying though was that this lasted for ten seasons  whilst some of my favourite shows lasted for only three  four seasons for instance and were eventually cancelled and taken off the air for good . the show should  ve came to an immediate halt by the time the cast wanted bigger salaries . in truth  as much as the series waned  it was the show that was bigger than the actors themselves  not the other way round .  br    br   when it ended in      i was so relieved to see the back of this sitcom . now  there is talk of a friends reunion show coming to our tv screens very soon . and yet  i for one will not be looking forward to it whatsoever .  ,0
being from canada  i cannot say whether this film is original in the context of danish cinema  unfortunately  we  here  do not get to see many danish films in a year  i also cannot comment on clausen  s acting in the context of his other roles  i personally found him quite believable  a touching monstrosity of a man  this jorgen  as for the actor who played kenneth  why would his participation in a tv show rule him out as an actor  aren  t we over such elitist attitudes  international viewers unaware of his big brother participation will find him a fair actor .  br    br   in spite of the movie  s faults  the writing could have been subtler in some instances   i do subscribe to what one could call the  message  of the film  namely art  s essential role in everyday life  art as healing force . art  as nietzsche said  sanctifies the lie   kunst heiligt die luege    it is a holy lie the wedding scene is fabulous in this sense  a theatrical  not religious  wedding  celebrating love and life as play . . .  ,1
this is the worst movie i have ever seen  and i have seen quite a few movies . it is passed off as an art film  but it is really a piece of trash . it  s one redeeming quality is the beautiful tango dancing  but that cannot make up for sally potter  s disgustingly obvious tribute to herself . the plot of this movie is nonexistent  and i guarantee you will start laughing by the end . especially where she starts singing . it  s absolutely unreal .  ,0
you  re using the imdb .  br    br   you  ve given some hefty votes to some of your favourite films .  br    br   it  s something you enjoy doing .  br    br   and it  s all because of this . fifty seconds . one world ends  another begins .  br    br   how can it not be given a ten  i wonder at those who give this a seven or an eight . . . exactly how could the first film ever made be better  for the record  the long  still opening shot is great showmanship  a superb innovation  perfectly suited to the situation . and the dog on the bike is a lovely touch . all this within fifty seconds .  br    br   the word genius is often overused .  br    br   this is genius .  ,1
this film was so amateurish i could hardly believe what i was seeing . it is shot on video  not film  i have not seen the likes of this since the early    s  when late night networks showed movie of the week  horror flicks  shot in . . . . . . video . it looks like a bad soap opera  and that is paying it a compliment . some of the actors give it their best shot . michael des barres does okay with what he is given to do  which is to act like a sex addict out of control . i can  t say that it is pleasant to watch .  br    br   nastassja kinski as the therapist sits in a chair for practically the entire film  with very little variation in camera angles . i can  t fault her for someone else  s poor blocking  but she is totally unbelievable in her role . her little girl voice works against her here . and i consider myself a nastassja kinski fan . she is certainly ageless and exotic  but she  s outside her range with this .  br    br   alexandra paul is pathetically overwrought . every line she delivers is with three exclamation points . someone must have directed her to scream at all costs . why would michael des barres want to have sex with such a raging shrew   br    br   finally  rosanna arquette as the sweet  maligned wife comes off okay  and probably the most believable of the bunch . but that is not saying much .  br    br   this has to be the worst film i have seen in years .  ,0
fairly funny jim carrey vehicle that has him as a news reporter who temporarily gets the power of god and wrecks havoc . carrey is back in familiar ground here and looks to be having a good time  and jennifer aniston as his put upon girlfriend is also charming and affecting . the story is predictible to the extreme but the cast  including morgan freeman as  god   is great and makes the film worth catching . grade b  ,1
richard attenborough who already given us magnific films as  a chorus line  and  gandhi   once more surprise us making a beautiful hymn to the nature . indeed  the vast and  in that time  unexplored territory of canada helps to compose the stunning beauty of the landscapes picked up by the motion picture camera . if the movie is really based on a true story  once more becomes evidente that  men of vision  are  in truth  men that lives beyond their time  with a historical perspective that only the time will give them reason . the cinematography is magnificient  such as the cast lead by pierce brosnan  whose performance is due to attenborough  s master hands . a pleasing surprise is the appearance of annie galipeau in the role of archie  s beloved . movie that must appears in a list of those who really loves the nature . . .  ,1
i found the characters mediocre and the story uninteresting . i never had to read this book  thankfully   or it would have been a painful experience . i got the tickets to the preview for free but it still wasn  t worth my time  or my friend  s . i think this story is not worth telling . it  s like saying that old people have a past before they got old  no kidding  . the lives of the main characters were painful to watch  one generation no better than the next at avoiding stupid mistakes . however  i think the actors did the best they could with a lame story . i  ve always been a big fan of ellen burstyn . i  m writing this review to counteract the positive reviews given  which unfortunately convinced me to give this movie a try .  ,0
please don  t waste your time . this movie rehashes the worst of bram stoker  s dracula  van helsing   anne rice  s vampire lestat  rock music and silly biblical references   and blade  high  tech toys  . i really like vampire movies and novels  and there are many out there that are very good . but not this stinker . not even the soundtrack helps it  mostly because the movie resorts to ridiculous scary classical music rather than the  kick  ass metal  some reported . only a few times did i hear any metal mostly it was tortured violins . avoid it like garlic and crucifixes .  ,0
the horror channel plays nothing but erotic soft porn gothic flicks each night from   pm till about  in the morning  but their  scare  factor is very limited  if one exists at all . in fact i am sure i will find a multi  million pound lottery win more scary than anything this channel has to offer .  br    br   the bloodsucker leads the dance deserves special mention because it is i feel  the undisputed low of a channel full of lows . i cannot even begin to tell you how bad this film is  but for the purpose of completing the minimum   lines demanded by this site  i will at least give it a go .  br    br   firstly the title is misleading and bears no resemblance to the action on the screen . in fact the film might as well have been called  toothbrush  or  wallpaper  for all it has to do with the plot . at least they used toothbrushes . . . at least they had wallpaper .  br    br   there are no bloodsuckers for miles around and whats even worse there are no dances  not one . i  m sure they were making two different films by mistake here .  br    br   a more suitable title would have been   horny italian count leads five people to a scary castle and bores us silly for ninety minutes .  yes that fits better .  br    br   the acting is terrible and and the dubbing appalling  and that guy who plays seymour was almost as wooden in his walk as he was in his character . . . . abysmal .  br    br   the only saving graces of this film are a small but slightly interesting lesbian sex scene  two small and very interesting heterosexual sex scenes  and the added attraction in that every single female character gets her kit off . bonus .  br    br   otherwise steer a wide birth away from this one . no vampires  no dancing  no scenes of a brutal or gruesome nature and no way on gods earth i will ever  ever  ever watch this one again .  br    br   no word of a lie  this film could put you off motion pictures for life .  ,0
i saw this when it first came to video  my little sister got it as a gift and i was probably   at the time . . . what stood out for me was the lack of mid  movie conflict that so many movies have  where the main characters get mad at each other because when it comes time to explain themselves they just don  t say the one thing that you  re shouting at the screen that would make sense of the whole deal  that any person of reasonable intellect would know to say . this is what i like the most about the movie i guess  that the main characters don  t do mean things to each other halfway through . . . they don  t break up and make up  they just grow to like each other more as the movie goes on .  br    br   these two kids team up and though they seem at first to be from opposite sides of the track  they  re not that different . loui is actually just some middle class kid that needed to realize how lucky he was to have a loving family  and cecelia was an upper class kid that just needed to prove to her family that she existed and they would miss her if she was gone . anyway  i saw this movie posted on hulu and had to watch it again . . . sure there  s plot holes if you analyze the script and no  woog and dweeb shouldn  t be eating hot dogs since they would have been herbivores in reality .  br    br   now  what detracts from the film is it  s unexpected scariness . little kids under the age of  would probably be frightened by the scenes with dr . screweyes . and  the addition of him halfway through the movie  though it  s blatantly obvious in the first scene that he will make an appearance  is too abrupt . . . there should be a glimpse of him doing his show earlier in the movie  perhaps to show that it  s not that scary without the the dinosaurs . i guess it just lacked any real present danger for the entire first half of the movie  so that it lacks a little continuity when he appears for the second half .  br    br   considering the target audience  who i  m sure can overlook the not so mind blowing animation and dialog issues . . . i think i  ll give it a pass on those factors too  and just enjoy the story . it  s a great flick for kid and it does stick in your mind . . . makes you kinda think about how you treat people and it should be revisited every   years i think .  ,1
i thoroughly enjoyed this flick . i am of the firm belief that matt stone and trey parker are comic geniuses of our time . they have the uncanny ability to add this level of absurdity to pop culture and make it rediculous but in a realistic way . . . if that makes any sense . this is mainly what makes south park soooo funny . once you get past the fact that it is probably the most vulgar and indiscreet cartoon ever  you see in every episode the message that is being conveyed . that is apparent in baseketball . although it is directed by david zucker and is utterly rediculous  it has a sincere message about corporate america and the disgrace that is major league sports . i am also a fan of sports so i find this movie hilarious at times because it is so true in that bizarre way that people hate to love . the opening prologue is brilliant . . . tears from laughter form everytime i see those football players begin riverdance  some may not like this movie because it  s just not everyone  s cup of tea . . . but  just like south park  once you look past the absurdity . . . it has a really genuine message that is conveyed through literal comic genius . i gave this movie  out of   stars .  ,1
alfred hitchcock invented any kind of thriller you could think ofhe set the standards so high that any director who makes a suspense movie will be fatally compared to him .  br    br   the main subject of this bullock vehicle  all the ideas  almost everything was already in hitchcock  s classic  rope  the two students who commit a gratuitous crime  nietsche  s philosophy  and the clues that the boys disseminate  the master was the first to transfer them to the screen . and with an eighty  minute movie which was a technical riveting tour de force .  br    br    murder by numbers  does not take place in a single room  like  the rope   mind you . and  what a supreme originality  it pits two cops against the evil youngstersand  you would never guess it  these two cops are very differentactually  bullock plays the part of woman living like a man  and her partner  chaplin  is as shy as a clueless girlie . the two boys  performances are not really mind  boggling  not as good  as  say  that of edward norton in  primal fear  .  br    br   well  you know   rope  was so good . . . .  ,0
nobody  but nobody  could chew the scenery like the divine one  ruth elizabeth davis  and  elizabeth and essex  is a great example why . although she overplays the part at times  watch her when she gawfs about raliegh writing the lyrics to a song her ladies  in  waiting are about to play in that one moment  she makes us understand how elizabeth was able to rule and rule absolutely  at other times  she is done in by the script  s sappiness . when elizabeth has to be vulnerable  she comes off as weak and shrewish . this has the added effect of undermining her authority when she blows her stack and threatens to dispense justice  it  s hard to take her seriously .  br    br   flynn exudes charm  making us see how essex was able to worm his way into elizabeth  s heart  but he is totally inept at conveying the complexity and sheer evil of the man . it also doesn  t help that essex is badly underwritten . why is he this hothead who wants to overthrow his queen  even as he swears fidelity to her  except only that he is more blue  blooded  thus  more  worthy  of rule  and why does raliegh betray elizabeth by intercepting her and essex  s letters  he  s in no risk of falling out of favor  and we know where essex  and his head  is headed . so why does he risk his own head by speeding up the inevitable   br    br   what did curtiz do with all the  he was given  he doesn  t even bother to try to hide the fact that his battle scenes are shot on a sound stage . he should  ve ended it with elizabeth the first time alone at the tower everything else that follows  especially the final scene between her and essex  is unnecessary . the costumes are fantastic . and is it me  or does bette look exactly like susan sarandon   ,0
i rented this movie because i was browsing through the horror movie section for those movies that no one  s heard of and could be a possible gem . i saw this and  since i  m a fan of violence and gore  i got it . it got the rating of em which means extremely mature . thinking that this rare and high rating was totally meant for violence and everything else  i got it . the warning on the box said extreme violence  extreme langauge  and nudity . the  extreme violence  struck my fancy . the movie ended being a pretty tame slasher flick . it had one or two gory scenes but i  ve seen worse in a pg    movie . of course the amount of gore in a movie isn  t all that counts  right  you have plot also . well  the plot was boring and there nothing really special about it . don  t rent it . i speak the truth . i can  t imagine how someone could really enjoy it to the point where they say  i  m gonna rent that again .  it had it  s moments where it kept you going but i  m never going to see that film again .  ,0
shower keeps within itself in so many ways . almost all of the movie takes place in an old  time bathhouse  with the denizens supplying the humor  pathos  and emotional touches . the love and friendship between the proprietor and his retarded son is deep and moving . the way the older brother is drawn into this tiny world seems unforced and persuasive . the plot is meandering  full of surprises and ironies  and touched overall by a sense of what i  d have to call neighborliness in the relations and conflicts of the performers . this is a film i pull out when i want to believe in the world again .  ,1
but it does have some good action and a plot that is somewhat interesting . nevsky acts like a body builder and he isn  t all that attractive  in fact  imo  he is ugly .  his acting skills lack everything   sascha is played very well by joanna pacula  but she needed more lines than she was given  her character needed to be developed . there are way too many men in this story  there is zero romance  too much action  and way too dumb of an ending . it is very violent . i did however love the scenery  this movie takes you all over the world  and that is a bonus . i also liked how it had some stuff about the mafia in it  not too much or too little  but enough that it got my attention . the actors needed to be more handsome . . . the biggest problem i had was that nevsky was just too normal  not sexy enough . i think for most guys  sascha will be hot enough  but for us ladies that are fans of action  nevsky just doesn  t cut it . overall  this movie was fine  i didn  t love it nor did i hate it  just found it to be another normal action flick .  ,0
this is a japanese film but there is quite a bit of english also spoken in here . it  s a pretty film  with nice visuals  featuring the scenic beauty of hawaii .  br    br   however  that was the only redeeming quality for me . the story was generally boring . who wants to watch a young woman sulk for   percent of the film because her  picture  husband is a lot older than he advertised he was  granted  that could be a bummer . . . . . . but get over it   br    br   only in the last   minutes does she do an about  face and become fond of him . by then  for most viewers  it was too little  too late . we  d fallen asleep by then .  ,0
i suppose many people comment  review their first movie on imdb because the movie was spectacular or horrible   i  m writing due to the latter .  br    br   i was excited for the sequel to  wargames  . . i thought the original was quite good considering its time period and content  i felt it was worth watching more than once . this being      i had high hopes for what they would do with this film . computers  gaming  terror  military over  zealousness have all grown so much since the time of the first film  and  wargames the dead code  had an opportunity to bring it all into a great flick .  br    br   the movie failed on pretty much every level  but i particularly blame the writers and anyone who had any input regarding the realism of gaming aspects .  the dead code  was a      s air flight simulator with a few people on the ground waving their arms . meanwhile  will farmer is button mashing about      commands   none of which are impacting what is happening on the screen . until finally he  wins  by clicking a box on the screen with his mouse that release gas that instantly kills       virtual people  nobody is near the gas  . because he beat  levels in   minutes  this tells ripley  the real life war machine  that he is a high level terror threat .  br    br   even though any     year old could complete this same task  the government believes he is a lethal threat to humanity . they say things like  he has expert knowledge of bio  terror  . . . he displayed less knowledge than someone who read the first  paragraphs of the wiki entry on bio  terror . so then a movie  long chase scene with about .    of the budget and excitement of any of the bourne titles ensues . they have about     opportunities to catch him and clear up the entire matter . . sometimes they are mad they barely miss him . . but other times they masterfully create opportunities just let him go intentionally to follow him .  br    br   ugh . . . i would write more . . but i already wasted  .  hours watching this  i would rather watch the broderick and joshua play tic  tac  toe for  .  hours .  ,0
the next  to  last episode aired of the original star trek series is an interesting  sometimes melancholy installment that proves the show was still exploring its characters even at this point in the third season though flawed   all our yesterdays  has its moments and overall a moody  compelling feel to it . kirk  spock  and mccoy beam down to a planet  assuming they are arriving in the nick of time to save or at least give some warning to whatever populace is there  since the planet  s sun is due to explode within hours . but as it turns out  the people there are all too aware of the planet  s fate  and using a kind of time travel device  have escaped into the past . each person has been able to choose the time and place in the past where he or she would like to live at a  library   run by an elderly man named mr . atoz . atoz assumes the three men are looking for a past to live in as well  and shows them various periods from which they can choose on viewers . there is some rather forced confusion at the start of the episode  with lines like  br    br   mccoy  where did they go  atoz  wherever they wanted to .  br    br   the misunderstanding could be cleared up rather easily  but for plot purposes  it isn  t  and soon kirk finds himself transported back to a period resembling   th century england  while spock and mccoy are sent to an ice age      years in the planet  s past . from here  the main focus is on spock and his relationship with a woman exiled to this time by a tyrant as punishment . spock begins acting increasingly emotional  showing anger toward mccoy and deep affection for zarabeth  the woman . he eventually realizes that he is reverting back to the primitive emotional state of his ancestors on vulcan      years ago . kirk makes his way back to the library first  and finally convinces mr . atoz they don  t belong in his planet  s history . spock and mccoy return just before it  s too late  leaving zarabeth behind the enterprise beams the three up and speeds away as the sun explodes  destroying the planet . the interaction between spock and zarabeth provides this episode  s most memorable moments  though kirk  s adventure into the  english  past is amusing . all in all  a very decent latter  day star trek outing .  ,1
its about time that gunga din is released on dvd . i cannot accurately say how many times i have watched this fine film but  i never tire of it . the lead actors worked so well together . victor mclaglen  sgt mcchesney   cary grant  sgt cutter  and douglas fairbanks jr  sgt ballentine  are an unbeatable team .  br    br   i just cannot get over their exploits in india . your first glimpse at the sergeants three  is when you see them engaged in fighting with other soldiers over a so  called treasure map . the three sergeants are sent on an expedition to find out what happened to the communications line an they enter a mostly deserted town  or so they think .  br    br   they engage in the necessary repairs and soon find a few  residents  in hiding . soon after they get attacked by a group of madmen and barely make an escape back to base .  br    br   later they are sent on another mission which gives sgt cutter a chance to go hunting for the gold with din . they find the temple of gold and are trapped by the evil kali supporters . din is sent to fetch help and cutter gets captured . soon mcchesney and ballentine arrive with din  and they are too captured .  br    br   faced with being killed  they watch helplessly as their regiment comes to rescue them . the evil doers watch and are about to spring their surprise attack when a wounded din climbs onto the golden dome and blows his bugle which then alerts the british to the ambush . in doing this  din is shot dead .  br    br   the soldiers attack the evil ones and soon defeat them . at the end  din is honored as he is made an honorary corporal in the british army .  ,1
  mojo  is a story of fifties london  a world of budding rock stars  violence and forced homosexuality .  mojo  uses a technique for shooting the     s often seen in films that stresses the physical differences to our own time but also represents dialogue in a highly exaggerated fashion  owing much to the way that speech was represented in films made in that period   i have no idea if people actually spoke like this outside of the movies  but no films made today and set in contemporary times use such stylised language . it  s as if the stilted discourse of     s screenwriters serves a common shorthand for a past that seems  in consequence  a very distant country indeed and therefore stresses the particular  rather than the universal  in the story .  mojo  features a strong performance from ian hart and annoying ones from aiden gillan and ewan bremner  the latter still struggling to build a post   trainspotting  career but feels like a period piece  a modern film incomprehensibly structured in an outdated idiom . rather dull  actually .  ,0
first  what i didn  t like . the acting was not really up to the hamlet standard . branagh was really over  the  top  doing a lot of yelling mostly . in my opinion  those actors who were not big  name celebrities generally did a better job though i would except billy crystal and robin williams .  and charlton heston  too  but i wasn  t sure if he was playing at being a hack .  a lot of the ambiguities in the play were clearly resolved one way in the flashbacks .  br    br   what i think speaks very much in this play  s favor is that it is accessible . shakespeare is hard to understand for the vast majority of people nowadays many people are not even inclined to try  because of its reputation as serious literature and its archaic english . if they see this film they will understand clearly at least one man  s interpretation of the play . they will be seeing it more as shakespeare  s audiences saw it a play with sword fights and battles  and mighty kings and nobles  murder and incest and evil schemes and ghosts   and great art  if one cares to look for it  but in shakespeare  s day most didn  t  any more than most people do now . branagh  s overacting  and his forcing of his interpretation of the story on the viewer  may detract from shakespeare  s art somewhat  but it is better that modern audiences get a piece of it  rather than nothing .  br    br   i  ve got to say one more thing though . some people are complaining that  it  s set in the   th century and that wasn  t shakespeare  s time  . well  in shakespeare  s time their costume and scenery was that of their own day for all of their plays . shakespeare may have said it  s in the days of ancient rome or medieval denmark or whatever  but he didn  t dress his characters up like they were  he used the costumes of his own time . for the same reason his plays are full of anachronisms . for example  in king john the english and french have cannons   in robin hood  s day . in julius caesar they talk of chimneys  which wouldn  t be invented for another thousand years  and in henry iv they talk about machiavelli  who wasn  t even born yet then . so i think this objection is silly   you might as well complain that the play isn  t in danish  after all they live in denmark don  t they   .  ,1
honestly  this is the best reality show anyone has ever come up with . in order to win the money you have to actually be intelligent . not only that you  ve got to be brave  athletic  cunning  etc . it actually requires skill . not like some lame  ass shows that are on these days . and yet  they only have two seasons of it  bull . . they need to bring this show back    br    br   although  they  ll have a hard time pulling anderson cooper away from cnn . he was great .  br    br   but seriously  it was an amazing show . you never knew who would be going when . and it was so much fun trying to figure out the mole yourself  it was a show you could actually play yourself if you wanted to   br    br   bring back the mole     bring back the mole      ,1
oh just what i needed  another movie about   th century england . which is pretty much like regular england  only nobody  s vandalising football stadiums . in this picturesque setting of lords  dames and other randomly chosen titles  charlotte gainsbourg walks around aimlessly as jane eyre  from that novel nobody has ever read willingly . jane usually hangs out in mr . rochester  s crib  where she tries to teach a french girl to look at an empty chalkboard all the time . one day  mr . rochester  william hurt on auto  pilot  comes back to fall in love with jane and all that  but there  s still the matter of his fruitcake wife that is locked in the attic . oops  that wasn  t in the brochure . after some people being thrown around and some carefully spread fire  they probably rented the set   the movie finally comes to an end . everything looked really authentic  that  s something i guess . but then again  nah .  ,0
this movie looked as if it might be good at the beginning  but never fleshed out to it  s expectations . the director is talented and has some good camera angles and artistic ideas  typical of the asian directors   but doesn  t know how to create or tell a good story to go along with it . the story was fragmented and seemed to go off in all sorts of different directions throughout the film  never finding a solid  explainable  interesting angle . basically  the movie never fit the explanation on the press releases . the acting was very good  however . all the actors gave good performances  and jude law was outstanding as he is always is . it is too bad he chose to do such a weak film .  ,0
stupid and just plain weird movie about some kid who becomes traumatized when he finds out santa isn  t real      . he grows up and becomes an adult  brandon maggart  who makes lists of people who are naughty or nice . one christmas he snaps and sets out to kill the naughty people   dressed as santa of course .  br    br   boring and just plain bad killer santa movie . if you  re looking for gore  it  s not here . only a few of the murders are shown and they  re not that gory with very fake effects . most of the movie just contains brandon maggart talking to himself and slowly going crazy . the script is trite  the acting is terrible and it leads to an ending which had me staring slack  jawed at the tv . seriously  i had to rewind the tape and watch it again to make sure i wasn  t hallucinating  really really poor ending .  br    br   if you want a scary christmas flick rent  black christmas   the original   s version    not the terrible remake  . avoid this one at all costs .  ,0
  malfique  is an example of how a horror film can be effective with nothing more than a well  executed plot and a lot of heart . its cast doesn  t have recognized names  it doesn  t have a big budget and it certainly lacks in the visual effects aspect but it compensates all that with an intelligent and well  written script  an effective cast and the vision of a director focused more on telling the story than in delivering cheap thrills . eric valette may not be a well  know name yet  but with  malfique   his feature length debut  he proves he is at the level of contemporaries like jeunet  gans or aja .  br    br   the film is the story of four prisoners in a cell  four different men with very different backgrounds but with one single goal to get out . carrre  grald laroche  gets imprisoned after being declared guilty of a multi  millionaire fraud his cell  mates  the violent marcus  clovis cornillac   the intellectual lassalle  philippe laudenbach  and the mentally challenged pquerette  dimitri rataud   are all convicted for murder and give carrre a cold welcome . their personalities will clash as carrre discovers an ancient book detailing how a former prisoner escaped using black magic .  br    br   written by alexandre charlo and franck magnier   malfique  is a great mix of dark fantasy and horror in a way very reminiscent of clive barker  s stories . the movie  s strongest point is the way it builds up the characters  they are all have very complex and different personalities and a lot of the tension and suspense comes from their constant clash of personalities . the story  s supernatural element is very well  handled and overall gives the film the feeling of reading a gothic novel . despite being a movie about four men locked in a room  the movie never gets boring or tiresome and in fact  the isolation of the group increases the feeling of distrust  claustrophobia  and specially  paranoia .  br    br   director eric valette makes a great use of atmosphere  mood and his cast to give life to the plot . despite its obvious lack of budget  he has crafted a brilliant film that feels original  fresh and very attractive . his subtle and effective camera  work helps to make the film dynamic despite its single location  and the slow pace the film unfolds is excellent to create the heavy atmosphere of isolation and distrust the movie bases its plot . the very few displays of special effects are very well  done and valette trades quantity for quality in the few but terrific scenes of gore .  br    br   the characters are what make this film work  and the cast definitely deserves some of the credit . grald laroche is excellent as carrre  a man at first sight innocent  but who hides a dark past . philippe laudenbach and dimitri rataud are very effective too  specially rataud in his very demanding role . however  is clovis cornillac who steal the show with his performance as marcus  a violent and disturbed man who deep inside only wants to be himself . the characters are superbly developed and the cast makes the most of them .  br    br   the movie is terrific  but it is not without its share of flaws . of course  the most notorious one is its the low  budget . some of the cgi  effects are a bit poor compared to the effective make  up and prosthetics used in other scenes  however  it is never too bad for it . probably the bad thing about  malfique  is that it seems to lose some steam by the end when it focuses on the supernatural black magic rather than in the characters  not too much of a bad thing but the ending may seem weak from that point of view .  br    br   anyways   malfique  is another one of those great horror films coming out from france lately  and one that deserves to have more recognition . valette is definitely a talent to follow as this modest  albeit complex  tale of the supernatural is prove enough of his abilities . personally  this film is a new favorite .      ,1
if you have ever seen a movie by brian avenet  bradley and compares it to the feedbacks it gets on imdb  you know that most of the comments and votes are faked . trust me you will be bored  people of the production team write their feedback themselves  sometimes they even admit it  . but that  s not enough they also click constantly  no  whenever there is a negative comment on the movie . that  s why negative critics are always placed behind the hyped ones .  br    br   the movie itself is bad  bad  bad bad acting  bad lighting  bad script  bad ending . believe me now  if not  you will believe me later   br    br   brian avenet  bradley might be quite a good business man . otherwise it cannot be explained that he finds people who still finance his movies .  okay  they are cheap  but nevertheless .  but as a creative person  he is a complete failure .  ,0
in a near future  the ordinary man above any suspicious from the suburb morgan sullivan  jeremy northam  is hired by digicorp  a huge corporation  to be assigned as a spy and steal secrets from their competitors  sunways . along his training  morgan is brainwashed  assumes a new identity of jack thursby and travels to boring lectures . in one of them  he is approached by the beautiful and mysterious rita foster  lucy liu   who advises him that nothing is how it seems to be . morgan acknowledges a new reality  where he does not know who can be trusted .  br    br   the unknown  cypher  was a great surprise for me . this movie has not been released in brazil  but the engaging and exciting story is quite complex  with many plot points  and with great screenplay  direction and performances . in the very last twist  i recalled arnold schwarzenegger  s  total recall  . this movie certainly deserves to be watched more than once  and i really did not like the last scene  when the independent spy disposes the disputed disc in the sea . in only know the director vicenzo natali from the fantastic  cube   and this second work i see is also stunning . my vote is eight .  br    br   title  brazil   not available  ,1
presenting lily mars  mgm       is a cute film  but in my opinion it could have been better . judy garland is great as always  but some scenes in the film seem out of place and the romance between her and van heflin develops all too quickly .  br    br   i mean  one minute he  s ready to beat her butt  but the next minute he falls in love with her . i believe that this production  the film editing  and the script  even though the photography was great  the scenery was nice and the costumes were nice as well  could have been a little better . it feels as though the production was too rushed .  br    br   the supporting cast was good as well  especially little janet chapman as the second youngest daughter daughter rosie . she at the age of    looks really cute and it  s a shame that she didn  t develop into a teenage comic actress . she  s much better in this film than in her previous films as warner brothers in the late      s  except for broadway musketeers      she  s really good in that   when they tried to make her into a shirley temple  sybil jason hybrid . overall  this film could better  but in the end  judy gave it her all .  ,1
okay so i found out about this movie and i watched the preview read almost all the reviews and was having a hard time debating whether i should watch it or not . before i even watched the movie i was emotionally weird on it . i was so unsure if i was going to watch this and be disturbed for like a long time . so i choose to risk it and watched it and heres what i thought the beginning started off fine for me . it seemed to be heading in a decent direction . got past the rape scene and i couldn  t figure why people were so disturbed or bored by the movie . don  t get me wrong the rape scene was just as sad and scary but it didn  t really bother me to a dramatic point . then as the middle came in i understood the boring stuff that was going on . there was like  minutes shots of nothing but people walking around saying or showing nothing  its one thing to have a shot where a person is showing some kind of emotion but this movie didn  t have that . it had about  of these pointless scenes  where you see the main character maya kind of get out of control but it didn  t show it right making me want to fast forward . then when she engaged in the hardcore partying it wasn  t so boring but still a little dull . oh and as a note rosario dawson still did a great job . okay moving on so finally after an hour of pointlessness to the middle the revenge comes to maya  s attention . thats where it got disturbing . i didn  t feel bad for him or nothing he got what he deserved but the whole scene was really disturbing and i just felt all eck after it . i cant really tell you whether or not to watch this movie because its so . . . i don  t know i cant find a word to sum it up . but if you choose to watch it just don  t be unsuprised .  ,0
along with the  maratonci trce pocasni krug  from the same director  one of the masterpieces of ex  yugoslavia comedies . if you want to understand serbian mentality  you must see this movie . and if you want to see several of ex  yugoslav great actors at the same time  this is a opportunity .  ,1
i couldn  t watch more than   minutes of it . it  s a great combination of really bad acting and really bad directing . the shots used are disgusting  they broke the    degrees angle all the time . my head hurts try to watch that load of  you know what  . dirt on the  mystery machine  window make you see light from the lighting on the windows . . . annoying . what else . . . it  s so badly framed all the time it  s just make you want to scream at that lady directing there . i only directed short films  but i  m pretty sure i  d be way better than that directing a feature film . . . . the story is unbelievable  just the long french kissing scene at the beginning tell you that it  s gonna be pretty awful . so pretty much  try to avoid this really bad movies at all cost  it  ll save you the  bucks or so for the rental  and that  h   hour of your life you  ll never get back . . .  ,0
first off  consider that this film is nearly fifty years old  yet  it still stands up as one of the great films of all time . i wonder how many of todays throwaway celluloid productions will still be talked about in       br    br   the story is simple  yet solid enough and the effects are nothing short of phenomenal for the day . i can still recall the first time i watched this  as a kid  when the monster enters the force  field protecting the ship and you got to see its outline for the first  and only  time . had me shivering in fear  i can tell you . looks dated today  but still more than effective enough .  br    br   the scenes with the tiger show their age now . you can see the outline where the tiger was matted into the shots with altaira  but they are only just visible .  br    br   likewise  the effect whereby the creature melts its way through the krell doors are wonderfully done .  br    br   it  s also amazing to see leslie nielsen  better remembered for the airplane and naked gun movies  as a young  but still mature man . he was   when this film came out  nearly   now   br    br   all in all a good movie that is sure to continue being a favourite for years to come . timeless .  ,1
i loved october sky . the thing i loved most had to be the music . it worked two ways in the first hour of the film  it gives the viewer a time  frame . this is done by playing songs from the late fifties . in the second hour  an instrumental score takes over . the music now fits the mood of the film perfectly .  br    br   i did not only enjoy the music  i also quite enjoyed the cast . jake gyllenhaal as homer hickam was especially a surprise for me . he gave off a first  class performance  as did chris owen  quentin  and chris cooper  john hickam  .  br    br   i  ve seen this movie about escaping the life already laid out for you twice now  and both times i thoroughly enjoyed myself .  ,1
  yokai daisenso  is a children  s film by takashi miike  but as you might expect  it  s probably a bit too dark  scary for younger ones . however  older children may well eat this up  that is  if you play it dubbed in english .  br    br   the story is that of a young boy  who has moved with his mother to the country  to live with his grandfather  after a divorce . during a village festival the boy is chosen as a  kirin rider   a great honor  but with that honor comes much danger and adventure  of course .  br    br   meanwhile  evil doings are at hand as a woman in a white mini skirt  go  go boots  a beehive hair  do  teams up with an evil yokai to turn people  s resentments and discarded items against them . and this evil has manifested itself as a flying city in the form of a monster that heads for the city of rage itself  tokyo . one quite funny scene has two derelicts watching the monster fly over the city . . . says one   oh  it  s only gamera  .  br    br   the young boy has befriended yokai  which are monsters of a kind  mostly benign  that have isolated themselves away from humans  and all the yokai in japan band together to fight the evil .  br    br   in many ways miike  crew have taken the late    s  early    s yokai films and turned them into a modern action adventure film for  older  kids that also combines some strange mechanical monsters that made me think of  transformers  . the look and feel of the film is great  the effects are entertaining  and some of the humor will just sail right over kid  s heads  but still  older ones might enjoy it . as for adults  there  s not much here not to like  if you  re a fan of japanese monster movies you  ll enjoy the heck out of this .  br    br   cool  fun stuff  kind of dark at times but perhaps that  s just miike . . and what a wild ride .  out of   .  ,1
i saw this movie first on the berlin film festival  and i had never seen hong kong cinema before . i felt like sitting in a roller coaster the action was so quick  and there wasn  t one boring moment throughout the film . it has martial arts  love  special effects and a fantastic plot . my favorite scene is when the taoist drinks  sings and fights for himself  one of the many scenes which stress the extraordinary musical component of the movie . this film is a definite must    ,1
  the thing about my folks  came in as a surprise . we had no idea about what to expect . the film directed by raymond defelitta  and based on a screen play by one of its stars  paul reiser  proved to be a pleasant time at the movies . although the film is predictable and we know what will be the outcome  this is a voyage of discovery where ben gets to know his father  perhaps for the first time in his life  ben sees his father for what he really is  and not the mythical figure he has in his mind .  br    br   the film seems to be a vehicle for its star  peter falk  and he runs away with the movie  as it was expected . mr . falk  one of the most endearing actors working in movies in this era and in past years  is an actor of such stature  he must be reckoned with . as sam kleinman  the distant father to ben  he is a man that clearly is misunderstood  not only by ben  but it appears by the whole family and his wife of forty  seven years .  br    br   when muriel  the matriarch of the kleinman clan  runs away  everyone goes into a panic because this woman  who has been the strong figure of the family  is vital to keep everyone together . not knowing where she has gone  sam shows up at ben  s house confused as he feels abandoned  suddenly  by the woman he married and has been faithful for all those years .  br    br   ben  the youngest son  takes his father on a trip to look for a house he wants to buy so he can get his own family out of manhattan into the country . the trip provides the excuse for ben to bond with his father in ways he never knew about because the old man had always projected an aloof figure to his younger son . along the way  father and son realize how much they love one another and how misunderstood the old man has been by his children . the love of sam for muriel spans the many years they have known one another they seem inseparable .  br    br   peter falk is magnificent in the film . he makes an excellent sam kleinman  the man who suddenly realizes his life is about to change for the worst . mr . falk shines as the older man and there  s never a false movement in his interpretation of the man whose whole world is crumbling under him .  br    br   not being a paul reiser fan  we must confess that as ben kleinman  he is right . ben and his father discover how much in common they both have and their love for muriel  the mother that has sacrificed her life in order to keep the family together . olympia dukakis is only seen at the end of the film . she makes a good contribution as the fleeing mother . elizabeth perkins plays rachel with great style . .  br    br   the film has a beautiful look thanks to the cinematography of dan gillham  and the excellent musical score by steven argila . ultimately  the film shows a great team effort between its director  mr . defelitta and paul reiser who wrote it for the screen .  br    br   although this film is clearly targeted for an older audience  it should please anyone .  ,1
disney goes to the well one too many times as anybody who has seen the original little mermaid will feel blatantly ripped off . celebrating the birth of their daughter melody  ariel and eric plan on introducing her to king triton . the celebration is quickly crashed by ursula  s sister  morgana who plans to use melody as a defense tool to get the king  s trident . stopping the attack  ariel and eric build a wall around the ocean while melody grows up wondering why she cannot go in there .  br    br   awful and terrible is what describes this direct to video sequel . little mermaid  gives you that feeling everything you watch seemed to have come straight other disney movies . i guess disney can only plagiarize itself  do not tell me that the penguin and walrus does not remind you of another duo from the lion king   br    br   other disappointing moments include the rematch between sebastien and louie  the royal chef . they terribly under played it  the climax between morgana and everyone seemed to be another disappointment .  br    br   i will not give anything away  but in   minutes  everything seemed incredibly cramped and too much to handle . an embarrassment to disney  little mermaid  is better left to rent and laugh at . then you can prepare for the rest of the other sequels disney is going to drown you in later on .  ,0

justifications for what happened to his movie in terms of distributors and secondary directors  drunks and receptionists doing script rewrites aside  let  s just take this movie as it  s offered  without extraneous explanations .  br    br   this movie is god awful . straight up craptastic . rather than rehash what may serve as a plot  i  ll run a highlight reel of some curious points that made me scratch my head .  br    br   a class  of   take a field trip for a history class to the middle of friggin  nowhere ireland . these students may be canadian or american  it  s difficult to tell . that it was filmed in a canadian forest rather than ireland is rather obvious as well . one student seems to know nothing about history and is basically the  dumb jock  character from a number of kick ass    s movie  except when he channels randy from scream . one character may be chris klein  s stunt double . he has a girlfriend who probably gets killed  but it  s never really established if that is true . one character is sullen and removed from her peers . . . just . . . cuz . . . and then there  s a blonde girl . yay blonde girl .  br    br   ireland has a population of  . they  re cousins . gary  who is clearly the same age or younger than the rest of the cast  is called  sir  more than once . he  s very ominous and wears a knit cap . his cousin is a roughed up porn star with the worst irish accent to befoul film in my lifetime and most likely beyond .  br    br   picturesque ireland features many canadian forests and swampy areas and  ducks which appear more than once in cut scenes .  br    br   the producers got a discount on volume fake entrails . good for them .  br    br   unbeknownst to me  horribly inbred freaks have access to brand spanking new hunting knives . perhaps there  s some kind of outdoorsman outlet nearby with a blind and deaf clerk working the register .  br    br   also unbeknownst to me  if you inbreed for roughly    years  as the story leads us to believe happened  you end up being somewhat lumpy  yet amazingly spry and fairly strong . genetics are a wonderful game of craps .  br    br   there may or may not be more than one freak in this film . reference is made to  them  and we see shadows  yet only one odd looking dude is seen ever . and when one odd looking dude is finally killed  apparently all danger is passed . i  m running with my initial assumption that no one thought to outfit a second man in full make up  thus they just used the one . that  s what it looks like on screen  anyway .  br    br   richard grieco should be ashamed .  br    br   also of note  aside from those shiny new knives  the inbred freaks have access to some posh leather gear  as once richard grieco cuts his bonds  there are fresh ones ready for the next sucker who gets tied up . . . who also then escapes  because the chains give you enough slack to just undo them  making one wonder why they even bother tying anyone up .  br    br   a dead body in a shack will be maggot  ridden after what i would guess is about  hours has passed . said dead body will also have glasses on  when no characters wore them . curious .  br    br   jenna jameson appears for no reason from stage left  chats for  minutes  vanishes stage left . in the middle of a giant forest . that  s not unusual  as gary can also pop out of nowhere  which is also known as whatever exists in tv land off the screen .  br    br   ms . jameson dies sadly and somehow her clothes vanish like my hopes that this movie wouldn  t suck wind .  br    br   i offer a special nod to the  breeder  character  the poor girl who has been used by the freaks for months  or maybe years  for breeding purposes . the poor girl who still has eye shadow on and emotes on camera with all the passion and conviction of a stuffed chihuahua .  br    br   the ending of this movie was clearly tacked on by a drunk or someone with a fierce mental disability that has been cultivated and encouraged with excessive gasoline drinking over the years .  br    br   apparently this wasn  t just random crap i found on the movie network late at night  apparently people have heard of and even followed this movie through it  s production . how sad for you all . i have nothing more to say . may god have mercy on us all .  ,0

the caprica episode  s   e    is well done as a pilot . really  this episode is the exact same content as the dvd pilot release . that having been said  episode   gives a very substantive background of the very popular  battlestar galactica  series  both the original and the     remake  . it significantly applies most to the     series . as is the trending plots of sci  fi of late  this series explores  virtual  life or environment . on top of this  we are given much background on the adama family line as well as their relationship with the unrevealed  in the battlestar galactica series  creator of the cylons . to the most part  this first episode revolves around the popular topic of  virtual  life and  as is expected  early life of the colonies  and the birth of the cylons .  br    br   over all  i rather enjoyed this episode . although  it was not new material for myself or anyone that has already seen the dvd release of the caprica pilot  the series seems very promising . as is the case with many pilots  episode   leaves us with a cliff  hanger so to ensure a follow by an audience  sci  fi community  . i  m definitely going to keep watching for resolve as well as development .  br    br   i give this series  stars .  ,1
as a big fan of gorilla movies in general  i anticipated that this one would be great  and as for the gorilla effects  they were quite good  however  that is the only thing i can write about this flop . the film claims to be based on a true story but in effect  it does not even come close to what actually happened to  buddy   who in real life  was the famous gargantua  sold to ringling bros . by our supposed  heroic  gertrude lintz  known by many animal enthusiasts as a woman who hardly had her animals  welfare in the best interest . as far as buddy being portrayed as becoming aggressive  this was total fiction and at no time did the gorilla  in real life  resort to such behavior . buddy did  in fact  escape his wooden crate  not a plush cage room as depicted in movie  during a storm  to seek shelter and comfort in the house  which frightened gertrude lintz into selling him . no  buddy was not released into a gorilla family surrounded by lush trees in a zoological paradise  he was abandoned in a wooden crate  deep in the back of a garage for some time with only a single light bulb for comfort and then sold to the circus  where he actually lived a better life having peanuts thrown at him until he died  historically the oldest living gorilla on record  by the way  before a show in miami . notice also  in the film  how buddy grows older but the chimpanzees never age .  the chimps  by the way  were not raised simultaneously with other animals  including buddy  as portrayed in the film   ,0
to sum this documentary up in a few words is next to impossible . every fiber of your body tells you that this is not happening right from the opening montage of rapid  fire images  through to the last shot of the clean up at ground zero  but every frame is real . the story was thought up by two french brothers living in new york . jules     and gideon     naudet  pronounced  nau  day   want to make a documentary on new york city firefighters  beginning with a  newbie  from the academy and follow him through the nine month probationary period to full  fledged firefighter . seeking the help of their close friend  actor james hanlon      an actor and firefighter at station   engine   the naudets sift through the  probies  at the academy and find one  tony benetakos to focus the bulk of their documentary on .  br    br   tony becomes the butt of jokes and slowly learns the ins and outs of station life through the members of this close  knit family . firefighters have a superstition about  probies .  it is that they are either  white clouds  or  black clouds   meaning that with the latter  all kinds of fires follow the  probie .  the former means that very little fire activity follows  but one day  there will be the mother of all fires . tony is a  white cloud .  after some initial growing pains  tony settles into the firehouse as if he were a seasoned vet . then the unthinkable occurs . . . .  br    br   september        begins with a clear blue sky and an early morning call to go and see about a supposed gas leak not far from wall street . because jules has had little camera experience  gideon hands a camera to his younger brother and tells him to ride with the chief  t . k . pfeiffer . arriving at about      the firefighters begin to use their gas detectors over a grate . then the sudden roar of what seems to be a low flying airplane rips past the scene  and as jules pans upwards  we see the first strike of the day . american airlines flight   smashes into the face of the north tower of  world trade . pfeiffer orders his men into the fire engine and they head for the world trade center . once there  jules asks to accompany the chief into the tower . pfeiffer tells naudet to stick close to him . once inside  the full impact of the growing disaster begins to show on the faces of the men whose sole purpose is to save lives .  br    br   gideon naudet decides to leave the firehouse and walk down to the impact area . once there  he captures the impact of the second plane  united airlines flight     with  world trade . he knows jules is with chief pfeiffer inside the towers . watching and capturing the crowds  reaction to the unimaginable  gideon begins to capture on tape the growing fear in lower manhattan . inside tower one  jules records the last view the world  or loved ones will have of their sons  fathers  uncles  grandfathers  husbands  boyfriends  friends as one by one  each firefighter  carrying   lbs of equipment begin the long arduous climb up   stories to rescue the injured and trapped . jules also catches the last glimpse chief pfeiffer will have of his brother  kevin  as he leaves to do his selfless duty . also caught on video is the gutwrenching sound of falling bodies hitting pavement from victims choosing to jump from the higher floors above the impact zones  sooner than face death at the hands of the flames and smoke . but jules is respectful  never once does he capture a sensationalistic moment . . . the money shot . his work is professional through his baptism of fire . he also catches the sight of debris falling from tower two after it is hit by the second plane and the ordered way the firefighters evacuated civilians from the building . then jules is caught in the collapse of the south tower and the first official victim is taken father michael judd  the chaplain for the fire department . then as jules and chief pfeiffer make their way from the fallout of the collapse of tower two  tower one begins its structural collapse .  br    br   what results is a breathtakingly  poignant view from inside ground zero as jules and gideon work separately to document that day . not knowing if either is alive  each fearing the worst . as each firefighter arrives at the firehouse  they greet each other with joyous hugs at having made it back . and in one moment of overwhelming emotion  jules and gideon are reunited . as jules cries on his brother  s shoulder  gideon embraces his younger brother as hanlon makes the filmmakers the subject . there is one fearful moment when tony benetakos  who left the station with a former chief  is believed to have been lost . . . but returns to the fold  this  probie  has proven himself .  br    br   shown with only three interruptions      is a stunning achievement in documentary filmmaking . it ranks up there with the hindenburg footage in showing history as it unfolds . the naudets are to be commended for their deft handling of the subject . in lesser hands  the tendency would be toward the sensational  but the naudets temper their eye toward dignity and compassion . narrated by hanlon  we get the feel of his words as he takes the audience through the events of september   . robert de niro hosts the program in a sombre  restrained way . he never seeks the camera for his own glory  rather he lays out the scenes you are about to see . i also commend cbs for their bravery at airing this special . chastised for their attempt at grabbing ratings  they temper their editing toward the emotions of the relatives of those who perished . this is a must see for anyone who needs to be reminded of what true heroism is . it isn  t about dribbling a basketball  or selling an album of hate lyrics . . .     is about humanity at its best . heroism at its finest and the cost of freedom .  br    br    ,1
i went to see this film with low expectations  but hoping to be charmed by seeing my home town on film . sadly  that  s about all i got . the story covers familiar territory  the high school reunion   but the plot is convoluted and supernatural element adds little to this well  worn theme . though the quality of the acting was good overall  the content of the film was appalling . the sexism of the film was blatant   women are apparently unfulfilled unless they are married  procreating or both  though this was couched as a post  feminist choice  . worse still was the racism   the shrill jewish mother  the black man who still lives at home   and gratuitous cruelty  tormenting the class geek  . we should be ashamed if these characters are thought to represent the inhabitants of the city of kalamazoo  and the writers should be abashed at having brought such broad and cruel stereotypes to the screen .  ,0
this is a very well  made film  meticulously directed and with some excellent character acting that at times is deeply moving  for example the scene with the loyal but unsophisticated sidekick cop and his wife . the plot is convincingly worked out and exciting . the gangster character is particularly interesting and plays an almost metaphysical role in the life of the hero . it  s made clear that the cops are just as rough and ready as the underworld characters .  br    br   a couple of slight reservations i found the ending slightly one  sided as it celebrates the hero  s successful integration into the structure of the police and justice system  which collapses the ambiguity of the police characters which has been maintained up to that point . also i found the lead female character somewhat weak little more than a catalyst for the salvation of the hero  all she seems to do is weep and swoon as the tough guys battle it out .  ,1
i totally disagree with the other reviews . all basically negative . i took a chance on this movie and was glad that i did . glad indeed . i couldn  t find anything wrong with it . nothing period . the script is original . the actors are all likable and convincing . dee smart reminded me of marcia brady from the brady bunch . but this gal truly can act . the setting in the australian outback is perfect . incredible scenery . great soundtrack i . e paul kelly . god bless paul kelly . the cranberries are also here . i have seen this movie twice in less than   hrs . i will probably watch it again . it is that interesting . it makes one think . it is  was  probably better than nine  tenths of the so  called hollywood blockbusters that were also out during this time . back of beyond is a likable . well photographed film . i couldn  t find anything wrong with it . check it out  my first review   ,1
the original movie  dated      did not show any  monster   it just suggested scary  things   .  br    br   this version however shows every aspect of a  sick minded ghost   including unnecessary special effects .  br    br   the  mystery   as presented in the original movie  was the most scary part  one simply did not know what was causing the weird things that happened . by showing the face of the  old man   this mister has completely disappeared . even worse  the special effects  crying wooden children faces  is ridiculous . this is a stupid remake  too obviously spectacular to even be close as scary as the original  ,0
this is listed as a documentary  it  s not  it  s filmed sort of like a documentary but that i suspect was just because then they get away with a shaky camera and dodgy filming . this has just been released in the uk on dvd as an  american pie style comedy  it  s not that either .  br    br   basically it follows around a group of teens on spring break as they go to mexico for cheap booze and with the quest being to get there virgin friend finally laid . throw is a couple of dwarfs  also on the same sort of quest and you have a non  hilarious tale of drunk teens trying to get some girls .  br    br   considering the   rating this has very little nudity  and practically zero sex scenes  mainly i guess the rating is for swearing of which there is plenty .  br    br   if you like crude jackass behaviour without the humour  then this may be your thing  if you have any brain cells left then i would probably avoid this   ,0
i was very impressed with this film . i would have to rate it as one of the better classic  era westerns . i say that for the whole thing the acting  mature dialog  no  nonsense story and excellent cinematography .  br    br   director anthony mann  who did several well  photographed film noirs around this same era  also made some westerns such as this one . it has that same film  noir look . mann and jimmy stewart collaborated on several westerns during this period . . if you like this movie  i recommend the mann  stewart film  bend of the river .   br    br   in a nutshell  the story is about a man   lin mcadam    stewart  who owns this prestigious winchester   rifle  a weapon he won fair  and  square in a contest . it is then stolen and passed on from villain to villain . all of those villains are interesting characters .  br    br   aiding stewart act out this interesting tale are shelley winters  dan duryea  stephen mcnally  millard mitchell  charles drake  will greer and j . c . flippen . all of them are fun to watch . it was a bit of a stretch  however  to see rock hudson playing an indian   young bull    but you can  t have everything .  ,1
i remember seeing promos for this show before it appeared back in     . i was  at the time  and now at the age of   it feels weird to have seen this cult show start and end and to look back on it . the    s all of a sudden seem so far away  what a great decade . anyway i used to watch monstervision all the time  as i am a huge fan of monster flicks and horror films . it was like the    s version of chiller theater . if mst  k can get dvd  s why not joe bob  s show  at least monstervision was more interesting and informative . a lot of joe bob  s comments and info on the films were just hilarious . most of the movies shown on the show were b or c grade but it showed a lot of a house films as well like the hammer films from england which are top notch as well as many with the stop motion majesty of ray harryhausen . many were oddball flicks that you wouldn  t see anywhere else like the the japanese sci  fi movies besides of course godzilla which is familiar to almost everyone and independent movies like metal storm and motel hell . with the new decade of film preservation and more independent minded directors  i think monstervision would be a good show for ifc to pick up  since they already have a hit with the ifc grind house show . i  m sure this show will be picked up again for nostalgia reasons some day  i guess will have to wait and see . until then  thats great television    ,1
this movie is another on the list that i did not want to see . i was talked into it and dragged into the theater  but boy am i glad for that . i thought it was going to be just another love story  but it turns out to be sooo much more than that . definatly an intellectual flick  one of those movies you have to pay attention to .  ,1
here  s another film that doesn  t really need much of a recommendation . it  s a classic comedy  very funny and entertaining and which  of course  ultimately inspired a successful television series which many would say was even better  i enjoy both  personally  .  br    br   for some  it  s hard to warm up to jack lemmon and walter matthau as felix unger and oscar madison when they were were weaned on the tv show starring tony randall and jack klugman  or perhaps vice versa  . but what we  ve got there in both cases are four good actors who in real life seemed so much like their film counterparts that they managed to make these characterizations their own . it  s neil simon  s humorous material that  s key  and where the laughs really originate from .  br    br   for those who have somehow never heard of the odd couple  it  s the story of a neurotic and fussy neat  freak  lemmon  who is thrown out of a    year marriage by his long  suffering wife and takes up residence in the manhattan apartment of his sloppy and totally irresponsible buddy  matthau  . pitting these two unlikely roommates together within the same four walls makes for some hugely funny predicaments .  ,1
this u . s soap opera   knots landing  has all the entertainment value of being trapped in an elevator . every episode contained plots such as rape  murder  kidnapping and drug smuggling  not much different to the plots of other drama shows of the period . as for the cast  i  ve seen better actors on a cereal box . from the mid to late     s  repeats of  knots  stunk up u . k  gold like a mountain of mildewing nappies . i regret to announce that i had to suffer this as my mother was a huge fan of the show and would watch it religiously . though since then  re  runs have been few and far between  let  s hope it stays that way  . the only positive thing that can be said of  knots  is the catchy saxophone signature tune  later used as the title music for the i . t . v sitcom   the upper hand  . great legacy that  eh   ,0
wow . this is really not that good .  br    br   i would like to agree with the others in that at least the acting is good . . . it is  but it is nothing special .  br    br   the movie is so precictable and i for one am sick of receiving culture info through movies .  br    br       ,0
for a mature man  to admit that he shed a tear over this film is a mature response  to a mature film .  br    br   if one need admit more then perhaps one could say that   life  can never be the same  after viewing such advent for it has moved us to the next level .  br    br    ,1
after  years of watching that dreadful nonsense called star trek voyager i was feeling pretty numb . next gen and ds  were bloody good stuff and voyager ruined tv trek . this opened with probably the best pilot to a trek show . the crew were really good as were the choice of actors for the parts . scott bakula played a typical first time captain in deep space and his unpolished way of doing things was a refreshing change to the already know everything captains from before . the rest of the crew were really likable in their roles and i think they got off to a good first season . when the show was prematurely canceled i was really disappointed . in a mirror darkly showed us what the cast were capable of . pity a film or tv movie was never considered . so much back story and founding of the federation left to tell  including the onset of hostilities with the klingons . . . . . . . . . .  ,1
actually i  m surprised there were so many comments about this movie . i saw it as part of a slavic film festival at a major american university . but nobody in usa has heard of it  which is a real shame  the dynamics between the people are what makes it both funny and sad . they are stuck together on a long bus trip   someplace most of us have been   but i never had one like this    br    br   my favorite scene is the one where they stop for the funeral . then the man  woman sneak off for some lovemaking in the forest but everybody follows them to watch without them knowing  just as she raises her skirt and he enters her all the way   the consumptive starts hacking  they realize everybody is watching   talk about surprised  but . . . you really have to feel for them even if it is hilariously funny  when you see the ending it is sort of ironic that they enjoyed themselves while they did  serb humor at it  s best   ,1
  a wrong  doer is often a man that has left something undone  not always he that has done something .    emperor marcus aurelius  br    br   the dvd release of  watch on the rhine  could not come at a better moment . it restores to us a major lillian hellman play stirringly adapted to the screen by dashiell hammett  hellman scholar bernard f . dick  s audio commentary affirms his authorship  . it presents a subtle performance by bette davis  who took a subdued secondary role long after she  d become the workhorse queen at the warner bros . lot . equally significantly  it reminds us that world war ii had a purpose .  br    br   sure  you say  like we needed that . we  ve heard cary grant sermonizing in  destination tokyo        about japanese boys and their bushido knives . we  ve watched jackboots stomp the living hills in  the sound of music        . we  ve toured an england callously occupied by germany in  it happened here        . yet  truth to tell  we still need the message spread .  br    br   i have an    year  old friend who curses franklin roosevelt regularly . he feels that fdr connived the u . s . into a foreign fight we didn  t need  and thereby caused the death of his favorite cousin . he  s encouraged in his demonizing of allied leaders and the trivializing of war two by patrick buchanan .  br    br   the political columnist has freshly released a fat book heavy with detailed research which claims that adolf hitler would have posed no further menace to poland  europe  or the world if only the third reich had been handed the free city of danzig in     . buchanan holds that if those selfish poles hadn  t confronted the nazis  drawing in foolishly meddling britain and giddily altruistic france  no war would have engulfed the west . he believes that without the rigors of total war  no one in germany would have built gas chambers to provide a final solution to the jewish problem .  br    br   some commenters on this site feel that  watch  sags under the weight of stale propaganda . maybe . however  neither my friend nor pat buchanan seem to have gotten the film  s point some people hurt and kill to grab other people  s land  goods  and liberty such people dominated the axis powers and  enough  didn  t appear in their vocabulary .  br    br   paul lukas deserved the oscar he won . he and bette davis put convincing passion into their portrayals of refugees who fight oppressors . they give emotional punch to the intellectual case for stepping off the sidelines  for actively facing down torturers and murderers . bernard dick notes that hellman didn  t care for lukas as a person since he stayed apolitical . of course  as a hungarian he had seen first  hand bela kun  s bloody  dictatorship of the proletariat  replace an outmoded empire and then topple to admiral horthy  s right  wing tyranny .  br    br   in a marvelous cameo role added to the play by hammett  henry daniell sardonically depicts a wehrmacht officer of the class that disdains the brown shirts he serves . his phili von ramme would doubtless stand with field marshal rommel in     during the plot of july   th against hitler . in april      however  he pragmatically abets the nazi cause  although he insults herr blecher  the butcher  and scorns the rumanian aristocrat teck de brancovis for trying to peddle information on an underground leader .  br    br   teck  a pauper and possible cuckold  wishes cash and a visa to return to europe where he can resume the shreds of a life that had come undone with the empire  shattering great war and the greater world  wide economic depression . he has no political convictions  no scruples about trading a freedom fighter for his own tomorrow . mercury theater graduate george coulouris lends this burnt  out case  s old world cynicism an edge of desperate menace .  br    br   lucille watson gives winsome vitality to the grasping man  s hostess  a domineering old gal who knows her mind and gets her way   but who doesn  t adequately appreciate her children and their achievements outside the home she controls . she and her pallid office  bound son belong to the american version of von ramme  s and de brancovis  privileged kind . however  this family hasn  t seen ruin and never will . they  re moneyed people who could silently advance evil simply by not opposing it .  br    br   this mother and son might easily make choices which would reflect that complaisance toward national socialism and fascism which flourishes today in my friend and in pundit buchanan .  watch on the rhine  has a manicured period look . its dialogue reflects its erudite origins on the stage rather than sounding fresh from the streets . yet hellman and hammett  s film has gut  based power . audiences still need to hear and heed its call to arms against grabbers relentlessly on the march .  ,1
   years old  this musical comedy fantasy might look its age  but it wears it with dignity .  br    br   this film is still great fun . crosby was never really romantic lead material  but he delivers the material with the lightly humorous edge it needs . bendix plays broad and is huge fun in a part which calls upon his strengths . hardwicke  how joyous for a knight of the realm  a genuine one  to throw himself into caperings like this with such abandon . and rhonda fleming enjoys herself in the least showy of the main roles . only murvyn vye disappoints as an unconvincing merlin .  br    br   though not a musical  the songs are very good  and the  dance  routine accompanying busy doing nothing is perfect  funny  appropriate  dexterous without being challenging  and making a virtue out of crosby  s musical movement which  let  s be fair  was inherently amusing due ti its never being his greatest strength .  br    br   the colour is fine  the sound is a little muddy in places .  br    br   and the story  well  it takes some liberties with the original  but i suspect that mr clemens might well have been pleased with the result .  ,1
highly recommended    br    br   a well written  funny film which will appeal to everyone out there with a sense of humour    . give it a go  it  s good to see an independent british movie more than holding it  s own against the big established studios   definitely worth adding to any film collection . there are scenes in this film that i  m sure a lot of people will be able to relate to . you will laugh out loud at the antics and enjoy the great soundtrack . i especially enjoyed the orb  s version of jimmy cliff  s vietnam and the tower of london  s take on freebird .  br    br   go on give it a go . . . . . . . . . . . . you won  t be disappointed .  ,1
what happens when someone has so much social anxiety that they cease to function  how alone can one man get  when the mundane crap we have to do in order to be part of society gets to be too much  what happens  frownland explores these questions . definitely a startling original debut from bronstein . the tone is strange and claustrophobic as we get inside the mind of a guy named keith that is so messed up he can hardly form a proper sentence . we follow him around as he tries to make contact with people and function day to day . most of us have known people like this  people that say  sorry  too much or  i appreciate it  when there  s nothing to appreciate . so we know there are people out there like this but why would someone want to make a movie about them  well  because its interesting and bronstein and the lead actor  dore mann  do an excellent job . this film is about as un  commercial as a film can get . a few friends filmed it over the course of a few years as they saved money . it was shot on   mm and the scratched film look is beautifully low budget . with no distributer  this may be a tough one to find  i think it  s been screening randomly for the past year or so . hopefully it  ll be on dvd at some point . i saw it at the silent movie theater here in la . there were   people in the audience  among them crispin glover  if that tells you anything about how weird this movie is . highly recommended .  ,1
prince stars as  the kid  in this semi  autobiographical film of a talented  but narcissistic young musician who has a less then stellar home life . true the acting leaves a tad to be desired  barring morris day and especially clarence williams who are both pitch perfect   but the movie is still great and among the best to come out of the     s . it has the best soundtrack of any movie of the last   years at least  highly quotable lines  and the dumpster scene is hilarious   plus apollonia is just simply stunning . on an unrelated not  when i saw prince in concert in     he blew down the stadium . he is an expert showman and it was one of the best concerts that i  ve experienced .  br    br   my grade a  br    br   dvd extras disc   commentary with director albert magnoli  producer robert cavallo   director of photography donald thorin theatrical trailer trailers for  under the cherry moon  and  grafitti bridge  disc   a   minute featurette on the first avenue club  purple rain bachstage pass  a half hour featurette on the movie which i  ll review later on it  s page    riffs  raffs  and revolution the impact and influence of purple rain    minute featurette   minutes of mtv  s premiere footage  when mtv didn  t suck donkey balls    prince music videos  let  s go crazy  take me with you  when doves cry  i would die  u  baby i  m a star  and purple rain    videos by the time  jungle love and the bird   and a music video for  sex shooter  by apollonia   br    br   eye candy apollonia shows her fine ass titties  ,1
this show is without a doubt one of the greatest shows ever to be on television . i mean the acting is great  the suspense  the drama  the comedy  it has everything  and with such a simple story a plane crashed on an island . the characters are great and evangeline lilly is hot       matthew fox once again shows us what a great actor he is  josh holloway is so great  jorge garcia is hilarious  i could go on and on . also  the unexpected plot twists  the back stories of the characters  the music that is at the end of every episode . j . j . abrahms has once again proved what an excellent writer and producer he is . i mean this is better than alias  and i loved alias . whoever isn  t watching this show  should definitely consider getting the dvd  s and watching it  because they are missing something great . this show could possibly be the best show in television history    ,1
i loved the original . it was brilliant and always will be . strangely though  i actually looked forward to seeing the re  make . i  m usually a little bit against re  makes because there  s far too many of them  but somehow this intrigued me . i was really enjoying it to begin with . caine brilliant  as usual  and jude law managing to hold is own next to him . it was quite clever how it was modernised and it was working . what stops this from being really good is the last seven minutes . it goes completely away from the original  so far in fact that is ceases to be clever and just gets annoying . the end in the original was fantastic  so much tension was built up and it was unbelievably clever  this  it grows not in tension but in frustration as it seemed they decided to make caine  s character a homosexual . it was if they were trying far to hard to be different . and then . . . bang  law  s dead . roll credits . this film is worth the watch simply for the performances  but those last seven minutes really do drag it down . what a pity . . . .  ,0
with these people faking so many shots  using old footage  and gassing animals to get them out  not to mention that some of the scenes were filmed on a created set with actors  what  s to believe  old film of countries is nice  but the animal abuse and degradation of natives is painful to watch in these films . i know  racism is ok in these old films  but there is more to that to make this couple lose credibility . portrayed as fliers  they never flew their planes  martin johnson was an ex  vaudevillian  used friends like jack london for financial gain while stiffing them of royalties  denying his wife  s apparent depression  using her as a cute prop  all this makes these films unbearable . they were by no means the first to travel to these lands  or the first to write about them . he was ok as a filmmaker and photographer  but that  s about it .  ,0
even in a bad film  there is usually some redeeming feature  something that you can say yes it was terrible  but there was that performance  or that part of the script  or that special effect  this was just simply terrible all over . the acting was laughable  the script terrible  complete with many inexplicable breakfast at tiffany  s references  and even the special effects were shoddy at best . this was a very bad film and one that even drew barrymore wishes was expunged from history . watch it if you want to a  suffer harsh self inflicted pain . b  see just how bad a film can be . this is one film where i can use the clich  there  s ninety minutes of my life i will never get back  with some justification   ,0
tachigui the amazing lives of the fast  food grifters japanese title tachiguishi retsuden  br    br   director mamoru oshii featuring toshio suzuki  mako hyodo  kenji kawai  shinji higuchi  katsuya terada narrated by koichi yamadera                                          br    br   way back in      mamoru oshii unleashed his dazzling animation feature ghost in the shell  which helped consolidate anime  s international acceptance  and also burrowed itself into andy and larry wachowski  s overall concept for the matrix .  br    br   the movie  s sequel  innocence        was the inaugural japanese animated film to compete for the palme d  or at cannes  and it left heads spinning as much for its style and innovative effects as for its oft unfathomable plot .  br    br   always the trendsetter  oshii has now presented us with tachigui the amazing lives of the fast  food grifters  which has absolutely nothing to do with ghost in the shell  nor japanese anime for that matter .  br    br   say hello to oshii  s creation  superlivemation   not quite animation  nor exactly live  action . instead the cast endured somewhere in the vicinity of       snapshots  which were digitally processed and reconstituted in a deceptively simple paper cut  out fashion reminiscent of balinese puppetry . the movement itself is a stilted  stop  motion style that echoes sequences from shinya tsukamoto  s experimental tetsuo iron man       .  br    br    i couldn  t think of any method but this one   said oshii in a recent interview with the daily yomiuri .  i realized that this project was not suitable for traditional animation .   br    br   the cast choice is equally enigmatic . kenji kawai  who also composed the superlative soundtrack  appears as a ravenous burger fanatic  while renowned studio ghibli producer toshio suzuki spends his screen time being murdered in bizarre fashion . others include katsuya terada  who dabbled with oshii on blood the last vampire  and shinji higuchi  a special effects whiz who  s worked on godzilla movies .  br    br   koichi yamadera  s narration sounds like the stuff of a dry nhk documentary  which belies the comic undertone here as well as yamadera  s extensive career voicing stoic anime characters like spike siegel in cowboy bebop .  br    br   and the plot itself is a bizarre re  imagining of post  wwii japan in the context of various fast  food off  shoots  from soba ramen shops to gyudon stand  up bars american dogs in the heat  up trays of convenience stores to mcdonalds  inspired burger  chain restaurants .  food is a primal root of desire   asserted oshii  by way of explanation .  br    br   thrown into the mix is a new breed of consumer the fast  food grifters of the title  people who don  t like to pay for their tucker and are constantly fine  tuning their elaborate scams to score free munchies .  br    br   oshii said his ulterior motive was homage to the  art  of eating food on the streets  something still considered a bit of a taboo in this country  and which goes some way toward explaining the use of  tachigui  in the title .  br    br   the director of live  action movies  avalon  stray dog  as well as animation  oshii has often blurred the definition between the two mediums . the celluloid result here is deposited somewhere in the grey area between both formats .  br    br   at times the visual experiment here is as exhilarating as it can be irritating . just don  t ask what it  s all really supposed to mean oshii  s films  which are equal parts cerebral and innovative  are often not particularly clear story  wise . where oshii succeeds is via a liberal dose of black humor  here you  ll find kentucky fried rat  death by hula  hoop  the world  s fastest samurai burger chef  and in the movie  s very nature of surrealism .  br    br   this is a man who defers to the influence of filmmakers like godard and truffaut  and perhaps owes as much to andrei tarkovsky as he does david lynch . so it shouldn  t come as any surprise that at one stage a b    bomber does a fly  through in a yoshinoya look  alike franchise . the    year  old writer  director seemed to think this natural .  the japan i depicted in the movie may not necessarily be faithful to reality   he suggested .  br    br   of course .                br    br   by andrez bergen  ,1

i don  t usually write a comment when there are so many others but this time i feel i have to . i have spoken of taste in another review  saying it  s all in the eye of the beholder but when it comes to this film  if you like it  it simply means you have bad taste .  br    br   i love films . i loved  isle of the dead  which is pretty much an unknown bw film . i even liked  scream  and  scary movie  i liked these films because they have  if not a lot  at least something good about them . i appreciate   .   of the films i  ve seen because they tell a story which i haven  t heard before  and most directors only make films with a good storyline . throughout this film i was thinking  where is this going    even near the end   where did they get these awful actors from    was that supposed to be a joke   and suchlike . with the obvious twist looming i was sceptical  but hoped it would perhaps  make  the film and prove i hadn  t wasted my time . i was sadly mistaken . the storyline was bad to begin with and the twist actually ruined any glimmer of hope there was . here  s a rundown storyline  much like the first film  which was alright  this one is slow and sparse with no audience relation to the characters or the situations . the situations are cringeworthy and shallow and completely boring and predictable . the twist was terrible  it didn  t make me feel a thing  like excitement or wow . just  my god .  there was nothing in the bulk of the film that you could look back to and think  oooo wasn  t that clever  because it wasn  t . in  fight club  there are flashbacks at the end showing bits where tyler  s true identity was cryptically shown  and when you watched it again you saw more  it really was a work of genius  how it was written  laid out and directed . this was a meaningless attempt at an awesome twist . i think it was  wild things  that had like a pretty poor double twist and i still liked the film because the rest was ok and it wasn  t trying too hard to be a big twist . its like the ci  writer thought it was gonna be the best twist ever . but really  its just a bad story with a bad twist dumped on the end . the film ended almost immediately afterward  with the whole film void by sebastian  s whole story build up meaning nothing and a horrible half forced  paedophilic ending with a particularly young and innocent acting girl . acting  the actors in this film are appalling . almost as bad a  sunset beach .   extremely corny and badly performed . it  s not even so bad it  s good like  hunk  . the worst acting i thought came from amy adams who played kathryn  it was a rigid  pathetic and badly thought out performance by her . robin dunne was also poor . i haven  t seen  american psycho ii  yet  but no doubt his laid back  cool  style has ruined that film also .  br    br   i can  t even say it is a good film for teens  as its not . if my son or daughter liked this film i  d be ashamed . but they wouldn  t anyway  as they would take into consideration all the things that make a good film  which this film has none of . really . i  m disappointed that some have said  you might not be in the age bracket for this film  and so dislike it  i like all the films now that i liked as a teen and had very good taste . also  do you really think that when you reach    you suddenly don  t like any teenish story lines  no . i liked  mean girls  and other generic teen films  and watch  beverly hills       all the time . there  s no excuse for poor directing  acting and screenplay i  m afraid . besides  i was      when i first watched it . if anything  being older just makes you a better judge of a terrible film . i can  t believe anyone can give it      either  one of my favourite films is  memento  and i gave it  as i know there can be better . it is a shame for this site that people do that  give   s flippantly  or don  t get the films  show  and so give it  .  br    br   anyone who liked this film really should vary their taste  and perhaps their lives  and with this realise that this is the worst film ever made .  worse than  loch ness    br    br   if you aren  t a teenager with bad taste  or simply don  t have bad taste you will absolutely hate this film .  ,0
difficult film to comment on  how do you say it  s bad  well it isn  t  but then it  s equally difficult to say it is good . what it is  is compelling viewing  it is as close as you will get to utter devastation without being there . it is the photographs of the tsunami approaching the coast of thailand brought to life  you know you want to turn away but you have to watch .  br    br   the naudet brothers handle the commentary very well  even in the most tragic of circumstances  there view on something which is happening in another country neither panders nor insults . the facts are on the cellulose and little is needed for the viewer to understand or comprehend what is going on .  br    br   you can  t change history  and you should not want  this film stands as a testament to humanity in its darkest hour .  ,1
some people loved  the aristocrats  and others hated it  frequently walking out in the middle . reactions to eddie izzard aren  t likely to be that extreme   if you can handle a transvestite comedian  who says he likes girls  and has a vocabulary that makes  shall we say  enough use of the  f  word that his program would be one long beep if presented on network television . many of izzard  s fans are so devoted that they see no flaws whatsoever in his performances . on the other hand  i thought this show was occasionally flatter than izzard  s chest but also more often than not funny and  in spots  absolutely hilarious . he has a way of connecting references from routines early in the show to his later routines . he  s not a story teller . he  s not a joke maker . he  s not a frenetic fantasist like robin williams . he plays around with ideas  some of which work and some of which   a routine with the san francisco cable car and alcatraz  for instance   are completely unfunny . he has a way  however  of moving gracefully past the flopped routines and extending the ones that connect . i gave this performance a  and might be persuaded to raise it to an  . but a    no way .  ,1
i think the deal with this movie is that it has about  minutes of really  really funny moments and it makes a very good trailer and a lot of people came in with expectations from the trailer and this time the movie doesn  t live up to the trailer . it  s a little more sluggish and drags a little slowly for such an exciting premise  and i think i  m seeing from the comments people having a love  hate relationship with this movie .  br    br   however  if you look at this movie for what it is and not what it could have been considering the talent of the cast  i think it  s still pretty good . julia stiles is clearly the star  she  s so giddy and carefree that set among the conformity of everyone else  she just glows and the whole audience falls in love with her along with lee . the rest of the cast  of course  lee  s testosterone  filled coworkers  his elegant mother  in  law  his fratlike friend jim and his bride  to  be all do an excellent job of fitting into stereotypes of conformity and boringness that make stiles stand out in the first place .  br    br   lee doesn  t live up to his costars  i don  t think  but you could view that as more that they  re hard to live up to . maybe that  s one source of disappointment .  br    br   the movie itself  despite a bit of slowness and a few jokes that don  t come off as funny as the writer  s intended  is still pretty funny and i found a rather intelligent film . the themes of conformity and  taking the safe route  seemed to cleverly align on several layers . for example  there was the whole motif of how he would imagine scenarios but would never act on them until the last scene  or how he was listening to a radio program on the highway talking about how everyone conforms  or just how everything selma blair and julia stiles  characters said and did was echoed by those themes of one person being the safe choice and one being the risky choice .  br    br   the other good thing about the movie was that it was kind of a screwball comedy in which jason lee has to keep lying his way through the movie and who through dumb luck  example the pharmacy guy turning out to be a good chef  and some cleverness on his part gets away with it for the most part .  br    br   while it wasn  t as funny as i expected and there was a little bit of squandered talent  but overall it  s still a good movie .  ,1
if you didn  t enjoy this movie  either your dead  or you hate adam sandler or don cheadle .  br    br   an excellent cast  all of who gave good performances . this movie proved that adam sandler is good actor  despite what critics say . adam sandler is becoming a very well respected actor . it all started with his performance in big daddy  then he did a couple bad movies  then he broke through with terrific performance in   first dates  the longest yard  then click  and now reign over me .  br    br   back to the movie . adam sandler plays a man who has lost everything . the closest thing to family he has are a mother  in  law and father  in  law . after his old college roommate  cheadle  ran into him  he seems to turn his life around . i will say no more  because i do not want to ruin the movie  but i strongly recommend this movie . one of the best movies of     .  ,1
i couldn  t wait to receive the dvd after hearing so much about the film . what a disappointment  this became one of the most confusing films i  ve ever viewed . there were so many characters introduced  some resembling others  that it became impossible to follow the story line . i could not understand how george clooney received an acting award for the film since he was hardly involved  at least in the first half of the movie . my wife and i gave up after about an hour of misery and stopped the dvd . i might have considered fast forwarding to see if the ending was any better but after so much confusion decided that chances for improvement were slim . a co  worker told me that a lot of the movie  comes together  in the last minute or less . i was glad i didn  t waste another hour  waiting . i gave the dvd away the following day .  ,0
really an amazing pile of pap   br    br   a predictable  slow moving  soul destroying  mind numbing movie to which  slitting your own wrists with a rusty bread knife seems . . . well  almost necessary .  br    br   the acting is over done for the thin dialogue  every scene is at least twice as long as it needs to be  the intricate details of how this career is collapsing or that career is rising is just far too dreary and mundane for words . the music would be good if you didn  t have to sit through the movie  but really  three good songs is not enough reward for the effort required to watch the movie .  br    br   watching this film i prayed to god for narcolepsy or for someone to shoot me .  br    br   never  ever  ever again .  ,0
i have to admit i have always found it difficult to watch an antonioni film from start to finish at the first try  and even for this one  i ended up watching it in three parts on repeated occasions . in the end  i realised perhaps it was better that way  because it forced me to stop thinking in the usual terms of plot and just enjoy the scenes one by one .  br    br   the first part seems a lot more fragmentary  which is not a bad thing  it just requires more of an effort to follow . when it gets to the desert scenes  all efforts are repaid in full . the stunning cinematography is only a part of it  what really makes it all unforgettable is how the landscape is made into an overwhelming presence  the silence and vastness of it  the sense of sadness and freedom  the way it fuses and contrasts with the two young characters . the desert is dead  but at the same time it feels less distant and alien than the urban scenes in the first part . the dance between the airplane flying over and the girl  s car makes for a series of great shots . the love scenes in the desert are simply beautiful  it is hard to imagine this kind of approach from a film of our times . there is of course something very stylish and studied about them  but at the same time they manage to express a sense of natural  spontaneous innocence that is very rare these days . it all feels loose and unscripted  thanks also to the understated acting   but that is the result of a maniacal attention to detail and form  which comes to its climax in the series of explosions at the end  a really mesmerising spectacle . it just leaves you in awe .  br    br   i don  t really care for some the usual objections boring  well  yes  it is  if you want all films to follow a classic plot development and be packed with action twists  but then if all cinema was like that  that would be truly dull and sad pretentious  maybe  but when that kind of ambitiousness is coupled with actual skills  depth  and style  pretentious is a compliment . the  political  criticisms make the least sense to me  i don  t see the point of approaching a film like this with ideological blinders or worse  patriotic requirements . it just defeats the purpose . perhaps it  s true that  like a previous commenter remarked  antonioni viewed these young  hippies  and the politics of protests and riots with the police with the fascination of a foreigner  but i think that adds something rather than detracting from the film . it  s not true that hippies did not exist in italy at the time  think of the    protests  like in france   although they were obviously different from the american counterpart and in some ways even more militant . but his interest in this film was not narrowly political . the events seem more like a pretext for a film whose appeal has a universal  timeless quality .  br    br   a special mention for the fantastic soundtrack . amongst other things  this film  along with easy rider  is probably one of the main earliest precursors of the contemporary  artsy  music video as well as the concept of a film soundtrack that would stand on its own  but unlike the former  it uses music in a much more subtle way  blending it with the landscape rather than the action .  br    br   if you want traditional narrative in a film  then don  t bother . if you want to be stunned  be patient and you won  t regret it .  ,1
i only lasted   mins before self preservation jerked me out of the empty eyed drooling stupor that this film effortlessly induced and propelled me screaming back to the video shop armed for bear .  br    br   to say the film was bad would be a missed opportunity to use words interspersed with characters from the top keys on my keyboard  just to keep these comments clean  .  br    br   one to be avoided .  br    br    ,0
i happened to see this movie twice or more and found it well made  wwii had freshly ended and the so  called  cold war  was about to begin . this movie could  therefore  be defined as one of the best  propaganda   patriotic movies preparing americans and  secondly  people from the still to be formed  western nato block  of countries to face the next coming menace . the movie celebrates the might of the us  through the centuries  while projecting itself onwards to the then present war  which had just ended . nice and funny is the way of describing the discovering of the american continent by columbus and pretty the  espisode  of new amsterdam and the purchasing of manhattan from a drunk local indian . . must see it  at least once  for curiosity of fashion of propaganda through time      ,1
this early role for barbara shelley  in fact  her first in britain after working in italy   was made when she was   years old  and it  s certainly safe to say that she made a stunning debut in      s  cat girl .  while blondes and brunettes get most of the attention  i  ll always cherish yutte stensgaard   the lovely auburn  haired actress with the deep voice always exuded intelligence as well as vulnerability  one such example being      s  village of the damned   in which her screen time was much less than her character  s husband  george sanders  . she is the sole reason for seeing this drab update of  cat people   and is seen to great advantage throughout  it  s difficult to say if her beauty found an even better showcase  . her character apparently sleeps in the nude  and we are exposed to her luscious bare back when she is awakened  also exposed  years later in      s  rasputin  the mad monk   . the ravishing gown she wears during most of the film is a stunning strapless wonder  i don  t see what held that dress up  but i  d sure like to  . all in all  proof positive that barbara shelley  in a poorly written role that would defeat most actresses  rises above her material and makes the film consistently watchable  a real test of star power  which she would find soon enough at hammer  s studios in bray  for the duration of the      s .  ,0
greta garbo  s american film debut is an analogy of how our lives can be swept off course by fate and our actions  as in a torrent  causing us to lose a part of ourselves along the way .  br    br   greta plays leonora  a poor peasant girl in love with ricardo cortez  s character don rafael  a landowner . ricardo is in love with her too  but is too easily influenced by his domineering mother . leonora ends up homeless and travels to paris  where she becomes a famous opera singer and develops the reputation for being a loose woman . in reality  part of her attitude is bitterness over rafael  s abandonment .  br    br   she returns to her home to visit her family and eventually confronts rafael . surprisingly  no one knows that she  s the famous la brunna  and garbo acts up her role as the diva she truly was and re prised with such cool haughtiness in her later portrayals .  br    br   ricardo cortez reminds one a lot of valentino in looks in this part  and he was groomed to be a valentino clone by mgm  though he never thought he could be in reality and he was right . he is believable in an unsympathetic part as a weak willed mama  s boy  and allows himself to age realistically but comically at the end of the movie . he fails to win leonora when she returns home  and later when he follows her  his courage is undermined .  br    br   this movie is beautifully shot  with brilliant storm sequences and the sets depicting spain at the time are authentic looking . there are also some fine secondary performances by old timers lucien littlefield  tully marshall  and mack swain .  br    br   although this is a story of lost love and missed chances  i don  t think leonora and rafael would have been happy together  as he needed a more traditional wife and she was very much a career woman  and i don  t think would have been happy in a small village . the ending is true to life and pulls no punches .  br    br   see this one as garbo  s american film debut and a precursor of things to come  ,1
i love killer insects movies they are great fun to watch  i had to watch this movie as it was one of my favourite horror books by shaun hutson .  br    br   i have met him and i wish i did listen to him as this movie was terrible like he said it was  after he said that i was still dying to see how bad it was .  br    br   the plot people are dying mysteriously and gruesomely  and nobody has a clue what the cause is .  br    br   only health worker mike brady has a possible solution  but his theory of killer slugs is laughed at by the authorities .  br    br   only when the body count begins to rise and a slug expert from england begins snooping around does it begin to look like mike had the right idea after all .  br    br   this movie as the most overacting you ever see a movie  slugs in this movie are fast  then normal  and it looks like they fast forwarding the scenes   br    br   this movie is nothing like the book at all  the book was ten times scarier  ten times gory and had a lot more story to it   br    br   i didn  t like this movie at all  as i am huge fan of slugs the book and second book called breeding ground  both of books are great  br    br   read the book then watch the movie  you may like more then i did give this  out    ,0
the jist see something else .  br    br   this film was highly rated by gene siskel  but after watching it i can  t figure out why . the film is definitely original and different . it even has interesting dialogue at times  some cool moments  and a creepy  noir  feel . but it just isn  t entertaining . it also doesn  t make a whole lot of sense  in plot but especially in character motivations . i don  t know anyone that behaves like these characters do .  br    br   this is a difficult movie to take on   i suggest you don  t accept the challenge .  ,1
the hills have eyes ii is what you would expect it to be and nothing more . of course it  s not going to be an oscar nominated film  it  s just pure entertainment which you can just lose yourself in for   minutes .  br    br   the plot is basically about a group of national guard trainees who find themselves battling against the notorious mutated hillbillies on their last day of training in the desert . it  s just them fighting back throughout the whole film  which includes a lot of violence  which is basically the whole film  as blood and guts are constantly flying around throughout the whole thing  and also yet another graphic rape scene which is pointlessly thrown in to shock the audience .  br    br   i  d give the hills have eyes ii  out of   for pure entertainment  and that only . although even then i found myself looking at my watch more and more as the film went on  as it began to drag due to the fact it continued to try and shock the audience with graphic gore and the occasional jump scene just to make sure the audience stays awake . the hills have eyes ii is just decent entertainment  something to pass time if you  re bored  and nothing else .  br    br        ,0
i work at a blockbuster store and every week we have movies that come in with just a few copies  these are the kind of movies that the sci  fi channel shows . the kind of movie that nobody ever wants  and only that idiots rent  when they bring it back i ask them  was it any good    they say  no we turned it off after   minutes   movies with terrible computer generated  super imposed monsters and such like  very unappealing .  br    br   this is the same type of movie that grendel is  and absolute waste of time  if you want a reasonably  and only reasonably  good beowulf based movie then try beowulf  grendel  starring gerard butler  who is also starring in the eagerly anticipated     as king leonidas of sparta .  br    br   plus  later this year we have another beowulf movie  with a star studded cast ranging from anthony hopkins and brendan gleeson  to angelina jolie and john malkovich .  br    br   but don  t let that get your hopes up like we all did with eragon  or we are all in for another big disappointment .  br    br   and regarding rentals  here is my rule of thumb if there is only one or two copies  don  t rent it because its a load of crap .  this is true   .   of the time  usually not true if the title is foreign  or a documentary .   ,0
in the tradition of g  men  the house on   nd street  the street with no name  now comes the fbi story one of those carefully supervised films that showed the federal bureau of investigation in the best possible light . while it  s   year director j . edgar hoover was alive  it would be showed in no other kind of light .  br    br   the book by don whitehead that this film is based on is a straight forward history of the bureau from it  s founding in     until roughly the time the film the fbi story came out . it  s important sometimes to remember there was an fbi before j . edgar hoover headed it . some of that time is covered in the film as well .  br    br   but warner brothers was not making a documentary so to give the fbi flesh and blood the fictional character of john  chip  hardesty was created . hardesty as played by james stewart is a career fbi man who graduated law school and rather than go in practice took a job with the bureau in the early twenties .  br    br   in real life the bureau was headed by william j . burns of the burns private detective agency . it was in fact a grossly political operation then as is showed in the film . burns was on the periphery of the scandals of the harding administration . when hoover was appointed in     to bring professional law enforcement techniques and rigorous standards of competence in  he did just that .  br    br   through the hardesty family which is stewart and wife vera miles we see the history of the fbi unfold . in addition we see a lot of their personal family history which is completely integrated into the fbi  s story itself . stewart and miles are most assuredly an all american couple . we follow the fbi through some of the cases stewart is involved with  arresting ku klux klan members  a plot to murder oil rich indians  bringing down the notorious criminals of the thirties  their involvement with apprehending nazi sympathizers in world war ii and against communist espionage in the cold war .  br    br   there is a kind of prologue portion where stewart tells a class at the fbi academy before going into the history of the bureau as it intertwines with his own . that involves a bomb placed on an airline by a son who purchased a lot of life insurance on his mother before the flight . nick adams will give you the creeps as the perpetrator and the story is sadly relevant today .  br    br   of course if the fbi story were written and produced today it would reflect something different and not so all american . still the fbi does have a story to tell and it is by no means a negative one .  br    br   the fbi story is not one of jimmy stewart  s best films  but it  s the first one i ever saw with my favorite actor in it so it has a special fondness for me . if the whole fbi were made up jimmy stewarts  i  d feel a lot better about it . there  s also a good performance by murray hamilton as his friend and fellow agent who is killed in a shootout with baby face nelson .  br    br   vera miles didn  t just marry stewart  she in fact married the fbi as the film demonstrates . it  s dated mostly  but still has a good and interesting story to tell .  ,1
you talking  to me        is a pretty bad movie starring some dude who i have never seen before or since starring as a guy from the neighborhood who tries to become an actor . he has a heavy jones for taxi driver as tries to use that shtick to make it big . when he learns the hard facts of life  he does what everyone else does  changes his image  he goes from good fella to a surf  s up dude over night . his friend can  t believe the change  but he scores with faith ford and get  s a cool paying gig  . can this young punk keep his street cred whilst making it big   br    br   this is a real lame movie that tries too hard to incorporate too many things at once . an interesting idea that falls apart due to poor execution . who knows  maybe somebody will pick up the ball and run because the film makers fumbled the ball this time .  br    br   don  t waste your time with this movie . unless you want to see a hot faith ford and a young bubba from forest gump .  br    br   xx  ,0
i had to watch this film because the plot was so outrageous and the film lived up to expectations . in fact it makes for quite uncomfortable viewing at times . unlike other meyer films  the sexual antics are down to a minimum . some of the scenes of violence are unnecessarily gratuitous and offensive . the plot is chaotic and some of the acting and lines are dreadful .  br    br   the film is a strange combination of sado  masochistic fantasy combined with a window of the brutality and immorality of the slavery and fails on all counts . it  s as though meyer was trying to make up for the sexploitation  blackploitation by having a higher moral message . meyer knows we feel a bit guilty about getting turned on by the blatant dominatrix connotations of the early scene showing lady susan wielding a whip in a provocative outfit . he then tries to steer back to the righteous path by turning it into a film about the triumph of good over evil . however  because they cancel each other out  you end up with nothing .  br    br   because it so bad in so many ways  it is actually worth watching if you appreciate the art of making an awful film in the worst possible taste . perhaps  because it is so bad  we almost let meyer get away with the unacceptable .  ,0
ettore scola is one of the most important italian directors . my parents and i watched together  c  eravamo tanto amati  on a summer night we liked it  but we didn  t love it as we loved  a special day  . i believe ettore scola is pretty underrated we often forget to remember him  maybe because his latest films were disappointing . and so  yesterday night  my mum and i sat on our sofa to enjoy this masterpiece . writing  direction  cinematography  score and production design were sober and accurate  but the thing i liked the most was the chemistry between loren and mastroianni . they  re both excellent actors and play the main roles of antonietta and gabriele . antonietta is an housewife married with a fanatic fascist  she has six children but her husband wants to have another child to get a prize for the huge families . gabriele is simply an anti  fascist . they spend together a special day  that special day of     when hitler came to rome visiting mussolini . i don  t want to spoil anymore about the plot go looking for this film   ,1
john ford is one of the most influential and best remembered american filmmakers in the history of film  his name usually associated with the western film genre . however  john ford  s arguably best film is not a western at all but a seedy drama set in the irish fight for independence in the early     s      s the informer .  br    br   times are tough on many in ireland and the burnt out gypo nolan is caught in a web of poverty and desperation  and the walls are closing in . gypo is big but he is not the brightest bulb on the tree  has a warm heart but a short fuse  and never seems to really think things all the way through but he is not a criminal or a self  centered pig . walking the streets starving with no where to live  the hulking gypo nolan finds the prime lady in his life  katie madden  on the streets soliciting herself because of her own desperate situation and starts to dream about taking her to the united states if he only had the   pounds to pay for it . as luck would have it  his friend frankie is back in town with a   pound price over his head and gypo is desperate enough to inform the police of frankie  s whereabouts . gypo  with the new   pounds of blood money earned  finds this foggy night particularly foggier as guilt swells all over him and the ira invests all their resources to find frankie  s informer .  br    br   victor mclaglen portrays the fallen gypo nolan and definitely deserved the best actor oscar he was awarded for this film . his brutish  stupid  and tender turns give the character dimension and mclaglen is only second to dudley moore  s character arthur bach from the     film arthur as the most entertaining cinematic drunk . margot grahame  s performance as katie madden is also excellent but she and mclaglen are the only members of the cast who truly impress . preston foster is especially miscast as an ira head  mainly because he is most obviously not irish  and j . m . kerrigan borders on irritating throughout his role in the film but this disappointing supporting cast is the film  s only poor point .  br    br   often overshadowed by some of ford  s better known westerns like the searchers or the man who shot liberty valance  the informer is easily one of john ford  s best films  if not his very best . beginning what would be a long career of oscar nominations and wins for john ford  the informer won four oscars including one for him for best director in     . ford and company  s use of shadows and light in the film is particularly engaging and vital to telling the story . gypo  s walk through the streets is narrated by the gloomy state of the town and the glaring accusations of the street lamps  each shadow constantly reminding him of his dark deed . ford  s command of this technique was amazing to watch if the informer was made   years later  thus making the genre requirements  it would probably be considered one of the best films noir of all time but that does not hinder it from being remembered as an excellent classic film .  ,1
i just wondering what is the purpose of making movies like this  the profit  and to whom they are referring what intelligence must use your brain to watch something like this crap  this movie is watchable by under  years old children if you are adults don  t try to watch it . thats the reason i think hollywood started to use cartoons in movies with actors like this you must forget the art of cinema  be sure that you ll have tons of pop corn to consume for time to pass till this movie ends also get many cola  s hamburgers your laptop your cellphone this movie can be used easily in a restaurant but for sure not in a theater  my dog who is always next to my family when watching a movie left the building . the sure thing is that this movie is referring to people with no demands from the cinema art . the only thing that this movie can be used is for watching it when making the supermarket shopping list . i am giving  stars for supporting the india  s cinema efforts but for nothing more or less . .  ,0
let me put it another way balls . or  how about bolloks . this is truly awful  more embarrassing than those it attempts to satirise . julia roberts is a skilled actress  and usually her work is of the highest standard . this movie is so lacking in direction even she struggles to look proficient . normally she is the consummate professional  yet i swear that in her eyes  there were signs of bewilderment and despair .  br    br   the one thing that might have rescued this move was the idea about the director  chris walken  turning the movie into a secret documentary about the actors . unfortunately  that theme wasn  t explored to it  s full potential . too little  too late .  br    br   zeta jones was wooden  cusack was cusack  and crystal should stick to acting . the two talented ex  buffy stars had different experiences  green hopelessly mis  cast  and balfour under  used . well done to julia for just about preventing this from being the worst movie ever made .  ,0
macy  ullman and sutherland were as great as usual . ritter wasn  t bad either . what  s her name was as pretty as usual . it could have been a good movie . to bad the plot was atrocious . it was completely predictable  trite and boring .  br    br   from the first   minutes  the rest of the movie was laid out like a child  s paint by numbers routine . the characters were stock pieces of cut out cardboard . there was nothing new or interesting to say and that completely outweighed the acting  which was a pity .  br    br   finally  too bad the script writer wasn  t the victim . especially with the  precocious  lines from the child  which were completely unbelievable .  br    br   again  it  s only the acting that prevented a much lower score .  ,0
i guess i  m part of the silent minority who enjoyed this film . is it one of the best of the  nightmare  series  maybe not  but i had lots of fun with it . freddy krueger reaches his evil  wisecracking potential . since parts  and  kind of lagged the series down  i felt this so  called final installment   new nightmare  is the real finale  brought the series out of its slump . there are some great nightmare sequences  including one where breckin meyer plays a stoner who gets trashed  falls asleep and gets stuck in a video game to which freddy controls . this is both a highly original and hilarious sequence  especially when we see him out of the dreamscape  hopping around like super mario . and freddy belts out the funny one  liner   great graphics .  and since the movie was made about   years ago  it brought back memories when freddy started controlling the game with the powerglove . anyone who remembers the first   bit nintendo remembers the powerglove .  br    br   the cast is superb . lisa zane is perfectly cast in the lead . i haven  t seen yaphet kotto since  the running man   and i think the last time i saw that film was about  years ago . he  s another great  underappreciated actor who possesses a powerful screen presence . and who can forget the cameos  the best one is by johnny depp  from the first  nightmare   playing a spokesman for an anti  drug commercial .  br    br   the  d sequence at the end is really awesome  so for those who are looking to check this film out   please rent or buy it on dvd  hopefully all the editions come with the  d glasses  but i  m sure the video edition has the  d element removed .  br    br   i personally didn  t see many things wrong with the film . it even elaborated on freddy  s backstory . the film is a great mix of humor and scares  and the gross  out effects are terrific . could this have given better justice to the franchise  of course it could have . but rachel talalay did a fine job . and finding the perfect conclusion is easier said than done .  br    br   and in closing  i loved the montage over the opening credits . fans of the series will be delighted  and will look at it as a tribute to beloved freddy .  br    br   my score   out of     ,1
first of all  i would just like to say to everyone who has seen this movie  that the actor who played the  transvestite  is one of my friends  his name is robert dugdale  he  s a terrific actor  although it doesn  t say much about his filmography  he  s been in several plays and musicals . he is currently residing in terrace b . c . that is where i am from  he comes over to our house almost every saturday laughs okay  now about the movie  i wouldn  t recomend this to anyone who hasn  t seen it  for it is not a movie worth watching  the main reason i found it to be a bad movie is it never stays in place  it keeps bouncing back between time  so kinda hard to follow at some points  and second  its really boring laughs although the acting is great  the movie just doesn  t compare .  ,0
  arahan  adds nothing positive to the kung fu genre . to compare this confused motion picture with the inspired craziness and quality of stephen chow  s films is a mistake .  br    br   firstly the fight scenes are nothing new . all that is presented here has been done before and better by the likes of yimou zhang  tony jaa and jackie chan . fights in intelligent motion pictures need logic . there seems no point serving blows that have no damaging effect as in the  matrix  sequels .  br    br   the attractive female lead so  yi yoon captivated the screen but she never convincingly conquered the physical demands of the role as ziyi zhang had done so easily in  house of flying daggers  . having a martial arts background serves well in kung fu movies . to cast actors inexperienced in these skills is a serious mistake  see aya ueto in  asumi   unless you are a very talented director which as  arahan  proves seung  wan ryoo is not .  ,0
i have never panned a film on  line  but i felt moved to do so  after seeing this one . one doesn  t show up at someone  s funeral and say to the bereaved   my relatives died  so why should i care about yours    br    br   minus the propaganda  there was little  if anything  that could be called  art .  as the daughter of deaf parents  i was particularly annoyed by the use of deafness as a gimmick . any deaf person feeling a vibration of that immensity would likely have investigated  not ignored it .  br    br   the word  chutzpah  comes to mind . as a writer  there are few subjects i would stay away from the holocaust is one this is another . i wish these movie makers had not been so arrogant  and inept  .  ,0
i found myself very caught up in this movie  at least at the beginning  and any credit i give to this movie  is lacey chabert  she was fantastic   but thats where it ends . i seem to be very good at figuring out who the killer is  and i like it when a movie is able to completely baffel me  but i felt out and out lied to  they whole time they lead you in one direction and then suddenly they decided to go in a completely different direction at the end  they gave no hit to it at all  thats not misleading that very bad writing and planning  someone did not think at all   br    br   i felt the movie would have been much better if they had stuck to the plot that the lead you on  they also seemed to not answer anything  why did jane  maria  burn down the professor  s house .  br    br   its a great pity as i felt it started out as a relatively good movie .  ,0
the special effects of this movie are  especially for its time  laughable and used in such an over  emphasized way that you can  t deny their terrible existance .  br    br   the acting redefines the term  terrible overacting  at the hands of meg foster and richard joseph paul  where julie newman and andrew divoff just redefine  bad  .  br    br   spoilers  br    br   the charm in this movie can be found in two things first is the excellent casting of carel  lurch  struycken as the mysterious psychic gaunt  who can sense where and when people will die and is always there .  br    br   the second are original finds  the combination sf  western is obviously original  if terrible  but other finds are more original  like the gunman zack stone being able to sense the pain of the people he shoots  though his acting falls short here  .  br    br   overal . . . don  t see this movie  except if you love that ol  hunk  o  brutal carel struycken  as any self  respecting dutchman should .  ,0
julia roberts obviously makes a concerted effort to shake off her cotton wool pretty woman persona with this spurious spousal abuse thriller  but it  s hard to imagine she  d end up putting in a performance as powerful and convincing  and oscar winning  as she did in erin brokovich based on the back of this rubbish . and make no bones about it  it  s nothing more than a julia roberts vehicle  but unfortunately  her performance is not the most lacklustre thing about it .  br    br   the plot has all the markings of a late night made  for  cable  and don  t be under the impression that it will offer any insight into the dark world of domestic abuse because non of the characters are sketched out enough for you to really care .  br    br   ultimately disappointing and unsatisfying  without roberts  name above the title  i  m sure it would have totally flopped  deservedly .  ,0
when i saw this movie i heard all the hype  and i heard how people said that denzel deserved the oscar alongside his golden globe and i believed he must have done an outstanding job considering kevin spacey was excellent . i was wrong . i realize that people say this not to anger the african american community  if they are not african americans themselves  . i always hear complaints on how african americans are never nominated and how they should have won . sometimes this is true  not as much nowadays  because whoppi goldberg should have won best actress for the color purple and the movie should have won best picture . the only reason this movie was so blown up the way it was  is because people see a movie about the  semi  spoiler  hardships of an african american during a very racist time period and they automatically label it as a masterpiece .  br    br   denzel washington is an outstanding actor  but his role in this movie did not affect me whatsoever . i was bored with him in the movie  and his acting here was quite similar to his role in malcolm x but not as good . the audience is supposed to leave believing this man  rubin carter  is a saint . people left the movies worshipping this man  this hero  and they went out and bought his book  making this hero of a man rich .  br    br   spoilers this movie tells the tale of a man who spent the majority of his life in prison mainly for crimes he did not commit . of course the crimes he did commit  stealing mostly  was only to survive  nothing more . people felt sorry for him  even though the drug dealers and thieves probably amounted to as much for the same reasons but are looked down upon in society . everything in this movie tries to portray this man as a saint  except for the obvious infidelity he had towards his wife and the aggression he showed the other man when he met his wife  but why wouldn  t it  after all  it is his point of view . i do not like movies  especially hollywood interpretations  that are based on  true  stories because they usually distort the  true  parts into something else  something not so true . this was his point of view and a hollywood construction  yet everyone believed it was the truth unquestionably . well i researched his past a bit before making any assumptions  and he was a very violent man . not only that  there is still a possibility that he did murder those people . if you do not believe me  search for him on the internet  and read the articles some people have of him . the boxing match he claimed to have won so easily  was actually won by his opponent joey giardello and there are tapes to prove it . besides that  there are many twisted and purposely left out facts in this movie . the supporting cast were the nicest people i have ever seen on the face of the earth and their  nice and perfect  persona looked difficult to keep up .  br    br   this movie was a hollywood version of yet another unfortunate true story that is still left to be told truthfully . denzel  s acting is stale  and the supporting cast  s mickey mouse attitudes are annoying . the movie also begins very slow paced and is boring .  ,0
this movie is hilarious  not in good way . the fights are awfully bad done  while sometimes they will try to shock you by breaking some bones  and even this happens only two or three times  definitely not enough to call it a shockmovie . a gunfight means a hero can walk into an open field with   people shooting at him with uzi  s  pick up a gun  start shooting back and not get hurt .  br    br   the story empty  guy waking up  lost his memory  starts fighting cos that  s what he  s good at . five years later memories come back  takes revenge blablabla .  br    br   not worth your buck  not really worth your time unless you  re drunk and bored .  ,0
there  s a great deal of material from the modesty blaise comics and novels that would be great in a movie . unfortunately  several attempts have been made and they  ve fallen short of the great potential in the character . so  no  this isn  t the modesty you know from the comic strip  currently reprinted in nice editions from titan books  . this is modesty some  or  years prior to the first strip  and from what you can piece together from her back  story  it  s accurate .  br    br   miramax had the movie rights to the character  with quentin tarantino acting as advocate and technical adviser . early drafts of the miramax project attempted to adapt one of the best novels  but always managed to leave out some crucial element . tarantino wasn  t happy with any of them  and offered to remove his name from the project so they could proceed . to the studio  s credit  they wanted to keep him in the process  since they knew he  got  the character and her world . with the movie rights close to expiration  they decided to try a very different approach . the result was  my name is modesty   a small direct  to  video movie that introduces the character .  br    br   the movie does not introduce willie garvin or sir gerald . these characters are important to blaise  s adventures throughout most of the published stories . what this movie accomplishes is showing the strength of the character by herself . she never loses her composure  and you never doubt that she  s in charge even unarmed in a room full of gangsters with guns . most of the movie takes place within a casino  which undoubtedly saved money on the production . it doesn  t matter . the film does not come across as cheap . instead  it gives a fairly comprehensive  and believable  back  story for the character and demonstrates just how far she thinks ahead . should miramax adapt any of the comic stories or novels now  they  ve laid out the character  s background nicely and won  t have to spend much time on her  origin .  i realize the words  direct  to  video  don  t inspire confidence  but this film is well worth a look .  ,1
undoubtedly the best heavy metal horror item made in the manically headbangin     s  which admittedly doesn  t sound like much considering how utterly abysmal many other entries in this odd little fright film sub  genre like  hard rock zombies    blood tracks    terror on tour   and the especially ungodly jon  mikl thor  starring stinker  rock  n  roll nightmare  tended to be . that aside  this one still deserves props for downplaying the excessive splatter and needlessly flashy special f  x razzle  dazzle in favor of focusing on adolescent high school characters who are depicted with greater acuity and plausibility than the norm for a mid     s teen  targeted scarefest . moreover  the film  s pointed sardonic parodying of both ridiculously overblown    s heavy metal stupidity and the nauseating self  righteousness of the uptight killjoy conservative stiffs who claimed it was the devil  s music are very clever and on the money funny  famed greed decade heavy metal god ozzy osbourne has a hilarious bit as a smarmy anti  metal tv evangelist   .  br    br   marc price  the hopelessly dweeby skippy on  family ties   gives a surprisingly strong and winning performance as eddie  ragman  weinbauer  a geeky  socially awkward and severely persecuted heavy metal aficionado who  s constantly picked on by the stuck  up jerk preppie bullies who make up the majority of the student body at lakeridge high school  the cruelty and mean  spiritedness of the high school kids is nailed with painfully credible accuracy  . eddie  s life takes a turn for the worse when his rock star idol sammi curr  an impressively whacked  out portrayal by tony fields  perishes in a hotel fire . hip local disc jockey nuke  kiss front  man gene simmons in a cool cameo  hooks eddie up with sammi  s final  unreleased album  which when played backwards resurrects curr  s malevolent spirit back from the dead . sammi encourages eddie to sic him on all the vile scumbags who make poor eddie  s life the proverbial living hell  only to have meek eddie prove to be a most reluctant would  be accomplice . it  s up to eddie  assisted by token nice girl leslie graham  likeably essayed by the lovely lisa orgolini   to stop sammi before things get too out of hand .  br    br   ably directed with commendable thoughtfulness and sensitivity by character actor charles martin smith  who also briefly appears as a nerdy school teacher   smartly written by michael s . murphy  joel soisson  and rhet topham  and capably acted by a uniformly up  to  snuff cast  this surefire sleeper even comes complete with a handful of nifty  jump  moments  an outrageous attack in the back of a car by a grotesquely lecherous long  tongued mutant thingie rates as the definite highlight   a rousing  carrie   style high school dance slaughter sequence  a neatly utilized halloween setting  revenge being correctly shown as a truly ugly business  and a solid central message that you shouldn  t make a particular over  hyped person your hero strictly because of the calculated anti  establishment posturing said fellow does to qualify for that special status .  ,1
this project was originally conceived as the movie version of popular japanese manga slamdunk  and that  s not something new to jay chou  who made his movie debut playing a character from another wildly popular manga initial d . along the way  it was decided to incorporate some kung fu into the movie  so hence the title  even if the idea wasn  t very original  with stephen chow  s shaolin soccer coming to mind with martial arts and ball games combined .  br    br   however  and thankfully  those scenes where kung fu actually influenced the games were kept to a bare minimum  and in kung fu dunk  really quite unnecessary  because they don  t add much to the plot nor drum up much excitement  and at most offered some cheap laughs and reminisced about the time when stephen chow used kung fu in football games . jay chou is comfortable in his role as a martial artist fang shi  jie since it  s not the first time he fought using martial arts  curse of the golden flower anyone    and under the stunt direction of ching siu  tung  he was made to look really believable as he trashes countless of gangsters in a bar as seen in the trailer  just to let you know who  s boss .  br    br   that was almost why his character is made a kung fu practitioner  and for the fact of giving him an excuse for being a top shot  able to shoot the hoops from practically any angle . and with eric tsang as a small time hustler chen  li who sees his potential and becomes his agent  he joins a university to play varsity basketball  but not without the initial objection of team captain ting  wei  chen bo  lin  and team star xiao  lan  baron chen  in his big  screen debut  . but you know with team members on the same side  it  s not before long they combine their strengths to take on adversaries on the basketball court .  br    br   and i will stick my neck out to say that this movie is to basketball just as how goal was to football . it made the sport look good because of its charismatic characters  despite them dripping so much coolness and aloofness on the courts . here  special effects and wire  work were employed to make the actors seem like professionals who can take out a top side in the nba league  and in all honesty  really looked stunning  especially when they mimic various dunking moves  and performing combo  moves thanks to technology and stunt work . so in actuality  the kung fu elements don  t really have to be in the movie . the stunt work itself will be able to justify most of the moves as they  re quite grounded to reality  only having you to suspend belief that boys of average height have springs in their feet to leap that height for a professional dunk .  br    br   pity too that the number of games were only a handful  with the time spent on plenty of subplots  but each were loosely developed and flitted in and out of the story as and when they please . things like the abandoned shi  jie  s quest to use the basketball games to get his parents to one day attend them  that of gangsterism penetrating and influencing games  and his love life with charlene choi in yet another flower vase role just to look good and do nothing else . everyone  s acting a little too cool  leaving little room for main characters to add depth . one of the key themes here is the realization of the importance of teamwork rather than on individual talent and ability  and it could have been brought out much stronger if the players themselves interacted a lot more off the court  than only on it  and during competitive games  apart from the high  fives and friendly passes .  br    br   with the us   million budget  it is easy to see where the money went to  the effects  in particular  a massive fantasy sequence at a crucial point in the movie . it  s quite flawless  nice to look at and probably justifiable on its quality alone  but again i like to emphasize  that even without those elements  the basketball stunts itself would still make this a decent movie with nifty basketball moves . and having jay chou playing for your team is a big boost to any hopes of a box office success .  ,1
what an absolutely stunning movie  if you have  .  hrs to kill  watch it  you won  t regret it  it  s too much fun  rajnikanth carries the movie on his shoulders and although there isn  t anything more other than him  i still liked it . the music by a . r . rehman takes time to grow on you but after you heard it a few times  you really start liking it .  ,1
everyone is surely familiar with this most famous of stories  a heartless businessman is visited by the ghost of his dead partner on christmas eve and warned that if he continues in his uncaring ways then he will be doomed to an afterlife in chains . so that he can avoid his partner  s fate he is visited by three spirits who show him visions of christmases past  present and yet to come  so that he will hopefully see the error of his ways before it is too late . a rather morbid tale one might think  but it is classic charles dickens  and also one of the most famous and popular christmas stories of all time .  br    br   to me this is the definitive version of dickens  timeless story it  s the one i always remember watching in school  and i remember being absolutely terrified by it  the ghost of jacob marley  the final scene with the ghost of christmas present under the bridge  and the ghost of christmas yet  to  come especially i found very frightening . how on earth did the film gain the  u  certificate   for non  uk readers  u  is the lowest classification  it means family friendly and children welcome  nothing to scare them etc . . . this is certainly not the case though  as some smaller children will undoubtedly find the final segment positively terrifying with the grim reaper  like spectre of christmas future .  br    br   be that as it may  from the many versions of this classic story i have seen adapted for film  this is possibly the most faithful to the book . most notably included is a segment rarely seen in film adaptations of the original text  that of the ghost of christmas present showing scrooge the two children hidden under his robe  you  d never get away with a scene like that nowadays   . the two children represent ignorance and need  although changed to want in this film  .  br    br   criticisms for me however become apparent having watched it again with more objective and trained eyes  the main one of which being that george c . scott  s portrayal of scrooge seems simply not cold enough . he laughs too much . i don  t want to use the word jolly because of course ebeneezer is anything but  but he does seem to be merely a grumpy old man  rather than the positively unkind  cold and uncaring man that he is in the book and other films . patrick stewart portrayed him excellently in one of the most recent versions filmed  and michael caine  despite acting alongside the muppets  was positively cold . further  the development of the character over the course of the film as he learns more about the error of his ways and grows towards redemption is unconvincing and appears inconsistent . he appears to have changed little by the time he reaches the third spirit  s final lesson .  br    br   but ignoring this one  albeit major  quibble  it is still a spellbinding and ultimately heart  warming christmas tale  as all christmas films should be . london of course looks like the perfect picturesque quaint snow  covered english town that many americans probably imagine it still is  the truth is that even then that london was grey and grimy  and any snow would never have been so white   and everyone is so impeccably dressed too  even the poor people look rather dapper . but of course it  s a christmas film  so why shouldn  t everything look nice  perfect holiday season viewing coupled with copies of it  s a wonderful life  miracle on   th street and the snowman and you  ve got everything you need .  ,1
another in a long line of flicks made by people who think that knowing how to operate a camera is the same as telling a story . within   minutes  the entire premise is laid out in just a few lines  so there is absolutely no mystery  which eliminates a whole facet of the suspense . the only half  way competent actor is killed   minutes into the film  so we  re left with stupid characters running around doing stupid things . low budget films can  t afford expensive special effects  so the cgi portions are unsurprisingly unimpressive  but were at least a valid attempt . the creature suit is terrible  as seen when it falls to the sidewalk  and the director keeps emphasizing the eyes  which aren  t even the red color shown in mirror shots . the dialogue is clumsy and uninspired  with some lines reminiscent of aliens or terminator . the last action sequence takes place in a police station  also a rip  off from terminator  with everyone hiding in the one glass lined office that the darkwolf doesn  t smash into . in the end  the girl calls the hero  a good protector   but he gets both his partners  the original protector  and at least three other civilians  not to mention a dozen cops  all killed without getting a decent shot off  in spite of an arsenal of silver bullets and a submachine gun . but here  s the real clincher for bad writing they could have killed the beast right after the beginning credits when it was holding the stripper while flashing its red eyes . instead  they took it into custody     ,0
i think this is almost all i need to say . i feel obliged to explain my actions though . i  ve basically never seen such an armature production  and i mean that in all senses of the word . although he physical camera work  boom mic operation and other technical aspects of this film are laughable  unfortunately its not the only areas .  br    br   unlike some classic independent films that have been saved by their scripts great characterization and plot  this unfortunately has an awful script  awful acting and worst of all  awful annoying characters .  br    br   it  s a crime that for the every independent film that gets  distribution like haiku tunnel  there  s a    other indie films that died silent deaths . i don  t know who the kornbluth brothers know at sony  but that can be my only explanation as to how this amateur family production ever got distribution . i  m quite bemused as to why they picked this up .  br    br   the only part of this film that holds out any intrigue is its title . however  the reason for that is even a let down . i hope this review will save a few people that may be intrigued by this films title from going to watch it . i  ve seen a lot of films in my time  and i  m very forgiving when in the cinema  but this was too much . i  ll never forget  tunnel   for marking an important point in my life experience of cinema . shame it  s such a low point .  ,0
great mystery  but the film goes down hill from there . the beginning is promising with a car wreck and a woman and her daughter being burned alive in front of a police officer  edward . he is traumatized over this and is seen popping pills . a mysterious letter turns up from an old girlfriend asking for help in finding her missing daughter . so ed travels to an island commune of mainly woman . they don  t like outsiders . a lot of filler is with ed shown looking around town for the girl . that made the movie too long . it finally gets a little better toward the end when we learn of the crazy rituals the woman perform and finally of the sinister plan in store for edward .  br    br   overall  not a well written story and too long .  br    br   final verdict i would skip this .  ,0
this film describes the experiences of a couple of hit men  one of them burt reynolds   a prostitute  and two drag queens over the interval of a few hours on one night in miami . the convergent storylines eventually bring all the people together at one place and time . the movie was mildly entertaining  but the big problem was that everything happens at night and many scenes were literally under  exposed to the point that it was impossible to see what was happening . in a few scenes you can actually see where they tried to  stretch  the developing process to save the images . somebody didn  t know how to operate a movie camera . amazing that this film was even released   ,0
things to come is an historic film . along with metropolis        it stands as one of the first great science fiction spectacles . it is also one of the first doomsday movies . it is remarkable how the filmmakers predict the start of the second world war within a year  and even  in a subtle way  the year it would end in the real world . but then the film departs from reality  depicting a world ravaged by war  only substitute poison gas for nuclear weapons which of course did not exist in      .  br    br   the last half hour of the film is an incredible sight  making groundbreaking use of models and matte paintings   later to become staples of the science fiction genre . it is sad that  after things to come  sci  fi would become identified with cheaply made b  movies  a stereotype that wouldn  t be broken until     a space odyssey more than   years later . if they  d stuck with the quality of the effects in this film  things would have been very different in hollywood .  br    br   raymond massey and some of his co  stars play multiple roles in this film  to good effect . massey plays a great  doctor who   like role as a pilot from an advanced  for      civilization who tries to win over the populace of a devastated country ruled by a simple  minded warlord  a very effective performance by ralph richardson  . ultimately  the storyline covers    years . but that  s a big problem with this film   there really isn  t a cohesive storyline .  br    br   perhaps in such an episodic film   somewhat reminiscent of intolerance  actually   it  s hard to have a conventional plot  but i felt more could have been made of the material  and although the visuals in the final third of the picture are indeed stunning and worth the price of admission . . . the plot is nonexistent and the movie itself suddenly ends just as it is getting interesting . maybe the producers were thinking of another future sci  fi innovation a sequel   br    br   things to come is a film every serious sci  fi buff should see at least once . unlike metropolis  however  it might not bear repeated viewings .  ,1
i think the movie was pretty good  will add it to my  clasic collection  after all this time . i believe i saw other posters who reminded some of the pickier people that it is still just a movie . maybe some of the more esoteric points defy  logic   but a great many religious matters accepted  on faith  fail to pass the smell test . if you  re going to accept whatever faith you subscribe to you can certainly accept a movie . is it just me or has anyone else noticed the aja  yee dagger is the same possessed knife lamonte cranston had so much trouble gaining control of in  the shadow  . no mention of it in the trivia section for either movie here  imdb   but i would bet a dollar to a donut it  s the same prop .  ,1

this     made for tv movie was shown on a women  s channel  naturally . as a man  why do i even attempt to watch this  i don  t know  but i should have my head examined . and director and writer simon gornick should be ashamed of himself to give men an injustice as he does . he takes away any strength and conviction a man could have by having several boring women do him in . number one bore is joyce hyser as the wife . i couldn  t wait for him to drop her . her revenge was silly and stupid and very confusing through most of the movie . the other femme fatale was nichole hiltz  about the coldest person you  d ever want to meet . her looks didn  t warrant our leading man to go that ape over her and her acting was so obvious  only a fool could miss . definitely a loser . tembi locke was pretty good  but slow on the uptake as to the slut seducing her own husband  again played as a guy who is a loser  by david deluise . rounding out our cast of losers is anthony denison as a boss who has little to do but scowl at our hero . stephen jenkins as our hero  or should i say victim  was not that good . at first i thought he just a bad actor  but later i believed it . he never got the part off the ground and was repetitive throughout . although  as a man  i became enraged when the two women got away with it . men  beware of this channel that puts men down and women get away even with murder . lmn is the channel . beware . note having watched this a second time by mistake  i am convinced on my initial thoughts . especially on the writer  director  simon gornick . i still believe he has disgraced the male species and should be horse whipped . only saving grace in this film is tembi locke who doesn  t have a chance to show her talents with the awful acting of jenkins  hyser  hiltz and deluise around her . plus the stupid plot that only makes it worse . down with gornick  s movie and his vacant stars in it . please lmn don  t show this trite again .  ,0

  home room  like  zero day  and  elephant   was inspired by the recent wave of school shootings . but unlike the other two films   home room  focuses on two survivors  not the shooters or those killed  in the aftermath of a shooting . making it less exploitive and more useful because little effort is wasted in asking questions for which there are no answers .  br    br   don  t give up on this little film during the first   minutes  it is supposed to set up the real story but plays like a rejected  hill street blues  episode . it is lame but bear with it  at least it pads the running length enough to get the film classified as a feature . i recommend skipping this entirely and just jumping ahead to the hospital scenes  there is nothing here that you can  t pick up from the remainder of the film .  br    br   like a lot of good little films this was creatively a one  man show as paul f . ryan was both the writer and the director . while this arrangement does not guarantee a good film  it is usually a good sign because it will mean a certain unity of construction and execution that is often lacking in big budget dramatic features . because the script of  home room  is its real strength it is fortunate that the writer also executed the production and insured that his vision made it onto the screen .  br    br   ryan takes a huge chance with the ending which tests the limits of the average viewer  s sentimentality tolerance . he runs it right up to the edge but against all logic leaves you crying instead of cringing . why the ending works is some combination of the audience need for a reward at the end of this kind of journey  the song  sarah mclaughlin  s  sweet surrender   he goes out on  and the amazing editing of the final minute .  br    br   the other strength of the film is the casting of busy phillips  alicia  and erika christensen  deanna  as the main protagonists . although phillips plays her standard alienated surly teen and christensen her intelligent daughter of a good family  they both bring more intensity to their roles than ever before . the family life of both girls is more than satisfactory and of little interest to ryan . what is happening here is all about the two of them despite a lame side story about a police detective wondering around town trying to tie alicia to the lone shooter . if they ever re  cut and trim the film this side story should be condensed .  br    br   a story about two extremely disparate girls bonding and helping each other is hardly a novel idea and ryan could have easily steered this film into clich and predictability . but instead his script has them engaging in a fascinating and convincing sparring match  slowly chipping away at each other and sharing moments of vulnerability  only to retreat back inside themselves . deanna  s  i  m dying inside  line just tears you apart  i can  t think of a moment in any other film that i felt as intensely as that one . she desperately needs a connection that alicia just as desperately resists . deanna only makes progress when she retreats . the viewer keeps expecting the group hug that never seems to happen .  br    br   ultimately this not only generates a lot of suspense but leaves you admiring both characters and the two actresses who brought them to life .  br    br   then again  what do i know  i  m only a child .  ,1
this wasn  t all that great . not terrible or hateful or anything  just forgettable .  br    br   it had a sort of  um  hesitant  diluted air  like it never properly knew whether it wanted to go for laughs or for sweetness or for satire . so we were left with weak mix of the three . the actors seemed kinda lost .  br    br   also  the ideas were really tired and recycled  almost zombified themselves . how many more times do we have to be told the    s in the states were infected with a banal sense of conformity  and that this was perpetuated by aggressive consumerism  and that emotional repression in men is a baaaaad thing  old hat .  br    br   its biggest crime in my eyes though was just how detached from reality it was . i know it was a comedy and all  but  especially in a full movie where you must keep the interest of an audience for a prolonged period  you still need some sort of emotional anchor  some relatable guide through the story  to make it engaging . for the  hero  kid to watch an old woman  two fellow school pupils and ultimately his father die painfully at the hands of zombies or whatever and for him to greet it all with a cheery smile and a shrug of the shoulders  then i just struggle to deal with that in any sort of positive way . the mum was the same . if you make your two main characters so inhuman on that level  then you risk losing me and that  s what happened .  br    br   biggest positive i can offer is that i love the look of that sort of apple pie suburbia and this captured it well enough  it was a handsome film  especially some of those wide angled shots of the street and inside the robinsons  house . also  the opening newsreel was cute  in a been  done  before  but  still  funny sort of way .  br    br   and i thought billy connolly was ok and that comes from someone who isn  t a big fan of billy connolly movie star . i just had this fear he was going to be hamming it up and trying to steal every scene  but he played it pretty low  key for him and probably came out the most sympathetic character in the whole film .  br    br   all in all  not great though .  ,0
if you  re a fan of gothic horror  then you  re definitely absolutely guaranteed to love this wondrous italian    s film  castle of blood  . we  re really talking about creepily creaking doors  eerie portraits that appear to be moving  spontaneously dying candles although there  s no wind and smoke coming from underneath heavy wooden chamber doors . speaking in terms of atmosphere and style  this masterful piece of gothic film  making is one of the best out there just one tiny league below landmarks such as  black sunday    the three faces of fear  and  curse of the crying woman  . the prominent directors duo sergio corbucci   the great silence    django   and antonio margheriti   cannibal apocalypse    killer fish   are successful in all areas  including a powerful plot  one that is genuinely nightmare inducing   ultra  sinister scenery and filming locations  stylish black and white photography  spine  chilling music and a brilliant gathering of talented performers . barbara steele  starlet of the aforementioned  black sunday  and italian goth  muse number one  shines brightly again as a spiritually tormented character and she  s literally surrounded by excellent co  players . one of them  silvano tranquilli  even gives away a fairly credential depiction of author edgar allan poe . the story involves him and another wealthy visitor of a countryside tavern challenging a brutal young journalist to accept a morbid wager . if he  alan foster  would survive spending one night in the infamous blackwood castle  he receives the astonishing reward of    and a newspaper interview with poe . needless to say the ordeal is much more dangerous than it sounds  even for somebody like alan foster who  s a firm non  believer in ghosts and vampires . the night starts out great for him  as he even meets up with the stunningly beautiful woman of his dreams  but gradually he learns that blackwood castle is a hellish place where the ghosts of the previously deceased visitors are trapped for all eternity . i don  t know about you  but this is seriously one of my favorite horror movie premises of all time . co  director antonio margheriti clearly was proud of this film as well  because he remade it himself a couple of years later as  web of the spider  . that movie had a handful of trumps  like for example the casting of no less than klaus kinski in the role of edgar allan poe  but in general this original is vastly superior .  castle of blood  literally oozes with atmosphere and maintains a thoroughly unsettling ambiance throughout . this truly is one of the rare films that can make the hair on your arms and back of the neck rise with fear if you watch it in the right circumstances . watch it late at night  preferably alone and in a candle lit room  and you  ll get an idea about the true definition of horror .  ,1

this picture was banned from american movies houses in the     because of nudity by hedy lamarr   eva hermann  which caused all kinds of problems among the ladies in the      s but not so much for the male population . this story concerns a young woman named eva hermann who gets married to an older man and is carried over the threshold on the wedding night and the husband never consummates the marriage and worries about all kinds of very petty things like his shoes and killing bugs . eva leaves her husband  s house and lives with her father and tries to explain her situation . on a hot summer day eva takes a ride on her horse and decides to go for a swim naked in a lake in the woods . her horse runs off and she runs after him and is observed by a young man who finds her clothes and returns them to eva . these two people become very acquainted and there is a romance that starts to bloom . there are many more interesting problems that arise as you view this film to its very end . enjoy a great classic film which was a shocker film in     . enjoy .  ,1
this movie had no parts that were hilarious  mostly just average funny units  but it did not have any parts that were really bad either . the worst part was the voice of sid . his slothy slur was just too much for me . by about  minutes in i was sick of hearing him talk . aside from the annoying sloth voice the movie was good . there were numerous side jokes which if you catch them make the movie much better . this is a good movie for kids . it has enough in it to keep adults content and enough in it to entertain kids . this one is definitely worth renting if you have kids and want to watch a movie with them .  ,1

although the flock has some pretty good acting by veteran richard gere  and some okay shots that might harken some back to the silence of the lambs days  the movie stretches credibility to the breaking point and destroys itself against a plot that really leads nowhere .  br    br   the film is about erroll babbage  gere  who works for the department of safety and is preparing to retire . his office thrusts upon him his replacement  allison lowry  claire danes  stardust   who quickly discovers that babbage is obsessed with his job . and that job ain  t very fun . he monitors hundreds of sexual offenders who are on parole in his jurisdiction . allison goes with erroll on many calls to check up on his  flock  of offenders and learns that he is in desperate need of retirement . but erroll is good at his job even if his methods aren  t . he taunts sexual predators and even has physical conflicts with them . erroll justifies his actions by bringing up these deviants  pasts . it is this  good justification  that challenges the audience on some level  letting us see how brutal erroll is and yet how out  of  touch he  s become  by being too close to his job  .  br    br   when a teenage girl goes missing in erroll  s  area   he immediate leaps to the conclusion that she was abducted by one of his flock . but how could he know  is erroll that good at his job  allison challenges him and erroll pushes back . their battles become as fierce as erroll  s need to find this missing girl .  br    br   although the set  up for the story was okay  it didn  t have any umpf  i will give credit to richard gere  however  who plays the erroll character very well . battling retirement . worried about everyone who  s near his flock . disgusted with those he  s responsible for overseeing . disgusted with himself for having to do some of things he does . quite a change in character portrayal for gere . but beyond him there  s not much else . some of the sets are okay  dark and dangerous  but there are so many other problems as to be laughable .  br    br   i  ll be the first to admit that suspending disbelief is a requirement whenever watching films . but that suspension has limits . the biggest push against those limits is the destruction of extremely vital crime scenes . someone as meticulous as erroll would know that moving a body would be a huge no  no . or trampling through a crime scene . or moving evidence . it went beyond and hurt the film to no end .  br    br   the other damaging part of this film is that we never get into clair danes  character  allison . she  s almost dropped by the wayside at the end of the film and we  re never privy to what her intension might be will she stay or leave  will she end up like erroll if she does stay  this isn  t a horrible film as it does touch on some uncomfortable moral ground  but the story as a whole needed to be tightened up .  ,0

this is a classic british comedy  thriller i had always wanted to check out but no opportunity had arisen for that until now . it  s based on a popular stage play which had already been filmed a number of times previously  most notably in     by the same director but  unfortunately  this version seems not to have survived in its entirety    for the remake under review  the plot has been updated to the then  current wartime situation .  br    br   anyway  i was mainly familiar with early british comedians through the films of will hay given that this one features a similar plot of legendary hauntings  smuggling and enemy agents  it  s very much in that vein  it was actually scripted by hay  s regular writing team of marriott edgar  val guest and j . o . c . orton   the stranded travelers element  then  was an equally tried  and  true formula . the star this time around is arthur askey  abetted by richard murdoch   none of whose films i had watched before  who is as unlikely a hero as hay himself and whose personality proves to be just as potentially irritating . . . but one soon warms up to him  and askey certainly comes up with a number of witty lines and amusing bits of business throughout to justify the fact that the lead character of the play  and the     film version  was split into two here  with murdoch acting as the star  s straight partner .  br    br   the remote single setting  the events of the film largely take place during one stormy night  provides for some wonderful atmosphere the last half  hour  with the sudden appearance of a mysterious couple  raymond huntley and linden travers  and eventually the arrival of the titular vehicle itself  is especially gripping and well handled . also worth mentioning from the remaining cast list is kathleen harrison as the stereotypical frightened spinster  with a parrot as her constant companion and who is driven by all the excitement to take her very first drink .  ,1
the peculiar charisma of martin kosleck brings a certain believability to his character of the frustrated artist . he imbues his dialog with an odd sense of realism  making the sculptor marcel a convincing individual . the character manages to come across as a real person and not so much a typical b movie villain .  br    br   the story line is nothing to write home about  and many scenes are dull . what makes it work is the strange chemistry between kosleck and rondo hatton as the creeper . kosleck  s talkative  philosophical character is contrasted with hatton  s low key  monosyllabic approach . the character of the creeper isn  t developed much beyond a basic monster level  but hatton suggests undeveloped possibilities and makes you wonder about his back story .  br    br   this movie was on shock theater a lot when i was a kid  so i have a certain nostalgic fondness for it . it  s worth seeing once  anyway  for those who enjoy forties horror movies .  ,0
perhaps it  s me and my perverted ways  or the fact that i tend to have a very sick mind  but i rented this film at random one very weird night and to my great surprise  i enjoyed it .  br    br   yes  i read the synopsis on the back of the dvd box and read that it had been banned for   years and figured i was prepared for anything it would offer . i was clearly deceived after seeing . . . well . . . everything  to cut a long story short . i can see why it was banned  not only for such explicit sex scenes  but for beastiality .  br    br   of course  as it is freely based on the classic fairy tale of beauty and the beast  a personal favorite of mine  it tells the story of a girl  s sexual awakening over a dream about a duchess being chased by a whatever  the  hell  that  thing  was  like beast with an enormous erection and a substantial amount of ejaculation . of course  the beast gets what he wants and the duchess decides she likes it and they continue frolicking in the woods .  br    br   but that  s not all . oh  there is so much more   br    br   not only do we get to see interspecial sex  but there  s also humping horses  the babysitter who gets down and dirty with the slave when she  s not humping the bed to get her . . . er . . . satisfaction and the daydreaming girl masturbating with rose petals .  br    br   creative and enjoyable  but it did take a while for my father to talk to me again after he watched it after i went to bed . . . i was   . words of advice when watching this film make sure you  re the only one who knows you have it and watch it with the curtains closed . it may be fun  but i doubt there are other porn films like this one .  ,1
the plot of  edison  was decent  but one actor in particular ruined the entire film . justin timberlake ruined the film with every line he uttered during the movie . he is by far one of the worst actors i have ever seen  and should face the same fate as the entire f . r . a . t . squad .  br    br   whether it was an emotional scene  an action scene  or even a silent scene  justin timberlake managed to ruin it .  br    br   do not waste your time watching this film . don  t even bother downloading it  midget porn would be a much better choice .  br    br   and justin  if you  re reading this  stick to music . even though you  re no good at that  you  ve done a wonderful job tricking people into thinking you can actually sing .  ,0
  kolchak  was a tv series that really didn  t fit into any category . part horror  part comedy  some social awareness thrown in  and what we have is something that i think people weren  t ready for . it  s a shame really  as i  ve started to watch these shows on the chiller network   i never saw the originals   i realized how different and interesting it really was .  br    br   starring darren mcgavin as kolchak a reporter for the international news service  and simon oakland as his always angry boss  tony vincenzo  the show followed the exploits of a chicago news reporter who more often than not  became a part of the story himself  as he searched the windy city for modern day creepies that go bump in the night . the underlying charm of macgavin really sets the show apart . a somewhat goofy guy  who always wears the same suit  you cannot help but love him . his jokes are great  and the back and forth between him and the skeptical editor  oakland  are downright hilarious .  br    br   the stories are for the most part pretty good  and the acting is very good . the    s were not a great period for special effects  and the show suffers for it  but if you suspend disbelief  what you have is a fun series that was ahead of it  s time .  ,1
although it has been remade several times  this movie is a classic if you are seeing it for the first time . creative dialog  unique genius in the final scene  it deserves more credit than critics have given it . highly recommended  one of the best comedies of recent years  ,1
this was my first  and probably the last angelopoulos movie . i was eager to get into it  as it featured mastroianni  one of my favorite actors and was a film by theo  of whom i  ve heard a lot . the opening was promising  a long shot over a jeep of soldiers across the albanian  greek border . ok  but that was all . nothing left . the movie had big holes and i don  t know which to mention first . the main plot of the story is revealed to the journalist by the old woman . during a long walk . it  s like a   minutes monologue  killing the action and viewers patience  nothing happening on screen for   or even   minutes  apart this old lady telling a story . all that is presumed to be shown through action  was simply told to the camera by the old lady . in a moment  the equippe of tv was heading to the bar . they turn the corner and immediately the winter begins  probably  shot in different days  continuity leaked . a lot of problems with the story  telling  it went from absurd to irrational never sticking to a style  making the viewer asking questions that never got answers . poor mastroianni  given a role which lacked integrity or charm . on the other hand  as many greeks or albanians or balcan people would agree with  the movies showed lot of historic  ethnic  or politically incorrectness  just for the sake of making a movie about  humanity  as a red in another review . a lot more to say  but no time to lose on a poor movie  which was not movie at all  but lunacies of a person impressed on film and paid with state money .  ,0
  nothin  . there ain  t nothing  in room    . but you ain  t got no business going  in there anyway . so stay out . you understand  stay out .   br    br   never has there been such a feat of psychological horror as this film achieves . this is the highest rated horror film of all and rightly so . jack nicholson is a superb actor and this is one of the greatest performances in cinema .  br    br   its about a family moving to an isolated and deserted hotel for  months over the winter . then the father  jack  becomes almost possessed by the horrors in the hotel .  br    br   kubricks direction is nothing short then perfect . the tense tracking shots  agonising music  mystical messages and perplexing plot makes this the best horror film ever made .  br    br   throughout the film there is constant references to danger  death and horror . red is used in every scene . is the red purposely put in by kubrick  of course  .  br    br   this is a definitive kubrick classic and this is the third of his films i have given      . he is a perfectionist in his direction and you can see it in all his films . he loves to perplex his watchers in everyone of his films .  br    br   i will be talking about this film for months to come . it has infinite depth .  br    br   in conclusion  this is the cornerstone of horror and tension . a masterpiece of terror       ,1
one of my favorite movies to date starts as an adventure through the wild side of a team of four men from atlanta . the idea of living the chulawasse river before it  s turned into a lake comes from burt reynold  s lewis  who unconsciously drowns his fellas into their worst nightmare . but if the first half of the film appears rather like an action movie  the second half carries the viewer into a totally different story  with our men forced to make a decision that  they know  will change their lives forever . in very bad ways . at the end of the movie  each person is gonna be forced to deal with the scars of what had just to be a quite week  end on the river but muted into a fight for survival . the movie  except some pretty evident goofs  is very well directed and beautifully shot into a paradise of nature that steals your breath . the photography is excellent as well . voight  reynolds  cox and beatty are all excellent in showing how a single event can ruin in different ways four different lives only tied to the same mistake .  ,1
without reiterating what was said above about this movie  i would like to add that i was looking forward to watching this film . . . the cast  location and the work of the excellent director michael winterbottom etc . . . it had a vague shadow of  don  t look now  about the storyline from the beginning . a stay in different surroundings  italy again  to dim the heartbreak of loss . . . or perhaps that  s how i saw it  so consequently i sat there waiting for the story to unfold and put a spin on what we expect to happen to this family in a foreign european country . . . . and i sat there and sat there . . . . and guess what  nothing actually happens  and i mean nothing   you are not even given the chance to get into the characters as they are so  dimensional and vacuous . . you are led to believe from the pace of the movie that something was going to happen to turn the whole film on it  s head . . . the eldest daughters flirtation with the local vespa boys  had great scope to take the movie in another direction  the youngest daughters visions of her dead mother ended up being a fruitless and pointless exercise  the fathers attempts at being seduced by one of his female students felt ridiculous given his age . it felt as if the script had a last recall made where they decided at the last minute to eradicated any guts to the story and went for paring it down to a bare minimum to no effect . when the credits started to roll  unexpectedly  you can  t help but feel robbed of your time spent sat watching this pile of rubbish .  ,0
i loved it  fred macmurray is wonderful as skid johnson  a somewhat conceited  proud yet at the same time very vulnerable saxophone player who is in love with maggie  carole lombard   who  s always there for him . they meet in panama after maggie comes off a ship and end up in a bar with anthony quinn . tony gets punched in the nose after her insults maggie by thinking her a loose woman  all because she took off her hat in public . big brawl and maggie ends up stuck in panama . romance . carole and arthur are great together . maggie is always there for him whenever he needs her . she urges him to go to ny where  well watch the movie and find out  . they have these wonderful scenes together where she sings in his arms while he plays the saxophone . i definitely recommend it .  ,1
in my humble opinion  this version of the great bdwy musical has only two things going for it  tyne daly and the fact that there is now a filmed version with the original script .  ok vanessa williams is good to watch .  but to me that  s all there is . most of the cast seem to be walking through the show  chynna phillips has no idea who kim really is and no wonder people walk over harry mcafee when it  s played by george wendt who looks like he  d rather be back on a bar stool in boston . jason alexander is passable  but that wig has to go and i saw better dancing in bugsy malone . as i mentioned  it  s good to have a version of the stage script now  but i hope the young out there  who have never seen a musical  don  t judge them all by this .  ,0
this is such a fantastic movie  a western about a self  concerned man  jimmy stewart  going up to the klondike for gold . on the way  he gets hassled by a local sheriff in alaska  john mcintire  giving a wonderfully evil performance   whom he hassles back . mcintire threatens that he  ll be a dead man if he ever comes back through his town  which is  unfortunately  the only way back to the states . the main chunk of the story is about the peaceful klondike town of dawson being turned upside down by new residents from mcintire  s town . ruth roman  for instance  who has come with stewart and his two companions  jay c . flippen and walter brennen  who plays stewart  s best friend   builds a saloon  a hollywood front for a whorehouse  and tries to run the town  s restaurant and hang  out place out of business . she paves the way for mcintire and his goons to come up  too . in      jimmy stewart and director anthony mann made one of the peaks of the western genre  the naked spur . the far country is just the tiniest bit less  and it contains   .   of what made that film so special without  of course  feeling like a cheap copy . like the naked spur  the far country boasts beautiful  on  location cinematography . the landscape is gorgeous . stewart gives one of his best performances  nearly equal to his biggest success of      rear window  . i suppose it could be considered cliche  as he starts out a selfish loner and learns how that kind of existence plays out in the end . still  stewart plays it so damn well  he makes this character very human . and the supporting performances are universally fantastic . in addition to those i  ve mentioned  the adorable french actress corinne calvet is very good . and i ought to single out walter brennen  as well . he seems to have specialized in playing best friends . his relationship with stewart is very touching  since he is  at first  the only character who is able to bring out any humanity in the cynical man . the screenplay is very well written  and mann  s direction is impeccable . a masterpiece .      .  ,1
  kalifornia  is a great film that makes us look at ourselves . the film has a great cast  brad pitt  johnny suede  a river runs through it  and the legends of the fall  as early grayce  david duchovny  the x files  as brian kessler  michelle forbes  star trekthe next generation  homicidelife on the street  and escape from l . a .  as carrie loughlin  brian  s girlfriend  and juliette lewis  natural born killers  cape fear  and what  s eating gilbert grape  as adele corners  early  s girlfriend .  br    br   brian kessler is a writer who is a liberal  is getting ready to write a book about serial killers . brian and his girlfriend  carrie decide they want to move to california  so brian places an ad at the college for some who wants to go to california  to share expenses on the trip .  br    br   early grayce is an ex con and sociopath on parole  who recently lost his job at the mirror factory in town  is in debt  owes his landlord money . early  s parole officer stops to visit him and tells him about a job . early goes to the college and sees the ad  he later tells adele  his girlfriend about leaving to go to california . early and adele meet brian and carrie at the bus stop and leave town . brian and carrie do not know that he is a killer who just killed his landlord . for a little while brian and carrie thought of early and adele different but got to know them and become sort of friends  carrie and adele become real good friends .  br    br   their journey is a very learning one . though brain and carrie not knowing early is a killer till later on in the movie . the question brian asks in this film about the difference between killers and us is a very good question . early grayce is a sociopath who doesn  t see the error of his ways  goes down hill later on and pays the price .  br    br   this film is a great movie  i give it      stars and  thumbs up . i love the songs in the movie  especially at the end of the film  the song  look up to the sky  by the indians .  ,1
this is one of my favorite films of all time . i read the book and liked it  but this movie expands on everything the book made famous . the acting is fantastic  especially from jon voight  who plays mr . sir  a very evil character . this film has a certain way of storytelling that keeps you hooked throughout  until the end where everything is pulled together for a great ending . i also love the way this is directed  by flashing back and forth between the modern day and stanley  s ancestors  stories . the story was written by louis sachar  yes  but it seems that this story is made for film  and andrew davis does a great job directing it . i definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys good movies .  ,1
eddie murphy plays chandler jarrell  a man who devotes his time to finding lost children . when the beautiful kee nang charlotte lewis enters his life  she tells him he is the chosen one and he must find the golden child . sceptical and driven purely by lust and intrigue  jarrell gets involved without realising he  s about to embark on a fantastical journey  one that involves peril and worst of all  the demon sardo numspa .  br    br   is the golden child a product of its time   by that i mean  was eddie murphy and the golden child  s popularity exclusive to the late     s audiences  . for i can remember vividly how much this film entertained folk back in that decade  it  s box office was             making it the  th biggest earner of      but since the   s faded from memory it has become the in thing to deny eddie murphy pictures the comedy accolades that they actually once had . the golden child is not up with the more accepted   s murphy pictures like trading places and beverly hills cop  but upon revisiting the film recently i personally find that it contains murphy at his wisecracking  quipping and charming best   seriously  .  br    br   cashing in on a fantasy action formula that was reinvigorated and temp  lated by raiders of the lost ark in      the golden child hits all the required genre buttons . pretty girl  daring reluctant  hero with a quip in his armoury  dashing villain charles dance so english i could kiss him myself  wonderful colour  and a cute kid with mystical powers  the film only asks you to get involved in the fun  not to dissect and digress its worth as a cranial fantasy picture . yes the cgi demon looks creaky now  and yes the genre had far better pictures in the   s    s and beyond  but really if you agree with the disgraceful rating of  here on this site then you may just be taking this genre a little too serious  seriously .      ,1
this movie deserves more than a  . but i  m giving it a one because so many fricken fan boys have given it a   resulting in it getting a rating that  ll take it into the top    list . seriously it  s not that great its not that bad . its a stupid cult classic with so many fricken fan boys it  s ridiculous . these are the types who probably still laugh at chuck norris jokes and still say  i  m rick james b  tch  no matter how old or annoying it gets . i dread having to hear  i  m tired of mfn snakes on this mfn plane  months from now from idiots trying to be funny . its crappy plot crap acting etc . its okay to love a bad movie  but you still gotta admit its a bad movie .  br    br   wait for the marine starring john cena if you wanna see a real movie  ,0
claire denis  s chocolat is a beautiful but frustrating film . the film presents a very interesting look at the household of a european colonial family living in cameroon  giving the viewer an informative perspective on the lives of many characters and their interaction . however  the development of these characters is often maddeningly insufficient . for example  a central theme in the story is young france  s inability to form strong relationships with others . although this portrayal is executed flawlessly  notably in the way that denis frames the story with scenes from france  s return to her childhood home  the girl  s lack of intimacy with the film  s other characters makes it difficult for a viewer to invest much interest in her development  or lack thereof  as a protagonist . the general stagnation of the film  s character development makes it difficult to become engaged in the loosely organized plot . the film raises a great deal of tension between characters  particularly between aimee and the men in her life  but never fully addresses this social friction  leaving the viewer unsatisfied . the final few scenes are powerful but depressing . denis  s work is certainly interesting from an intellectual and historical standpoint  but if you are looking for a film with adventure or drama  chocolat is definitely not the best choice .  ,1
go immediately and rent this movie . it will be be on a bottom shelf in your local video store and will be covered in dust . no one will have touched it in years . it may even be a  .   special  it  s worth ten bucks  i swear  buy it  there aren  t very many films than can compare with this  the celluloid version of that goo that forms at the bottom of a trash can after a few years . yes  i gave it a     but it really deserves much lower .     scales were not designed with stuff like this in mind .  ,0
hint number one  read the title as  the time of the mad dog   or perhaps dogs . this is a pretty good ensemble piece  look at the cast and rent it  you know you  re curious already   and first  time director bishop gives them their chance  taking his time  letting the characters interact and chew the scenery as they wait  not enthusiastically  for the return of  the big boss  and whatever revenge ensues .  br    br   for some of us  the highlight is seeing christopher jones after his self  imposed exile from films he remains a commanding film presence . and yes  with christopher jones  larry bishop and richard pryor involved  this is the  wild in the streets  reunion party   ,1
  i  ll indicate in this review the point where spoilers begin .  my dissatisfaction is split    tone  deafness     lackluster writing .  br    br   the    i agree with the first commenter  s synopsis about the lack of diversity in the characters and scope of the stories . i was surprised how  this film  at best  woefully shortchanges the real nyc by presenting a collection of people and relationships so narrow as to come across as if it  s inhabited only by the cast of gossip girl  this is coming from someone who likes gossip girl  . a few minority characters are written into the stories  but they are included by obligation  while we can see the gears under the film so clearly  striving to  be diverse  but falling ever  so  short .  br    br   the    is why everything falls short . all characters  white plus a few token minorities  are one  dimensional  cardboard cutouts of people concepts . worse  their interactions with each other are scripted in such a way that for each vignette in the film the audience is treated to what i  d say is a  gag   we get a basic conceit  then some punchline intended to be a clever twist . but even if we suspended cynicism for a moment to say   okay  that was a surprise  . . . the stories are still not that interesting  because they  too  are shallow . when you fashion stories so that their existence hinges solely on the unexpectedness of the ending  you  re writing jokes .  br    br   spoilers below . . .  br    br   the movie primarily tries to tell romantic stories . that  s fine . but romance is amazing  deep  sometimes complex . these  romantic  stories each feature a girl and a boy who at some point share the same location and get to look at each other . words exchange  thoughts are projected through voice  over  but they too only manage to communicate to the audience merely that one person is attracted to another .  br    br   meaning  there is no seduction  in the broad sense   no tension  and neither confrontation nor communion between the wills of two different people trying to reconcile their existence to accommodate the other . the only story involving a superficial  seduction  is told just so the audience ends up being surprised that the guy  ethan hawke  gets outwitted by the girl he  s hitting on  who unexpectedly turns out to be a hooker . sure  his words when trying to pick her up are interesting to hear and we are amused as we  d be if we were next to them  but there is nothing of substance to this story outside of  a then b  . so it unfolds  if something like a postcard could  unfold   with all the other tales as well a then b   that  s it  the only point being that these happen to occur  on set  in manhattan . by the way  the only brooklyn we see is the coney island sketch the only queens is the flickering of a train ride taken by a character traveling to the west village .  br    br   it  s easy to pick at movies that play into all the common stereotypes of race  gender  sexual orientation  and so on .  new york  i love you   however  deserves to be held to stricter scrutiny because of its title . we expect to see the real new york  and real new yorkers  but instead we have paraded before us the selected slice of a demographic  its characters flown in from the o . c .  plus a few others to make it seem as if we are paying attention to diversity . but when we look closer at who those characters are  the whole sham becomes an affront to the very notion of diversity and the ethnicities and cultures the movie shamefully fails to represent .  br    br   for example  the story with the latino man with the little white girl in the park  who gets mistaken by two ladies as her manny  male nanny  when in fact he  s the father . notwithstanding the last scene of this part was unnecessary from a dramatic  construction point of view  it would have been far more interesting to end it when the mother and boyfriend  stepfather are strutting the girl away   it is frankly a bit disgusting that the scene where we learn for sure that the girl  s father is latino also must inform us that he is a sexually desirable dancer . what  the dad can  t be just some guy from south america  now that he  s obviously hot  is the audience better prepared to accept that he had a kid with a middle  to  upper  class white woman  are we that naive as to require such  as if a mexican construction worker would obviously be too unpalatable .  br    br   it  s not my place to dictate where the movie should have gone . but in every conceivable set  up and plot twist  the direction taken screams status quo  appeals to safety . all these stories could have been made more interesting  even if we were forced to keep the single  dimensionality of the characters inhabiting them  at the very least by not choosing from standard and obvious stereotypes . asian girl living in chinatown being leered at by a scraggly old white guy  how  bout an asian cougar pursuing a white college kid instead . again  i  m not saying the entire conceit has to be changed . it  s just that every . damn . story premise . is so hackneyed   and thus they fail to convey anything about why one might love new york  outside the trite . the real way to have improved the film would be to have written a script worth reading .  br    br   i will concede the pleasantness of the soundtrack  the good pacing of the movie  even if what was being paced was  well  dredge   and the general feel of many of the scenes . the movie was just fine to sit through  and i wouldn  t dissuade anyone from doing so . however  it is telling that the most significant homage paid to non  superficiality is when the old opera singer says  paraphrased   that  s what i love about new york everyone  s from a different place .  well  you wouldn  t know it from watching this one .  ,0
sort of family parody blending  an officer and a gentleman    heartbreak ridge    full metal jacket   and without doubt other movies i am not able to remember now  into a rather dull movie  with some bright spots . the gags are always there where you would expect them  and damon wayans  s lines are  well  predictable . as i said  unfortunately this movie never surprises you . . .  ,0
made me think about it for days after seeing it . that to me is the mark of a great movie . eyes wide shut had the same effect on me . i am tired of these people requiring these happy hollywood cookie  cutter endings . i am planning on going to see it again tonight to understand the plot a little better  but regardless  the emotional messages of the movie were totally felt .  ,1
the haunting  if you have seen the original  you know a great ghost story  it  s perfection on film . it  s a haunting tale of  people who go into a haunted house and with the simple trick of sound and movements  it terrified people . it still remains effective to this day if you appreciate film . so when the haunting was remade in      a lot of people pretty much had the same reaction  what  why  what the  but in my opinion if a remake is respectful enough and just wants to reinvent the story for the newer generation  i  m pretty cool with it . this is definitely not the case  this is just a disrespectful boring shame that will waste your time and i guarantee will deliver no scares pfft  pg     what where they thinking  not much apparently .  br    br   when her mother dies and her sister evicts her  nell receives a phone call  telling her about an ad for an insomnia study run by doctor david marrow at hill house  a secluded manor . upon arrival  nell meets mr . and mrs . dudley  a strange pair of caretakers who do not stay on the property after dark . shortly thereafter  two other participants in the study arrive  wild theo and  bad sleeper  luke sanderson along with doctor marrow . unknown to the participants  doctor marrow  s true purpose is to study the psychological response to fear . each night  the caretakers chain the gate outside hill house  preventing anyone from getting in or out until morning  when the caretakers open the lock . there are no working telephones inside hill house and the nearest town is several miles away . doctor marrow revels the story of hill house . the house was built by hugh crain  crain built the house for his wife  hoping to fill it with a large family full of children  however all of crain  s children died during birth . crain  s wife killed herself before the house was finished  and crain became a recluse . the first night  theo and nell begin to experience strange phenomenon within the house  including odd noises and inexplicable temperature changes . nell is confronted after the main hallway is vandalized with the words  welcome home  eleanor   and becomes extremely distraught  setting out to prove that the house is haunted by the souls of those victimized by crain  s cruelty . she learns that crain built his fortune by exploiting kidnapped children for slave labor and murdering them when they were of no more use to him . he then burned the bodies in the house  s fireplace to hide any evidence . she also learns that crain had a second wife named carolyn  of whom nell is descended . everyone thinks she  s crazy while nell is convinced this is where she belongs .  br    br   seriously  i suggest you stay away from this film  it  s really stupid and pointless . not to mention the actress the played nell  lili taylor completely annoyed me  her performance  her look  just everything about her  don  t get me started on things i would do just to not see her in film again . catherine zeta jones just didn  t fit in her role as well and liam neeson  a wonderful actor wasted talent once again . the effects are way over the top and too computerized  i just can  t believe that they would trash a wonderful classic with this crud . believe me  if you are going to be afraid of something  be afraid of seeing how you can turn a great ghost story into an annoying piece of overblown stupid . oh  this film is already hurting me  just don  t see it  it  s bad .  br    br        ,0
judaai was a bold film by raj kanwar at it  s time in     when such a topic was damn out of the box  br    br   to give him his credit he does succeed in showing how greed changes a person and to what extent the person can go to get what she wants  br    br   the film however is damn melodramatic  many places ridiculous  br    br   one wonders why anil doesn  t buy a tv for his wife  when he earns so much just to show how poor he is   br    br   the twist is well handled but the handling is straight out of    s the johny  paresh comedy which entertains here and there stands out as a sore thumb as it doesn  t fit in the story  br    br   even there are several cringeworthy scenes  br    br   direction by raj kanwar is adequate though at times too melodramatic music is okay but most songs look forced  br    br   anil does his part well sridevi is excellent in her part urmila is decent amongst rest kader khan is as usual johny lever is funny  paresh irritates farida is decent  ,0
i saw this cinematic wretchedness in a dollar theater with a friend in      back when the tickets actually sold for    . this is the only film i have ever walked out on  with my friend  while the idiocy that is the  laser bra      sketch was on screen  . evidently  my and my friend  s reaction to the film was a common one . it is not that i found the film offensive  either as an    year  old or now   but rather that it is mind  numbingly stupid and patently unfunny  devoid even of the unintended humor that makes a ed wood film watchable . this is the real reason why nbc refused to air it  rather than a failure to comprehend mr . mike  s  vision   unless  of course  his vision was to drive the film  s backers into bankruptcy  .  br    br   i remained surprised to this day that this film does not seem to have made any published    worst films of all time  list . it certainly makes mine . you have been warned .  ,0
i  m on the opposite end of the previous comment .  br    br   first of all  i don  t think this was intended to be a straight sequel to  the jerk  . i mean  it  s not titled  the jerk   . . . it  s  the jerk  too   which leads me to believe that while a lot of the character names are the same  it actually revolves around a completely different person .  br    br   think about it virtually no connection to the previous movie  other than character names a totally different story different cast and the fact that it  s a partial musical .  br    br   i say give this movie some credit . it does have plenty of laughs in it . . mark blankfield at his prime .  ,1
my school  s drama club will be putting this show in the spring of      and i can only hope we  re as good as this  i watched this film recently as sort of  research  for my role  rosie alvarez   and i  d just like to say  vanessa williams is the coolest   br    br   wow  the casting for this movie was right  on  with one exception  . jason alexander  oh my gawd  is there anything he can  t do  he was the most wonderful albert peterson ever  i especially loved all of his funny facial expressions and dancing during  put on a happy face   he is so great  vanessa williams  as i said before  is the coolest . she was a beautiful rosie  and her transition from secretary to seductress was totally believable . tyne daly was hilarious as albert  s obnoxious mother and george wendt was superb as the annoyed mr . mcafee  however i loved paul lynde  s performance in the     version   . brigitta dau cracked me up as ursula merkle she really hammed it up  and marc kudisch was an awesome conrad birdie . . .  suffer    br    br   there was only one casting that i didn  t understand  and  as you  ll see from previous comments  many other people didn  t understand . chynna phillips as kim mcafee  what was that  i mean she  s really pretty and very talented  but . . . she looks a bit too old for the role . eh  maybe i  m delusional .  br    br   okay well anyways  i highly recommend this movie . it  ll leave you smiling   br    br    ,1
three tales are told in this film  that seemed to have been shot without knowledge of this being a combined vignette film . the makers relate the three vignettes by having them all connected to shrink martin kove  although you never see some of the leads with kove .  br    br   the first vignette has sexy vivian schilling  a woman afraid of everything under the sun  she makes adrian monk look brave   having a paranoia laced evening at home alone . you will literally scream at vivian for doing some ridiculous things . she spends the majority of her time in a nighty which shows off her amazing features . but her film is the worst if not the most nail  biting .  br    br   the second vignette is owned by bill paxton as he portrays the roommate from hell . his geeky roommate allows him to take complete advantage of him  and bill does so whenever he can .  br    br   the last vignette was funny as a man fears that death will take him at any moment  much like his pal who choked to death on an olive .  br    br   not very interesting  as the movie as a whole seems chopped together with very little thought involved . a must for bill paxton fans .  ,0
i just watched this movie today and not only is it  terrible and awful but it looks like the director just got a few friends together to make a movie about a sick man . i also think that this movie has the look of a porn video with it  s clear crisp just filmed view .  br    br   thank heavens i work in a video store and i didn  t have to pay for it cause this movie is crap x infinity . . do not buy or rent this movie      you  d have a better time watching dude where  s my car than this piece of crap  and that  s not saying a lot for that movie either .  br    br   the acting is lousy and the movie is just very unwatchable . i was watching this movie and i wanted to kill myself during and after the movie .  br    br   i walked home and threw up after watching this piece of dirt movie  i then took a shower and burnt my clothes .  br    br   if i had half a mind i would of took the movie outside and burned it too cause no one should be subjected to it . . . well maybe members of al queda . . especially the ones we have in custody and also child rapists who are in prison on life sentences with out parole . . . . just make a set up like a clock work orange  and then force these cheese head to watch it over and over again .  ,0

i didn  t even know this was originally a made  for  tv movie when i saw it  but i guessed it through the running time . it has the same washed  out colors  bland characters  and horrible synthesized music that i remember from the    s  plus a  social platform  that practically screams  afterschool special  . anyhoo .  br    br   rona jaffe  s  thank you  mazes and monsters was made in the heyday of dungeons  dragons  a pen  and  paper rpg that took the hearts of millions of geeks around america . i count myself one of said geeks  tho i have never played dd specifically i have dabbled in one of its brethren . mm was also made in the heyday of dd  s major controversy  that it was so engrossing that people could lose touch with reality  be worshiping satan without knowing  blah blah . i suppose it was a legitimate concern at one point  if extremely rare  but it dates this movie horrendously .  br    br   we meet  young college students  who play the aptly named mazes and monsters  to socialize and have a little time away from mundane life . except that mm as presented is more boring than their mundane lives . none of the allure of gaming is presented here  and jay jay  s request to take mm into  the real world  comes out of nowhere . it  s just an excuse to make one of the characters go crazy out of nowhere also  though at that point we don  t really care . jay jay  robbie  kate and daniel are supposed to be different  but they  re all rich waspy prigs who have problems no one really has .  br    br   but things just continue  getting worse in more ways than one . the low budget comes dreadfully clear   i love the  entrance  sign and cardboard cutout to the forbidden caverns  robbie  pardu shows why he  s not a warrior in the oafiest stabbing scene ever  and the payoff atop the  two towers  is unintentionally hilarious . tom hanks  blubbering  jay jay  what am i doing here   made me laugh for minutes on end . definitely the low point in his career .  br    br   don  t look at it as a cogent satire  just a laughable piece of    s tv trash  and you  ll still have a good time . that is  if you can stay awake . the majority is mostly boring  but it  s all worthwhile for pardu  s breakdown at the end . at least tom hanks has gotten better . not that he could go much worse from here .  ,0
i am amazed at the amount of praise that is heaped on this movie by other commentators . to me it was rather a disappointment  especially the combination of historical facts  fantasy and the main character  s internal turmoil does not work at all  in vonnegut  s book slaughterhouse five and even in george roy hill  s adaptation for the screen it does  . credibility is often overstretched . too many questions are left open . did i miss some central points  or did i fail to spot the lines that supposedly connect the dots   br    br   a boy called campbell  jr .  grows up in upstate new york . at home his father has many technical trade papers and one book . it has photographs of heaps of dead bodies in it . the boy leafs through the book  his dad doesn  t like his doing that . what should this tell me  the family moves away from upstate new york to berlin . bang . it is      the boy is a married man in berlin and a theater playwright . what kind of plays does he write  in what language  is he successful  his wife is an actress and looks glamorous . the parents move back to the usa and invite their son to do the same . he does not . why  because having grown up in germany he feels more german than american  because he is successful  because his wife is  because he likes his life there  because he likes the nazis  because he is just plain lazy and doesn  t like change  don  t ask me .  br    br   possibly  the man just does not care  is not interested in politics  is a kind of an existentialist . he states that he is deeply in love with his wife . he speaks of his republic of two  meaning he and his wife  . there is little to no evidence proving his love for his wife in the movie  it much more seems a republic of one .  br    br   on the request of an american agent campbell  jr .  agrees to broadcast anti semitic nazi hate propaganda to american listeners as a device for transmitting encrypted messages to american authorities who read between the lines . the crucial meeting with the agent on a berlin park bench is short  unexciting and anti climactic  the decision to play along comes pretty easily with no explanation  the rise up to broadcaster seems to be uneventful and apparently fast .  br    br   so now we have campbell  jr .  presenting himself over the air as the last free american . the scheme for transmitting secret messages is fairly realistic and exciting  although one wonders what happened when campbell  jr .  really and honestly had to cough  hiccup etc .  must have scrambled the messages terribly  . anyway  the nazis lose  the wife dies  touring in the crimean for german troops  i never heard such tours really happened on german front lines in ww ii   campbell  jr .  says he goes to the russian front but does not go  is captured by an american soldier who recognizes his mug  how come    is dragged to a sight  seeing tour in auschwitz  is then released and resettled with the help of the crucial agent somewhere in the city of new york .  br    br   and this is where the story really starts  br    br   bang . from now on it is like a short story by paul auster . it is      campbell  jr .  lives in new york tenement as a has  been and mourns the loss of his wife . nobody really cares  or do they  yes  somehow they do  and his neighbors offer some sort of distraction . auschwitz survivors . a painter . some american supremacists discover  him and want him to be their figurehead . they even find his presumed dead wife for him  or is she his wife  anyway  in the end campbell  jr .  calls in at the israeli consulate  and they obligingly give him the big war criminal treatment  placing him in the cell adjacent to adolf eichmann  s . he writes his life story and  once this task finished  hangs himself on the typewriter  s ribbons without getting sooty the least bit .  br    br   while i can see that there must be an issue of guilt and of loss  i just had the impression that the main character is a person who at all times is pretty indifferent to everything and hardly capable of love for anyone . so i found it difficult to sympathize for this looser who mourns his loss . amazingly  many reviewers focus on his status as a potential war hero  having put his reputation at stake for playing the last free american . i assume according to them this took a lot of courage . as a matter of fact  however  the movie suggests that by accepting the assignment campbell created for himself a win  win situation  as he would have been politically on the safe side no matter who had won the war . the danger of his being uncovered never comes up during the first part of the story .  br    br   one might argue  that the whole story is a dreamlike fantasy and that nobody should bother with historical accuracy or a logical development of the story which explains everything . but even then it fails to make a point  primarily  i suspect  because the love affair in the republic of two falls completely flat . this is a pity  especially if you consider that the wife was played by sheryl lee  a talented  versatile and sensuous actress . she has much too little screen time and is forced to use a ridiculous german accent . another somehow neglected aspect are the different texts  confession  broadcast and hidden messages   but i guess this is largely unfilmable . maybe i should give the book a chance .  ,0
one of the best tarzan films is also one of its most action packed  and graphic  .  br    br   picking up a year or so after tarzan the ape man  niel hamilton  s holt has asked a rich friend to finance a safari back to the elephants graveyard to collect ivory . his friend arrives also carrying dresses and perfumes that holt hopes to use to win jane back from tarzan . before they can leave holt finds his map stolen and it becomes a mad dash to try and capture a competing expedition . when they finally over take the thieves they find the whole party dead and themselves surrounded . they have no choice but to fight their way out and soon find they are out of the frying pan and into the fire . eventually tarzan and jane show up and everyone is off on even more adventures .  br    br   infamous film was heavily censored to reduce the graphic violence  its graphic even by todays standards . it probably would get a pg    and to remove all hint of nudity   there is a several minute long nude swim scene involving jane that is full frontal in its nudity  it was only recently restored  . its clear watching the restored version why this film was reduced by   minutes in its run time for tv . as it stands in its restored version this is a very adult film that is romantic  touching  action filled and everything else that a movie should be . its an amazing film by almost any standard . best of all its the sort of film that plays well both as a stand alone adventure  one need not to have seen the first film to enjoy it  but its also a film that deepens the characters and themes that were set up in that original film . its an amazing thing .  br    br   i really like this film a great deal .  br    br   if there are any flaws to the film  its perhaps that the film hasn  t aged well . the rear screen is often very obvious  there are gorilla suits for many of the apes and some of the other effects are more quaint rather than convincing . however on almost every other level this film is top notch .  br    br   you really owe it to yourself to see this . make yourself a big bowl of popcorn and curl up on the couch and just let yourself drift back to a simpler time . this is one of the great adventures .  ,1
these reviews that claim this movie is so bad its good are going way overboard with that one . this movie does not have the guilty pleasure badness that leonard part   battlefield earth and gigli had . those movies were entertaining in their awfulness but this pile of dinosaur dung is so bad its painful . i haven  t been in this much pain watching a bad movie since i watched baby geniuses and superbabies . before i start the review let me tell you the story . theodore rex is a    million dollar bust the new line cinema refused to put in theaters . they cut the losses sending it straight to video making it the most expensive straight  to  video movie in decades . whoopi caved in to be in this disaster after a huge paycheck .  br    br   plot a millionaire clones dinosaurs so he can launch missiles at the sun which would kill mankind and start another ice age . a female cop named katie coltrane and an idiotic dinosaur named theodore rex reluctantly team up to stop him after the death of a buddy dinosaur .  br    br   the plot is given to you in the beginning of the movie which robs the movie of all its mystery . then you have to deal with the fact that this movie is actually quite awful . whoopi looks agitated and is trying to wing it with her performance but to no avail . theodore rex is flat out annoying and his bumbling behavior wears thin after five minutes on screen . most of the jokes revolve around him threatening to bite people and hitting people with his tail  on accident and on purpose  . i thought burglar was bad but it takes a backseat to theodore rex the worst movie of whoopi  s career .  br    br   don  t let anybody tell you this monstrosity is bad enough to be enjoyable . i didn  t see that when i watched this movie . all i saw was a train wreck that was written by people that must have had some sick admiration for movie howard the duck . the humor is on that level and theodore rex looks like the inbred cousin of barney . utterly painful from start to finish .  ,0

 . . . and in no way as clean  logical  and understandable as in pictured in that pathetic sum of tired hollywood cliches .  br    br   i  m    and i  ve spent   years of my life struggling through delusional phobia and paranoid hallucinations . like the main character in the film  i was successful mainly because of logic  because i kept thinking over and over to keep delusion away from reality  and to know what was really going on and what wasn  t . in the end  i was really successful because of medication  by the way  but i certainly escaped madness because i knew before i took medication the difference between what was real and what wasn  t .  br    br   so  i feel entitled to tell you that this movie is a total fraud . not only does it cheat with the main character  s story  who wasn  t faithful to his wife  who was bisexual  something really important here   but mostly  it shows a comforting  tamed view of schizophrenia  which is entirely missing the point .  br    br   schizophrenia is a mind structure  not a disease . a schizophrenic isn  t a  normal man with a disease   it  s someone who from early on views and feels things differently from most people  for him  things like time  space  and people  s personalities aren  t solid things . he feels it can be bent  it can change  it can mutate  and maybe even disappear . to cope with this  a schizophrenic has a rich  very imaginative inner world which  normal  people don  t expect  but he  s trapped in it because he can  t relate with most people  and his world gets poorer and poorer until he finishes in a blank  delusive dead end .  br    br   this is very different to what  s depicted in this ridiculous  cure   tear  jerking movie . it should be violently frightening . people other than the main character should appear strange  weird and absurd  like in lynch  s  eraserhead   for example . there should be really impressive  weird  gross hallucinations  because that  s what schizophrenia is all about . it  s not about details .  br    br   i mean  watch  naked lunch    lost highway   read p . k . dick  s  martian time  split  or  ubik   do watch  the cell    perfect blue    dark city   or play  american mcgee  s alice  on pc  and you may have a vague idea of what it  s like . don  t watch the  feel good  movie of the month  with banal situations  cleaned characters and visuals  and stupid plot tricks .  the cell  is the most accurate movie about a schizophrenic  s mind  his visions and his inner consistency  it  s violent  weird  confusing  and very  very scary .  br    br   once again  schizophrenia isn  t about details  it  s not a neat  tame trick played to you . it jumps in your face and won  t let you go  walls fall apart  people turn into strange hostile creatures  you feel like you go backward in time  you  re not sure you  re who you think you are  everything feels . . . strange  unnatural . believe me  this is much much more than what  s depicted in this soap  like melodrama  ,0

the worst movie i have seen in quite a while . interesting first half with some engaging  terse dialogue among dubious characters in a late  night bar . the movie then degenerates into a shapeless succession of scenes aiming for visual shock  read disgust  without any redeeming observations or lessons in humanity or anything else .  br    br   i wanted to walk out  but the director was present at this showing and my politeness preventing me from showing him disrespect . still  time is precious  as the director himself observed in his intro  and i really begrudge the time i wasted on the second half of this one .  br    br   saving graces were the three main characters in the first half of the movie  especially the female lead .  ,0
i  ve been trying to find out about this series for ages  thank you  imdb  i saw this as a child and have never quite been able to get it out of my mind . as a   year old  of course  i was particularly struck by the episode of the cyclops  which was absolutely chilling  i talked about it so much that my older brother made me a cyclops out of a plastic cave man figurine  which i still have  what i also remember  though  was the atmosphere  which was unusual right from the beginning  mysterious  austere  and extremely authentic . when i read the original many years later i experienced that same sensation . it  s a very hard thing to capture  and probably impossible in hollywood . every  odyssey  i  ve seen since has been an enormous let  down . the characters in this series seemed genuine  real people  ancient greek people  and not some hollywood stars in costumes . this is a real masterpiece  but  why is it not better known  and why isn  t it available on vhs or dvd  i would just love to have the chance to see this again   ,1
tony arzenta  a sicilian hit  man or professional killer  decides to leave the business  and his former employers do not agree . in terms of content  this highly enjoyable action movie doesn  t have one in terms of sheer amusement  it is funit is very melodramatic  violent  quite brutal  the car chases are notable .  arzenta  is an unpretentious  yet very likable filmmuch better than the current hollywoodian trash that gets the same label . it comes from delon  s rather short flirting with the italian b cinema of the    s . it carefully uses delon  s tough guy persona  belonging to the gallery of bad  ass thugs that he made in his youth .  br    br   i enjoyed very much the fact that delon made this film  that he had a role in a good eurocrime flick .  br    br   the score is very fine  with a good introductory songmaking felt that gusto that the italians had for the film considered as a synthetic work  where the musical art has an important part .  br    br   in tony arzenta  big guns  no way out the very appealing erika blanc    years in     appears as an unnamed hooker . meanwhile  arzenta  s girlfriend  sandra  is played by carla gravina  a starlet that practically left the movies after     .  br    br    arzenta  is interestingly filmedan ambitious visual conception  some expressionistic peculiar angles . the movie was directed by the prolific duccio tessari  the one who made also zorro  the delon comedy  . needless to mention that these two films  tony arzenta       and zorro  are very unlike . the first one is a bloody melodramatic violent action movie   the second is a lighthearted comedy  more kindred to a spoof  though remarkably coherent and skilfully made . duccio tessari directed films like kiss kiss . . . bang bang        sons of satan  the bloodstained butterfly  viva la muerte . . . tua   tough guys        safari express        etc . .  ,1
hi everyone my names larissa i  m   years old when i was about  years old i watch curly sue and it knocked my socks of i have been watching that movie for a long time in fact about   minutes ago i just got done watching it . alisan porter is a really good actor and i love that movie its so funny when she is dealing the cards . every time i watch that movie at the end of it i cry its so said i know i  m only   years old but its such a touching story its really weird thats alisan is   years old now . every time i watch a movie someone is always young and the movie comes out like a year after they make it and when u watch it and find out how old the person in the movie really is u wounder how they can go from one age to the next . like harry potter . that movie was also great but still daniel was about   years old in the first movie and i was about   . so how could he go from   to   in about  years and i  m only   . i  m not sure if he is   right now i think he is almost   but thats kind of weird when u look at one movie and on the next there about  years old then u when they were only  in the last . i  m not sure i have a big imagination and i like to revile it . i am kind of a computer person but i like to do a lot of kids things also . i am very smart like curly sue in the movie but one thing i don  t like in the movie is when that guy calls the foster home and makes curly sue get taken away i would kill that guy if he really had done it in real life . well i  m going to stop writing i know a write a lot sometimes but kids do have a lot in there head that need to get out and if they don  t kids will never get to learn .  br    br   larissa  ,1
i really don  t get all the adulation that this film has received . it  s mawkish  unnecessarily manipulative and dodges many of the big issues  ie nash  s affairs and his predilection for having sex with men in public places . that  i suppose  in the context of a commercial hollywood film is just about tolerable  but what  s with all the praise for russell crowe  s performance  the man just seems to shuffle about  clutching his briefcase and wearing a grungy hat and somehow that seems to qualify as fine acting  anyone who has ever known a person with mental health problems will realise that crowe  s performance is little short of caricature . it is also rather offensive . and  dare i say  just on the right side of being truly terrible  ,0
ah  domino is actually a breath of fresh air  something new to the cinema world . i enjoyed the movie a lot because of the intricate plot  the varied characters  and the intense camera effects . i  ve seen some complain about the camera work and  in fact  according to the creators themselves  the flashy and wild shots were all the culmination of mistakes made through time . all of what you see was the desired effect . perhaps some complain because something quite like this has never been done before  although that  s what sets it apart . in a deeper aspect  what you are seeing is just how domino sees things through her eyes  think about it .  br    br   when it comes to the story  i don  t see anything quite bad about it . despite it  s  messy  nature  according to some  it is in fact just a rapid form of storytelling . the plot really isn  t all that hard to follow  if you actually focus on what  s going on . maybe it  s just me because i see movies from many different aspects such as the acting  the plot  etc . i  m no  interpreter  or anything who picks movies apart  it just comes to me . with that said  i believe this is quite an excellent movie indeed  despite it  s future as a cult  classic  blockbuster  or whatever .  br    br   and the characters  well there  s no doubting how varied the cast is . i believe the cast is excellent as they all do fine jobs portraying their characters effectively  that  s what makes a movie ladies and gentlemen . the characters are all very unique and a plus is that you get to witness a small piece of each one of their lives  setting them apart even further . basically  i personally loved the cast and characters .  br    br   all those who bash and burn this film perhaps just don  t see it as i do  or it just doesn  t appeal to them . no matter  this is a great film in it  s own right  no  it  s a great film period .  ,1
this film contains the one ingredient that all revenge movies should have and that is true emotion . sorrow  love  laughter  anger . there are so many emotions thrown into this film . from start to finish this film is immensely captivating . the plot on paper sounds like the usually rubbish that is mostly thrown in the faces of the audiences but don  t be mistaken  this film is powerful . washington as always puts on a great performance .  br    br   the plot in a nutshell man suffers from depression  a young girl brings life into him  kids gets kidnap  man wants revenge . doesn  t sound like anything special but it far superior than any other similar film out there . for instant  taken is a similar film but when you compare them both  man on fire wins hands down . the characters are engaging and everyone puts in a great performance and the directing is great . mexico city feels alive  it looks like mexico city  it smells like mexico city . everything is portrayed brilliantly . the style of direction was something i enjoyed and brought the best out of mexico city  br    br   this is one of those films you  ll bring out once a year to watch again or a film that you  ll beg your family and friends to watch . from start to finish you are rooting for the main protagonist  making it a roller  coaster journey . there enough action to keep you happy  there enough character development to please you and then there  s washington to bring a smile to your face . watch this film  you won  t be disappointed  ,1
first off  i would just like to say what a big fan of bette midler  s i am . stella is a very good movie with a wonderful cast  bette midler  john goodman  trini alvarado  stephen collins  marsha mason  this is one of my favorite films of all time . it deals with a mother raising a child on her own  she goes through a lot of things that are out of her way to bring up her daughter jenny played wonderfully by trini alvarado . this movie is very good and i suggest that you pick up a copy to watch it . roger ebert gave is     stars  and it deserved   wonderful  i give it  out of    ,1
what is very french about this film is the time taken to establish the two leading characters . this might require a bit of patience  especially since neither is  attractive  in the typical hollywood definition of such . however  once the  heist  kicks in  the film rushes forward quickly  perhaps at times too quickly . but it is a real rollercoaster ride and if you don  t look too closely it is all quite believable . the kind of film that you know hollywood would have botched up .  ,1
how this movie escaped the wrath of mst  k i  ll never know .  gymkata  is a ridiculous action movie  filled  or is that empty   with paper  thin plots  dumb characters  and preposterous situations . but take it from me  if you enjoy watching poor  yet goofy  movies  you will enjoy  gymkata  a great deal .  br    br   the action centers around a gymnast who is chosen by government agents  at least i think they were government agents  to become a spy . you see his dad was another quasi  government agent  who has gone missing competing in this game  called  eloquently   the game .  so the gymnast  played blandly by kurt thomas  trains to compete in this game and find out what happened to his lost dad .  br    br   sounds promising doesn  t it  okay  so it doesn  t but still  that bare bones plot sypnopsis doesn  t begin to describe the joys of this movie . they can be found in the movie  s strange details . like the gymnast  s mysterious asian girlfriend  who doesn  t speak for the first half hour of the movie  then all of a sudden begins to talk  and doesn  t shut up for the rest of the time  or the really tough shirtless bad guy who likes to make and break  the game   s non  existent rules whenever he so pleases . and of course there  s our hero  s delightful romp through the  village of the crazies   evidently that  s the place  s real name   . nice place to visit  but i wouldn  t want to live there .  br    br   but where this movie really shines is the action scenes . since our protagonist is a gymnast  the director thought it wise to stick gymnastic equipment into the back alleys and town squares of middle eastern cities  so that our gymkata master would be better able to use his gymnast skills to fight the scourge of evil on parallel bars and pummel horses . it has to be seen to be believed .  br    br   one interesting thing of note . a lot  i  d say about half the cast  dies from being shot with an arrow . interesting because the arrows are the only believable effects or action in the entire movie . if these were indeed effects  my one major note of compliment to whoever devised these very realistic arrows wounds . more likely  this was the film  s way of not paying extras . nevertheless   gymkata  deserves a look if you can see it without paying and are looking for some silliness that is an easy target for riffing .  br    br    ,0
  the straight story  is a truly beautiful movie about an elderly man named alvin straight  who rides his lawnmower across the country to visit his estranged  dying brother . but that  s just the basic synapsis . . . this movie is about so much more than that . this was richard  s farnworth  s last role before he died  and it  s definitely one that he will be remembered for . he  s a stubborn old man  not unlike a lot of the old men that you and i probably know .  br    br    the straight story  is a movie that everyone should watch at least once in their lives . it will reach down and touch some part of you  at least if you have a heart  it will .  ,1
forbidden planet rates as landmark in science fiction  carefully staying within  hard  aspects of the genre  science   not fantasy  ergo nerds will love it  while still playing with imagery and ideas of contemporary     s values . morbius  s isolated house is a model of modern design with open spaces that step out into sculpted gardens  a swimming pool  and the ultimate home appliance robby the robot .  a housewife  s dream   exclaims the captain after lunch and a demonstration of the robot  s abilities to synthesize food and disintegrate waste .  br    br   also revealing to the     s fruedian psychology rears its head in the id explanation  although morbius dismisses it as an outdated concept . there is a touch of the pacific war drama in the battle with the invisible monster and life aboard the saucer . perhaps most timely is the post  atomic fear that science is the enemy  and arrogant scientists will unwittingly bring down destruction in their blind quest for knowledge .  br    br   yet the suburban drama presented by forbidden planet seems uniquely fresh in the sci  fi genre . they aren  t swashbucklers or heroes  but ordinary sailors crossing the galaxy with a serviceman  s crudeness and honesty . the good guys drive the flying saucer  and the aliens are so long gone we don  t even know what they looked like   although their music er   atmospheric tonalities  by bebe and louis barron are remarkably futuristic today . the views from morbius  house are truly alien with jagged cliffs and pink bonsais . the interior of the saucer is just this side of buck rogers . there  s a lot visually to like . although we get fantastic monsters and robots for the kiddies  forbidden planet is a cerebral movie  slow paced and talky . it is working on many levels at once hard sci  fi against space adventure  philosophical against domestic .  br    br   there are many suburban touches . in spite of all their space  talk  the soldiers are dressed for the golf course . morbius  fatal discovery is a humble educational facility  a schoolhouse . the most interesting character is morbius  daughter altaira . having never seen a man she is unashamedly forward to the crew . she  s a post  madonna teen who designs her own space  age clothes and takes every opportunity to change outfits   imagine christina aguilera with a household replicator . men watching the film might see her as a naive girl in a minidress  but every woman knows there is no such thing as a naive girl in a minidress . anne francis deserves better recognition for humiliating the leut with kisses . alas we  ll never know if she was  working  him as he suspects  since the captain interrupts and becomes a more interesting target for her attention . she is the character who makes the important change in the film . shocked that her father compares the dead doc to the other  embeciles  in his landing party  she turns away from her father  her home  to leave with the sailors for earth . it  s this act of defiance  of maturity  that sends morbius  id creature over the edge  allegorically destroying its creator just as it did thousands of centuries earlier to the krell .  br    br   maybe the krell had teenage daughters too . . .   ,1
the fight scenes play like slow  motion jackie chan and the attempts at wit are pathetic  worst pun by far  guess what  this time i heard you coming   . the stars are a mismatched pair brandon lee  despite the terrible lines he has to say  actually shows traces of charisma and screen charm  things that dolph lundgren is completely free of  at least in this movie  . note to the director in the future  please stay away from any love scenes  especially when your main actress won  t do any nudity and you have to rely extensively on a body double .        ,0
i have given this show  i have only watched seven episodes  four stars because most of her jokes  set  ups appear to fail . some are not funny outright  but some are amusing   in a   year old boy kind of way . she reminds me of that new york painter who throws paint upon a canvas  calls it art and sells it for a lot of money . silverman throws out what she  s got  including the kitchen sink  while she prays that a few things stick to the wall in her effort to be funny but different .  br    br   however what she  s  got  often times is not enough  as though she lacks the kind of follow  through a good comedian needs to succeed .  br    br   the whole enterprise is like an under done potato .  ,0
green street  as it was called in the uk  or hooligans is a bad film . the story is full of fantastical ideas and premises that anyone who lives in england  has been to a football match or knows the first thing about football will spot immediately .  br    br   my first main gripe with hooligans is the poor casting of the two main characters . don  t get me wrong  i like elijah wood and have a great respect for his work  but despite his best efforts he struggled to pull off this role . the main motivation for his character is anger at the system and anger at betrayal  however he spends much of the film placid and cheery  only displaying his pent up aggression in one brief scene towards the end of the film . this linked with his looks and physique make him a thoroughly unconvincing addition to a gang of football hooligans . at no point during the film was i convinced that a  he could handle himself in a fight against such thugs and b  the  firm  of thugs would accept such a person into their fold .  br    br   the other main character is played by charlie hunnam . charlie looks the part  and is fairly convincing as a thug . unfortunately  being a native of newcastle upon tyne in the north of england  he demonstrates the worst east london accent since dick van dyke tried to go cock  en  y in marry poppins . details such as this probably will not bother an american audience who will be less attuned to regional dialect in the uk  but being from the uk it was a problem i couldn  t ignore and it contributed to ruining the movie for me . the supporting cast all gave convincing performances and were well cast  especially the role of bover . the lad playing this character would have been much more suited to the main role that charlie played . with a film like this  you have to convince the audience that your characters are plausible  unfortunately  the casting failed . imagine if you made a film like the godfather and had sean hayes  jack  from will and grace playing michael corleone  s part . you would not be convinced . the story in hooligan is also full in implausibilities . i am no football hooligan  but i am a fantatical football fan . i know how cliquey a group of  regular  football supporters can be  as such it deem it impossible for a non  football fan  who is not a fan of the club in question  is not from the area in question and not even of english nationality to be embraced by a  firm  who equate to a secret organisation in some severe cases . my final  and biggest  problem with this film  is the way it portrays football hooligans . i take objection to the film  s idea that despite being very violent individuals  hooligans are excused as they live by some sort of code of ethics in their own world and should be admired for being brave and loyal to each other . this is complete rubbish . football hooligans are complete scum . they take football  the national sport of england and use it as an excuse to terrorise  frighten and intimidate people . they only represent a tiny percentage of football fans but give the whole game and people of this country a bad reputation . they are not brave or loyal  they are cowardly and evil . if the  gse  in this film truly loved their club  west ham  why would the devote their lives to being a stain on its name . hooligans are an embarrassment to football and to english society . football hooligans do for the reputation of football what hitler did to the reputation of germans . although this film tries  intends to show the  gritty  side of football violence . it does nothing more than promote it as some kind of excusable activity for extreme fans of the sport . it does not show the poor innocent by  standers at football matches who have their day ruined by some idiot throwing coins  lighters  glass into the crowd . it does not show the innocent home and property owners who have to put up with graffiti and broken windows . it does not show the real fans of football clubs who suffer indignity and embarrassment when their teams supporters are banned from travelling to away matches or abroad to european games because the thugs among them ruin it for everyone . if you want to see a good film about football violence  watch the bbc drama  the firm  .  ,0
since most review  s of this film are of screening  s seen decade  s ago i  d like to add a more recent one  the film open  s with stock footage of b     s bombing germany  the film cut  s to oskar werner  s hauptmann  captain  wust character and his aide running for cover while making their way to hitler  s fuehrer bunker  once inside  they are debriefed by bunker staff personnel  the film then cut  s to one of many conference scene  s with albin skoda giving a decent impression of adolf hitler rallying his officer  s to  ultimate victory  while werner  s character is shown as slowly coming to realize the bunker denizen  s are caught up in a fantasy world  some non  bunker event  s are depicted  most notable being the flooding of the subway system to prevent a russian advance through them and a minor subplot involving a young member of the flak unit  s and his family  s difficulty in surviving  this film suffer  s from a number of detail inaccuracies that a german film made only   year  s after ww  should not have included the actor portraying goebbels  willy krause  wear  s the same uniform as hitler  including arm eagle  goebbels wore a brown nazi party uniform with swastika armband  the  ss  soldier  s wear german army camouflage  the well documented scene of hitler awarding the iron cross to boy  s of the hitler youth is shown as having taken place inside the bunker  it was done outside in the courtyard  and lastly  hitler  s suicide weapon is clearly shown as a belgian browning model      most account  s agree it was a walther ppk  some bit  s of acting also seem wholly inaccurate with the drunken dance scene near the end of the film being notable  this bit is shown as a cabaret skit  with a intoxicated wounded soldier  his arm in a splint  maniacally goose  stepping to music while a nurse does a combination striptease  belly dance  all by candlelight . . . this is actually embarrassing to watch  the most incredible bit is when werner  s captain wust gain  s an audience alone with skoda  s hitler  hitler is shown as slumped on a wall bench  drugged and delirious  when werner  s character begin  s to question him  hitler start  s screaming which bring  s in a ss guard who mortally wound  s werner  s character in the back with a gunshot  this fabricated scene is not based on any true historic account  werner  s character is then hauled off to die in a anteroom while hitler prepare  s his own ending  hitler  s farewell to his staff is shown but the suicide is off  screen  the final second  s of the movie show hitler  s funeral pyre smoke slowly forming into a ghostly image of the face of the dead oskar werner  hauptmann wust  this film is more allegorical than historical and anyone interested in this period would do better to check out more recent film  s such as the     remake  hitler the last   day  s  or the german film  downfall   der untergang  if they wish a more true accounting of this dramatic story  these last two film  s are based on first person eyewitness account  s  with  hitler the last   day  s  being compiled from gerhard boldt  s autobiography as a staff officer in the fuehrer bunker and  downfall  being done from hitler  s secretary  s recollection  s  the screen play for  der letzte akte  is taken from american nuremberg war crime  s trial judge michael musmanno  s book  ten day  s to die   which is more a compilation of event  s  many obviously fanciful  than eyewitness history  it is surprising that hugh trevor roper  s account   the last day  s of hitler  was never made into a film .  ,0
madison is not too bad  if you like simplistic  non  offensive   family  friendly  fare and  more importantly  if you know absolutely nothing about unlimited hydroplane racing . if  like me  you grew up with the sport and your heroes had names like musson  muncey  cantrell  slovak  etc .  prepare to be disappointed .  br    br   professional film critics have commented at length on the formulaic nature of the film and its penchant for utilizing every hackneyed sports clich in the book . i needn  t repeat what they  ve said . what i felt was sadly missing was any sense of the real excitement of unlimited hydro racing in the  glory years   which many would argue were already past in      .  br    br   yes  it was wonderful to see the old classic boats roaring down the course six abreast  though it was clear that the restored versions  hats off to the volunteers at the hydroplane and race boat museum  were being nursed through the scenes at reduced speed . but where was the sound  much of the thrill of the old hydros was the mind  numbing roar of six allison or rolls  merlin aircraft engines  wound up to rpm  s never imagined by their designers  hitting the starting line right in front of you . you didn  t hear it  you felt it . real hydro buffs know exactly what i  m talking about . there  s none of that in madison . instead  every racing scene is buried under what is supposed to be a  heroic  musical score .  br    br   and then there are the close  up shots of the drivers  riding smoothly and comfortably in the cockpits as if they were relaxing in the latest luxury limousines  in some cases taking time to smile evilly as they contemplate how best to thwart the poor home  town hero . or  in one particularly ridiculous shot  taking time to spot jake lloyd giving a  rocky  salute from a bridge pier . in reality  some unlimited drivers wore flak vests to minimize the beating they took as the boats slammed across the rock  hard water at speeds above    mph .  br    br   as one reviewer so aptly put it   the sport deserves better than this .   br    br   finally  since another user brought up anachronisms  i  ll add one the establishing shot of seattle shows the kingdome and safeco field . neither existed in      ,0

after leaving tv  s popular  the andy griffith show   don knotts gave movie stardom a valiant try with a series of inane but matine  pleasing comedy vehicles . unfortunately   the reluctant astronaut   filmed on the cheap  as were most of knotts  movies   is much worse than his others . don plays a small town schnook who gets accepted to astronaut training camp . . . but not as a candidate for space travel   they want him as their new janitor  some may say the weak satire capitalizes on americans  then  fresh fever for the new age of technology  but the flick is really just a dim excuse to keep restless children occupied . it gets off to a good start  with an ok set  up and nostalgic locations  but it becomes increasingly more spiritless and idiotic .  from   ,0
i have this movie on dvd and must have watched it thirty times by now . i must really love it  right  well  not really .  br    br   i was a surfer earlier in my life  and i loved the sport . to this day  i am fascinated by good surfing . riding giants has plenty of that  and thus i am a sucker for the thing . but i definitely have some bones to pick with it .  peralta  you listening   .  br    br   first  the movie has too little faith in its subject matter . the cutting and editing of the waves is such that the majority of them are sort of ruined . very  very few waves are actually shown ridden from start to finish . peralta seems addicted to a hyper kinetic  cut  and  pace method . it gets especially bad in the middle section on the spot mavericks in northern california . not a single wave is ridden start to finish . almost the entire section on mavericks  one third of the movie  is a jarring montage of clips with an equally jarring soundtrack . i can understand the effect peralta was trying to achieve with mavericks  as the place is a truly frightening mix of bone crushing waves in frigid open ocean chop  but he goes way too far . mavericks is not just a bad acid trip . waves are actually ridden there  even with great performances . it would have been good to see some of them . if peralta thinks this is a grand sport  and i am sure he does   then why does he insist on messing with the subject matter so much  at times  the editing reduces the movie to the inscrutable . there is one fast clip in the section on peahi in hawaii  which i still cannot understand . even if i run it on slow motion on dvd  the image is too fast to be decipherable . it must be a couple of frames in length at the max .  br    br   second  have the guys who made this thing ever learned about understatement  it is particularly galling to watch the narrated directors  version on dvd . these guys sound like two over  the  top valley girls . the same sentiment shows up in the main production . every thing is always so goddamn  amazing  etc . one character in particular is just plain obnoxious   sam george  the editor of surfer magazine  who is practically peeing in his pants every time he has anything to say . he is a super drag on the movie .  br    br   there is a tremendous amount of effort that went into this movie . i mean  just to get the old movie shots they have  and also  all of the interviews . the movie is a great story  and i think it is generally captivating entertainment . thematically it is well laid out  with the three parts centering around greg noll  jeff clark  and laird hamilton respectively . there are some uses of still photography that are phenomenal . in the directors  narration  they say it is a new type of  d technology  and it really works . the three principle characters shine  both in their interviews and in the water . as an athlete  laird hamilton is a revelation . he rises to the pinnacle of his sport in a way that i have only seen michael jordan do in basketball . and too  the story of his meeting his father is a gem . it really touched me .  br    br   it is just that the movie could have been so much more . the very last part of the movie  when the credits roll  gives a hint of what it could have been . there are some beautiful panoramic shots of waves with a magnificent soundtrack .  the soundtrack in the rest of the movie is rubbish  though you may like it if you are fan of the modern  frenetic school of rock .  anyway there  s my two cents . . .  ,1
 haven  t seen this film  haven  t even heard of this film  it wouldn  t surprise me . one of the few truly  independent  films produced in the last ten years  no studio had faith in the picture and it was never picked up for major distribution . the independent company kino films  gave boesman and lena a very limited run with virtually no promotion  and the majority of major film critics didn  t even bother reviewing it . i guess a movie based on a one act  one set play about the apartheid and its affect on two individuals never really had a chance in today  s market  and it  s the intelligent film  lover  s loss .  br    br   for the record  both angela bassett and danny glover deserved ocsar nominations  as did the cinematographer  but the film received such little fanfare that i can  t even blame the academy on that one . this is a film that is challenging  thought  provoking  and heartbreaking  and it actually requires the audience to meet it on it  s own terms . taking that into consideration  it is definitely not a movie for mindless entertainment . director john berry wisely does not attempt to dress  up athol fugard  s play . sure  we  re given a few fractured flashbacks and some breathtaking scenic shots  but the film version of boesman and lena remains  on the whole  a story of two people living in inhumane conditions .  br    br   stripped of their basic human rights  boesman  glover  and lena  bassett  have no one left to attack but each other . a third character joins them for awhile  willie jonah  amazing in a largely silent role   but the film  s focus never strays from the title characters and what they  ve become . bassett and glover give brave performances as the broken couple  performances that simply could not be improved upon . vigorously and brutally stimulating  both intellectually and emotionally  boesman and lena deserves to be rediscovered of home video . hands down  the best film of the year     .  ,1
a priest who has abandoned his ministry meets a young man who has just been ordained .  br    br   this movie is about the cruel dilemma between a life dedicated to god and faith and a life of more earthly pleasures . in post war france it is also about the mortal aspect of faith itself .  br    br   this may not be the movie of a lifetime but it is a sin to have allowed it to fall in oblivion . besides  pierre fresnay is sublime .  ,1
i  m sorry to all the fans  but this is a useless movie . the acting is bad  even wooden  it over  hypes the fright  factor early on  and doesn  t exactly work . i think there was supposed to be a twist at the end  but it just ended up being maddeningly confusing . what the hell  the dude who was killing everyone was one of the hunted  try again .  br    br   its hardly original  and it isn  t even particularly good as a straight slasher . and that  s saying something .  br    br   i think whoever did the castings  whoever wrote the script  and whoever thought of the concept should be mercilessly fired and deported .  br    br   don  t watch this movie . if someone puts this on at a party  throw the disc out the window and put on a good horror movie  like silence of the lambs or the shining .  ,0
this astonishing waste of production money is filmic proof that the rich and famous can be just as stupid and wasteful as politicians . from a  silly  play by tennessee williams and directed  with a dead hand  by joseph losey and starring taylor and burton and noel coward  this project filmed in a spectacular cliff  top mountain island mansion in the mediterranean must have seemed a sure fire winner when presented to universal in     . the result is so absurd and tedious that it almost defies belief . visually the film is spectacular but that is the force of nature that has allowed the setting and the fact that a real home is used instead of a set . the shrill antics of a screeching taylor  burton  s half asleep wanderings  the loony dialog  noel coward laughing at himself  the ridiculous story and plot devices and the absurd costuming simply irritate the viewer . boom is a disgrace  a waste of money and talent and clear proof that lauded famous people can be idiots just like the rest of the planet  s plebs . not even fun . just terrible and mad shocking waste .  ,0
when you wish for the dragon to eat every cast member  you know you  re in for a bad ride .  br    br   i went in with very  very low expectations  having read some of the other comments  and was not let down . unlike some other cheap and failed movies  however  this one doesn  t really remain hilariously  and unintentionally  funny throughout .  br    br    spoilers follow   br    br   first of all  plot it very inconsistent . looking past the  small  mistakes  such as the dragon growing up in  hours  the whole idea it  s based on is messed up . see  the movie wants us to believe that dragons came from outer space in the form of meteorites which really were dragon eggs . after explaining this  they show some peasant poking at one with his pitchfork and the dragon pops out . later  the obligatory  crazy scientist  guy babbles on about how dragons outlived the dinosaurs . so apparently humans were around when dinosaurs were  or we just have a fine little plot hole here . the other major thing is that the lab is blown up with a force  half as strong  as what was used for hiroshima . then two guys later walk in to check everything out  and it  s almost unscathed  there  s even another dragon  which grew out of who knows what . all in all it  s very predictable . as soon as the guy mentioned cloning  i guessed they  d clone a dragon . that means that our mr . smarty  pants security guy isn  t so intuitive and smart as the movie would have you believe  if you ignore that i knew this film would be about  you know  dragons .  br    br   putting that aside  the second worst thing is the  special effects .  others have mentioned the fake rocks falling during the beginning  the cg helicopter  and the dragon . it looks a bit better than a blob  but it ruined whatever it had going for it when it trudged down the hall in the same manner time after time . to their credit  the flying dragons in the beginning looked ok from far away  although the one in the cave is probably the worst one in the whole movie .  these things are funny to watch  however . the scenes where a million different shots of the same person facing different ways are shown are not . nor are the  introduction  screens with the vital stats .  br    br   coming to the actors  they weren  t the greatest  but i guess at least they tried  they seemed more enthusiastic about what they were doing than many of the actors participating in the recent  bloodrayne   for example  and you  ve got to give them points for that . one thing i noticed though was that the woman who plays meredith often had her face covered in make  up that was many tones lighter than the rest of her . she looked like she had a bad run  in with some white  face .  br    br   the script is bad and cheesy . you don  t really notice the music  but it  s actually not too bad for the most part .  br    br   the bottom line is don  t watch it unless you want to see it because you hear it  s bad  like i did   although the only funny things are the bad cg effects . other than that  don  t waste your time and money .  ,0
this is one of the weirder movies i have recently watched . that  s because it seems less like a movie and more like an experimental film . kurasawa  s experiment was to take a variety of individuals who live at a garbage dump and weave their experiences into a tapestry that offers glimpses of their generally harsh existences . not every episode is depressing and harsh  but overall this is definitely the tone . let  s see  . . . we have a case of incest  rape  attempted murder  wife swapping  alcoholism  infidelity  death of a little boy after eating tainted fish  a man with severe depression  he never talks during the movie and looks very scary   a hopeless dreamer who would probably be diagnosed with schizophrenia  a mentally retarded young man who thinks he is a street car conductor and spends all his waking moments  driving  his street car through paths among the garbage piles  a man married to a total shrew  i think i liked her character even less than the incestuous rapist    etc .  etc . in fact  it is depressing enough that it seemed almost like an ingmar bergman movie set in japan  as bergman made many movies that tended to deal with mental illness and the hopelessness of life . is it any wonder that after making this film kurasawa tried to kill himself   so  did i like it  no . it was not a fun experience . but  it was a very well  made movie that definitely kept my attention and as a result  i really wanted to see what happened to these people . it was sort of like watching a train wreck   you don  t want to see all the carnage but you can  t help but watch  of all the vignettes  i think that the older man who tended to look out for everyone and who didn  t really seem to fit in  he was too well  adjusted and wise to be living in a garbage dump  was perhaps meant to represent kurasawa himself . maybe . i dunno .  br    br   if you  ve seen a variety of kurasawa films and have a high tolerance for strange art films  give this one a watch . however  do not make this your first experience watching his movies   it  s sure to scare away many viewers   ,1
in      a group of raf officers  including eric wiiliams  decide to escape from a pow camp using a gymnastic vaulting horse in the courtyard . in      it was decided to film his account  and it kick  started a peculiar british film genre  the military prison camp story that reached its apogee in danger within       .  br    br   the wooden horse is one of the quietest films i have ever watched . there are no great dramatic moments  but a steady storyline eventually builds to a climax that has more tension because the story doesn  t give way for unlikely drama  jump cuts or jacked up  somethings about to happen   music . it is utterly of its time and works beautifully .  br    br   leo glenn  anthony steel and david tomlinson lead a curiously low key cast of extras and  i suspect  non  actors . without exception  all are constantly mono  tonal and quiet . they keep emotion out of their roles . as so many were  until recently  ex  service  i suspect they recreated their war time roles as  officers and gentlemen  .  br    br   this unemotional approach does not detract from any dramatic tension . on the contrary  unlike most wartime escape films  the story doesn  t end at the barbed wire and that fact alone keeps me glued to the end .  ,1
it is no surprise that writer  director michael powell considered  a matter of life and death   his and emeric pressburger  s spellbinding fantasy from     to be his favourite of their films together . released during the aftermath of world war   this colourful romantic adventure would have provided just the tonic for a traumatised  recovering nation in need of a good uplift .  br    br   following a string of other patriotic war films   the archers  made this one their quirkiest  skittish and most patriotic of the lot . quintessentially british for upholding british heritage  shakespeare  beer  fair play  good manners   it is also visibly americanised in its baroque compositions  technical inventiveness and a fine multi  ethnic cast .  br    br   oddly echoing another     classic   it  s a wonderful life   amolad opens on a grand firmament  with one of those jolly voice  overs preaching about the earth and the heavens  and what a big  wonderful world we live in .  br    br   it then cuts to the inside of a british cockpit  badly hit  up in flames and with the co  pilot already dead . it sounds misconceived  but the connection is soon made lucid with the events that follow .  br    br   clocking in at nearly  minutes  the rapid  fire exchange between british pilot peter  david niven  and american radio contact june  kim hunter  is breathtaking in its intimacy . resigned to dying  peter nevertheless exhausts plenty of vigour  charm and outpouring confessions  and his warm affiliation with june closes with a mutual exchange of  i love you .   br    br   keeping with the magic of the moment  peter  by oversight of his conductor   whose job it was to transport him to the  other world   escapes death and finds himself stranded on a beach . he later encounters june riding a bicycle  and instantly matches the body with the voice .  br    br   but realising their error  the high court want peter sent back  and order the french conductor  maurice goring  down to earth to retrieve him . but peter is adamant to live because of june and the conductor  s mistake  and wilfully guards his corner .  br    br   peter  s fate ultimately lies with the heavenly court and american prosecutor  raymond massey   whose jury consists of several deceased war heroes and posh british delegates . the surreal trial  which dissolves from b  w back into rich technicolor  once the verdict is announced  may well be a dream  but the final shot in the hospital validates the predictable outcome .  br    br   the abstract  frame filling  stairway to heaven   the american title of the film  is used twice the first time in b  w  when it elevates peter and his enigmatic french guardian upwards  crossing giant statues of peter  s potential attorneys for the trial  including abraham lincoln and plato . the second time  the softly lit colour stairway provides the setting for what is an iconic image in cinema  peter and june frozen side  by  side  their marvelled eyes fixed forward in the frame  their fate sealed .  br    br   the unlikely affection shared between peter and june never turns mushy or verbose it  s treated with nobility and the perception that the couple are already suitable enough to be married and simply need to convince people of their love  so it can keep them together .  br    br   the french conductor  who can freeze time and people  s bodies  obtrudes many of their key moments together  lecturing peter about history and among his mischievous tricks  pinching peter  s  top    game tricks  book and his coffee cup .  br    br   as visually inspired as other powell  pressburger collaborations  this was the first time they combined colour with b  w  the latter having a cheerful quality when used for the heaven scenes  and both are equally captivating .  br    br   the outstanding script more than matches the imaginative set design  with dialogue that sounds so immediate that is doesn  t feel like it was written or performed for the screen . amusing and witty  powell  pressburger  s writing deserves equal acclamation with their forte for colour and composition .  br    br   made in       a matter of life and death  is one of those films that defies it age  looking fresh and inventive  even in this age where cgi would vamp up its artificial effects  probably stripping them of their emotional wonder .  br    br   other jarring changes would include the need for reduced average seconds for cutting and the inevitable plea to shorten dialogue so it can preserve the low attention spans of most audiences . powell weaves a spell that subconsciously absorbs the viewer from the first frame  giving him freedom to experiment with images without betraying the logical development of peter  s predicament .  ,1
this was a disappointing film . the people seem to have no substance  the lead protagonist martin cahil has zero redemptive values  in fact everyone in it including jon voight epitomizes sleeze . i would not recommend this film to anyone . the violence is distasteful  though artfully done . the filming is to black  at least the print i saw fit this category . a disappointment .  ,0
spoilers spoilers  br    br   this movie   the divers   is really interesting . all i roughly knew about it was that it would involve nazi history  underwater scenes and everybody would be speaking danish . but i decided to check it out for one reason  the fact that the story evolves around a sunken wwii german submarine . i  ve got a fetish for german subs  especially wrecks that can be dived upon . so i was a bit sceptical about the danish part  but reasoned that the sub could weigh up that part . knowing that nordic films aren  t always that good and not sure of the budget size i was  to say the least  very sceptical .  br    br   upon viewing i was . . . surprised .  br    br   i had some thoughts on the actors being inadequate  seeing how some are very young  the two main actors in particular . this was not an issue  they both perform very well . as do the other actors  who mostly consist of people in their    s and beyond . this makes for some interesting interaction between young and old  not often seen on the screen . not unique in anyway  but somewhat rare . and it  s all good .  br    br   as for the danish language  it is nearly impossible to understand . but this was no problem  it had subtitles .  br    br   another issue was the submarine itself  i suspected there would be interior shots as well as underwater exterior shots of the submarine . having decided their budget was slim  i thought this could turn out adequate at the best and down right awful at it  s worst . again i was surprised  the exterior scenes of the wreck are beautiful and the interior scenes are very realistic . having a fetish for german subs  i knew what the sub should look like  especially inside  and was not let down . the team has done some serious research . it  s all good .  br    br   i suspect more people than myself will watch this movie just to see some sub wreck scenes so i feel i must issue a  warning  . the submarine in the movie is not an actual model that existed during the war . it  s a special purpose sub . but to give you a hint of what to expect  it  s a crossing between a type vii  type ix and a japanese transport sub similar to i    . it  s god a good design and makes a nice wreck .  br    br   the setting is on a danish island or peninsula  i can  t remember . it  s summertime and two brothers travel to their grandfather to celebrate the coming of summer as they do every year . their grandfather is a mariner of sorts . the cinematography is quite nice  a lot of pretty summer scenes at the island docks  some newfound teenage love  nice diving weather and a general feeling of  perfect  . once again  it  s all good .  br    br   plot  wise the island gets some visitors of the suspect kind  a gathering of men hire one of the boats  an old minesweeper and it  s crew . one of the visitors  a man in his    s  has the german eagle and swastika tattooed on his back . the island  s senior citizens all remember when a german u  boat was sunk towards the end of world war ii and ever since then there have been rumors of nazi gold in the depths . the grandfather was one of the young men who searched for the sunken u  boat shortly after german bodies started floating ashore back in     . no submarine was ever found .  br    br   what to expect  br    br   key elements are nazi experiments  nazi history  treasure hunting  secrecy  competition  teen love  conspiracy  and . . . a surprise .  br    br    warning  spoiler   br    br   i had not expected some elements of the supernatural to appear in this movie and it caught me off guard . not being a big fan of supernatural events  it nevertheless fitted well into the story and poses no problem . it  s not like  from dusk til dawn  where everybody turns into vampires towards the end . this is a bit more subtle .  br    br   overall  really good movie  i gave it an  . some due to the fact that it isn  t a hollywood movie with unlimited resources . i later learned that it had a fair budget and that some of the actors were seasoned danish veterans . but even if this had been a hollywood production  i would give it a  or  . definately worth your while . yes  a child  s story in a way  but then again a mature tale . it has a lot of suspense and a grand aura of adventure  which i found very appealing . and  again  the cinematography is really nice .  br    br    medusa      br    br    ,1
the primary aspect of this film which most people miss is that luhzin lives his life as a chess game . so many people have seen this film and just don  t get it  and i don  t understand why . while watching this film i was taken on a private journey which floored me . i will try to explain this without any spoilers  but be forewarned  i do talk about things that happen in the movie .  br    br    possible spoilers  be forewarned    br    br   his is a life of  large moves  versus  small moves  . he chooses natalia to be his queen  and he and she behave as his aunt first described the king and queen and their moves when she introduced him to chess as a boy . listen closely to that description .  br    br   when someone asks him a question  he flashbacks to the past as if reviewing past moves .  the flashbacks are beautifully lit  by the way .  the flashbacks are quite interesting as well  for they give not only his point of view as a child  but the point of view of the other character as well . it  s stunning .  br    br   various characters become either his helpers or his enemies  pawns  bishops and knights  their actions enlightening you as to who  s side they are on . even their placement in a scene is pivotal to understanding what is going on . beautifully done .  br    br   i will not comment more on what happens to the character of luhzin  but i hope that this will illuminate what is actually happening at the end .  br    br   this film is constantly working on many levels  which is why i endorse it . it was a treat and a joy to watch .  br    br   if you like this film i would recommend a film called fresh . the only way that these films are similar is the use of chess and the characters being treated as pieces .  br    br    ,1
wow what a great premise for a film  set it around a film maker with writers block who decides to take up tango lessons . hey and what an even better idea cast the central role to a film maker whos interested in tango . gosh i wish i had that knack for genius . yes im being sarcastic .  br    br   it amazes me that these type of zero potential for making money movies are made . come on unless youre a rabid tango fan  i do concede they do exist judging by the comments  or a die hard member of the sally potter fan club    theres nothing in this film that will make you rush off to the cinema to see it . even if youre into tango much of the film is taken up with meaningless scenes like a house getting renovated or a man in wheelchair going along a road  br    br   coming soon the review lesson where a failed screenwriter from scotland sits in front of a computer writing very sarcastic but highly entertaining reviews of films hes seen . gasp in shock as theo robertson puts the boot into the latest hollywood blockbusters  weep in sympathy as he gets yet another rejection letter from a film company  fall in lust as he takes a bath and rubs soap over his well toned body . the review lesson coming soon to a cinema near you if anyone is stupid enough to fund the movie  br    br   ps sally potter is unrelated to harry potter  ,0
the end of violence and certainly the million dollar hotel hinted at the idea the wenders has lost his vision  his ability to tell compelling stories through a map of the moving picture . the land of plenty seals the coffin  i  m afraid  by being a vastly unimaginative  obviously sentimental and clich  d film . the characters are entirely flat and stereotyped  the writing  plot and direction are amateurish  at best . for the first time in quite a while  i was impatient for the film to end so i could get on with my life . the war  torn delirium of the uncle  the patriotic abstract gazing at the sky at the conclusion . . . it all just struck me as being so simple and pathetic  hardly the work of a filmmaker who once made some compelling magic on screen . what happened  the days of experimentation  perceptive writing and interesting filming possibilities are long behind him  i  m afraid . let  s hope he finds his inspiration again . . . at the toronto film festival  which is where i saw the film  wenders was there to introduce it . completely lacking in humility  he offered us the following  i hope . . . no  wait . . . i know you  re going to enjoy the next two hours .  i  m afraid he couldn  t be more wrong . . .  ,0
personally  i enjoyed cut thouroughly . it was the first time i  ve seen a theatrically release australian slasher flick . a genre normally restricted to the mainstream hollywood films .  br    br   with all the usual cooky comedies and dramas coming out of australia i loved being able to see a homegrown horror movie that wasn  t a rip off of anything . i didn  t even think it was really a spoof of other movies . it was a supernaturally theme horror like nightmare on elm street  not scream or i know what you did last summer and therefore there was more of a suspension of disbelief . i think it  s about time australian films tried to get more into the mainstream genres .  br    br   cut was original  scary enough and ultimately just a bit of fun . i  d give it seven out of ten and wouldn  t treat it as anything serious . it did what i expected it to do  entertain and scare me enough times to be satisfying . i enjoyed it .  ,1
i  m rather surprised that no reviewer so far has commented on the rather elementary chess blunder in luzhin  s game as white against an unnamed opponent immediately before the final . despite the use of jonathan speelman as consultant chess expert  luzhin is shown winning the game with an illegal move . in between the rapid cuts away and back to the board it is not hard to spot that after luzhin  s combination culminating in a queen sacrifice  his rook on d  is still pinned by black  s rook at c  against his king in the corner at h  . thus he is unable to play the purported mating move rd   d  which would be illegal  but he  s shown doing so to rapturous applause from the audience .  ,1
canadian director vincenzo natali took the art  house circuit by storm with the intriguing and astonishingly intelligent cube  which is my personal favourite sf film of the   s . it framed the basic conceit of a group of strangers trapped in a maze shaped like a giant cube  shot entirely on one set  and took this idea in fascinating directions .  br    br   i  ve been eagerly awaiting natali  s follow  up  and although its taken five years for him to mount another project  i  m delighted to say it was worth the wait . cypher is a fascinating exploration of one man  s place in the world  and how through a completely logical chain of events  finds himself in a situation beyond his control .  br    br   i don  t want to reveal too much about the plot  because one of the joys of cypher is the different avenues it takes us down . it is so refreshing in this day and age to see a sf film that has more than one idea in it  s head . cypher is such a film .  br    br   morgan sullivan  jeremy northam   one of the blandest people to ever walk the planet  is hired by the company digicorp . they send him to different parts of america to record different seminars . to his bewilderment  they are unbelievably boring . covering topics as mundane as shaving cream and cheese .  br    br   while morgan is waiting for one seminar  he runs into rita foster  an impeccably cast lucy liu   the definition of an ice maiden . she gives him the brush  off  but there is something to her he finds irresistible . that  s not too surprising considering the dry marriage he is in .  br    br   when rita turns up at another one of morgan  s seminars  she tells him his life is not what it appears . and i  m not saying anything more about the plot . to do so would cheapen the impact the rest of the film has on us  as well as the tortuous path that  s so much fun to follow .  br    br   as with cube  natali shows quite a talent for encompassing seemingly ordinary people  taking them out of the familiar  and basically seeing what will happen when they  re thrust into the unknown . and cypher follows similar patterns . but it  s not a carbon copy of cube . it has it  s own inspiration .  br    br   cypher is a film that has more in common with conspiracy thrillers and paranoia stories . one of the great things about cypher is the way these themes creep into the story without your knowledge . when morgan realises his false identity is a piece of a much larger puzzle  it  s as much of a shock to us as it is to him .  br    br   one thing that distinguishes cypher from cube is how much more polished it is . where cube was confined to a minimalist setting and a shoestring budget with a cast of unknowns  cypher is also on a low budget  but natali economises it as much as he can  allowing him to broaden the horizon  and launching morgan on an amazing journey through the labyrinth of his own identity .  br    br   natali  s direction is exceptional  with a deft hand on the reins . there are some amazing camera angles from above  such as the enormity of the digicorp building as a vast  robust office block in conjunction to the insignificant speck that is morgan standing outside . all the colour appears to have been bled out of the picture  which compliments the tone of the film perfectly as a modern day film  noir .  br    br   the acting is uniformly excellent throughout . jeremy northam is a sympathetic figure from his loveless marriage to questioning his own identity . his performance is excellent because it  s so modulated . he literally seems to transform right before our very eyes . from a clinical  spineless wimp to a confident man who will do anything to preserve his new identity .  br    br   david hewlett puts in a welcome appearance who made such an impact in cube . he resides in a secret silo that looks like it was borrowed from men in black . his scene is one of the best because it  s an exercise in carefully calculated suspense and paranoia . he is a supposed expert in identifying double  agents  and it  s a fantastic piece of writing  brilliantly acted by hewlett . all he has to do is look at morgan  and we  re drawn into his complex mind game .  br    br   but it  s lucy liu who  s the scene stealer here . too often she is cast in films where her potential is not utilised to full effect . but in cypher  she is finally given a character that fits her like a glove . rita is an aloof  guarded femme fatale that liu inhabits with relish . i perked up every time she appeared because she is always in control  and can reduce a room to silence by the power of her icy stare alone .  br    br   things come to a very gratifying end  that doesn  t conclude on an ambiguous note the way cube did . but morgan deserves his happy ending . after he  s been put through the ringer like this  i cheered for him in the final scene . it  s a perfect final moment because it comes as a ray of sunshine after a gloomy   minutes .  br    br   cypher succeeds on all counts . engaging  shocking  always entertaining  it  s everything that total recall wanted to be but wasn  t . and it comes as a refreshing antidote to the overwhelming and inexplicable matrix .  br    br   a fine follow  up from natali . and now i  m a committed fan of the man . superb stuff   ,1
i  ll be blunt . i  m not one for politically correct movies where the woman plays the bad ass who  s not going to take any crap from anyone . if any one of the cast members wanted to  they could have just taken her out in a heartbeat . it was entertaining on mst  k  but don  t rent the real version . trust me . have i ever lied to you   ,0
i was one of those  few americans  that grew up with all of gerry andersen  s marvelous creations . thunderbirds was a great series for the time and would have made a great action  adventure movie if only the writers could have figured out where to target it .  br    br   i expected it to be a romp  but i did not expect it to aim at such a low age group . like lost in space  this could have been both visually stunning and exciting . it should have focused on more action  adventure and the goal of the original series . . . saving people in trouble .  br    br   instead  it focused on alan saving the day instead of his brothers  who were cast too young anyway vs . the original  . the breakout part was lady penelope and parker . i didn  t care too much for the characters in the original  but i was grateful for them in the movie . they stole the show   br    br   i always enjoyed thunderbirds more for the high  tech than the stories  and even that did not get enough screen time as far as i was concerned . i would have enjoyed seeing more of the cool gadgets .  br    br   but then  i  m just a big kid . . .    ,0
words cannot begin to describe how blandly terrible this movie is . i wish it were  so bad it  s good   but it  s not . it  s just dull  lifeless  and boring . it  s so bad i couldn  t even laugh at it .  br    br   in response to other posters  anne  marie frigon is not the highlight of the movie . the only person less charismatic is the director brett kelly  who as a true statement on vanity  cast himself as the male lead . they both look like inbreeds  sister and brother .  br    br   the gal  sherry thurig  is a looker . the complete opposite of anne  marie  attractive . this girl is tall and willowy  and can act . although you can tell she  s holding back .  br    br   all the actors seem to be holding back  especially the supporting male  mark . i  ve seen less wood in a rain forest  but he  s still better than kelly . why would kelly keep his actors from acting  is he really that bad a director  everyone else has summed the story up perfectly  there isn  t one . kids are kidnapped and kelly steps in poo to solve the crime . i know how he felt stepping in the poo  it  s how i felt after watching his movie .  br    br   yes  i tried to get my money back from the rental store . this is a home movie best left to be seen by the friends of the director  and if you search them out  you  ll see those same friends were the one who gave the movie positive marks  .  ,0
i typically don  t like reality shows  particularly the ones that are profiting off of  american idol   s success . but this one i can live with .  br    br   comedians from all around the world perform a brief routine for celebrity talent scouts  and if they like them  those guys will be sent to perform a routine for an actual audience . then ten or twelve comics are selected to live in a house together and do  survivor  style competitions using comedic tactics . then one will be determined as  last comic standing .  i do like stand up comedy  so this is the one reality show must keen to my interests . there are usually some pretty funny comics selected through . it started the careers of such talents as alonzo bodden  ralphie may  and josh blue .  br    br   my negative criticisms is the fact that there is the possibility that a lot of these comics were selected for their contribution to reality show drama . at first they lived together in a house like  big brother   but now they  ve done away with that  thank god .  br    br   and there are a lot of comedians i felt  were only chosen not because they  re funny  but because of race  ethnicity  attitude  sex  etc . when other comics clearly should  ve beaten them out . but overall  it  s a well  made reality show  which are two terms up until now i thought were an oxymoron .  ,1

probably encouraged by admirers of her much  better  orlando   potter here delivers a vehicle for herself in the worst way she writes  directs  stars  and actually co  writes the music  including a mawkish love song . the film strongly resembles a high school or college project by a teenager convinced that her own intimate loves and melodramatic obsessions are as fascinating to us as to her . but potter  s character is as unsympathetic as the object of her romantic obsession is unlikable  and the whole film is an embarrassing display of narcissism masquerading as a celebration of the tango . perhaps if she hadn  t cast herself it might have worked . she just can  t act  whether playing herself or not . pretentious  over  ambitious  dull  and silly .  ,0
this is the worst piece of crap i have seen recently . there is nothing good about this movie . the plot is plain stupid  dialogs don  t make any sense  humorous scenes never heard anything about the real humor . actors just don  t play  the worse they don  t even try . the script itself is somewhat which is in the same league with ed wood and uwe boll . there is only one good thing in this flick  the fights . they are well choreographed as one would expect of the hong kong guys  and are the only reason to watch prince of the sun . although i believe the fights are just supposed to fill the empty space so that the screenwriter didn  t have to bother thinking about the storyline . however  this weak and absurd plot may prevent you from watching it to the end . avoid it unless you are fan of the dragon lady cynthia rothrock .  ,0
i  m biased towards any movie that paints a luxuriant picture of italy  in my opinion the most romantic country in the world . unfortunately the movie was rather short  unusually so for a period piece  and a little sparse on the cinematography aspect . however  the excellent story makes up for it . the four ladies embark on a much  needed relaxing vacation with problems on their minds . over the course of the movie  they realize their problems and begin fixing them . they believe san salvatore  the castle they stay in  has an enchanting effect on people .  it  s a tub of love   says lottie wilkins . you can watch their gradual change from dissatisfied to exuberant as the italian seaside works its magic on them .  br    br   all their problems and their solutions are plausible . the actresses were great . the background music seemed very appropriate for an romantic italian locale . all in all  a      movie for me .  ,1
this is a film i saw when it first came out  and which i have seen a few more times over the years . it  s always enjoyable .  br    br   one thing is that the comedy does not take sides it skewers labor and capitalists equally . only sid seems outside the classic struggle  even though he  s responsible for it .  br    br   spoiler warning do not read further if you haven  t seen the film  br    br   this is a fantasy  though presented fairly plausibly . ask yourself could someone support most of his or her weight in a single strand of fabric  it would cut through almost any support .  br    br   also  when cornered in an alley  sid uses a garbage can cover like a knight  s shield . cute symbolism .  br    br   someday  i  ll get this on dvd .  ,1
hello i am from denmark  and one day i was having a film evening with my friends . one brought this movie with him  russian terminator  and it was extremely awful . after watching less than half a minute we decided to fast forward only stopping at some laughable  highlights  or should i say  lowlights  in the movie . i was actually mostly surprised to find out that this film was produced here in my homeland denmark . . . that must have been the biggest mistake this country ever made .  ,0
an idiotic dentist finds out that his wife has been unfaithful . so  no new story lines here . however  the authors managed to create a stupid  disgusting film . if you enjoy watching kids vomiting  or seeing a dentist imagining that he is pulling all his wife  s teeth out in a bloody horror  type  go see  or rent  the film . if not  move on to something else  my fair lady  anyone    ,0
i don  t have words to describe how good this movie is . only a genius like amrita pritam could have written such a real depiction of the days of partition . the movie kept haunting me for many days .  br    br   urmila did the role of her life in this movie . she put life in the role of puroo and manoj vajpai did no less in his role as rashid . it is hard to imagine anyone other than these two doing the role of puroo and rashid . the punjabi costumes looked so natural on urmila and manoj looked like a natural punjabi mussalmaan .  br    br   sandhali sinha as lajjo and suri as ramchand did fabulous job . priyanshu chattarjee did good work as triloki .  br    br   some of the scenes you just can  t get out of your mind . when puroo meets lajjo for the first time  it brings tears to your eyes . the climax is just killer . i was expecting a tragic ending but thankfully  the ending was wonderful .  br    br   this movie is in the same category as pakeezah  mughal  e  azam  banaras etc . not to be missed .  ,1
i thought this was an awesome movie . the theme song is sweet    anyway  the only thing that somewhat bothered me was in the beginning  when everything should have been normal . it was very weird and unrealistic . the big cable company is mainly what i  m talking about . apart from that  the movie was very creative . i think that all the acting was well done  the actors acted out their characters  personalities perfectly . everything fit together well . it really is a shame that their isn  t a soundtrack . that would have been great  because this is a canadian film  and because it is one of my favorites  i give this movie a   out of     ,1
i happened on  shower  in the foreign film section of my local video store and passed it over several times since from its cover it looked like a farce or comedy . i then lucked into a copy to purchase at economical price and am happy for my luck .  shower  is the story of three    men  a father and two    adult sons  each coming to terms with life changes as the world around them also continues to change in modern china . as with many  foreign  films  the chinese culture itself is one of the most interesting facets of this movie .  br    br   beyond the fascinating characteristics of the local  chinese color giving the setting to this story  is the difficult yet touching relationships between the men and a sole woman involved in the story  all set against the backdrop of a village bathhouse .  br    br   the family  s story moves from estrangement to understanding and made me glad i came to know these people . added to the main story are the numerous small characters  bathhouse customers  and their individual conflicts and friendships .  shower  is a film one walks away from smiling and touched by its warmth and humanity .  ,1
this game is amazing . really  you should get it if you don  t have it . although it is ancient now it was amazing when it came out . i believe that this game will always be a classic . it  s just as good a super mario world or so . when i was young  my friend and i would sit and play this game for hours trying to beat it which we eventually did . it  s not nearly as advanced as super mario galaxy  but if you are a fellow mario fan it is essential . it  s fun entertaining and challenging . everything you could want out of a fantasy game except for good graphics   well it did come out in     .  rock on  eva mario luigi and yoshi    nintendo is the best   ,1
could this be by the same director as don  t look now or bad timing  poorly  br    br   acted  clunkily edited . you only have to compare the various accident scenes in this with similar ones in don  t look now to see how much roeg has lost his  br    br   touch .  br    br   even the generally reliable teresa russell  looking a bit chunky these days  i  m afraid to report  cannot save this one . the plot is pure pseudo  religious hokum  the acting is wooden and roeg  s attempts at his trademark dislocation of time are pitiful .  br    br   avoid this one like the plague .  ,0
in all honesty  this series is as much a classic  as television goes  as the original poem is to the world  s literature . far from being crassly exploitative  it is a beautiful and respectful rendering of one of the western culture  s defining texts .  br    br   i was moved by the plight of odysseus and his followers touched by the drama of the fall of troy  which was felt but not seen   intrigued by the way the gods played with the fate of mortals .  it should be mentioned that the gods appearing here are not ridiculous cgi creatures flitting around on their ankle wings  or poorly  cast fashion models in bikinis . as in homer  s work  they act through mortal agents or  rarely  are represented by classical statuary  .  br    br   it  s a pity it  s not available in dvd  especially given the vastly inferior and cheesy adaptations of the odyssey that one can find in video stores .  ,1
personally i would advise people to stay clear of this movie . it  s on the whole a bore to watch and the fighting is poorly choreographed . slow and not very convincing . if you buy the hong kong legends dvd release of this movie  then the only thing worth listening to is the bey logan audio commentary .  br    br   but in any case  since when has there ever been a ninja film worth watching . i cannot think of one and frankly do not wish to .  br    br   overall  when it comes to movies  i have one golden rule avoid any films that contains the word  ninja  .  ,0
one stinko of a movie featuring a shopworn plot and  to be kind  acting of less than oscar caliber . but to me the single worst flaw was the total misrepresentation of a jet aircraft  and especially a    . some of the major blunders  br    br    . no flight engineer  or even a flight engineer station .  . mis  identifying the f    interceptors as f     s  no resmblance whatsoever  .  . loading passengers into an  aft baggage compartment  supposedly accesible from the cabin  even if such a compartment existed  placing that much weight that far aft would make the aircraft unflyable .  . hollow point bullets that  won  t damage the aircraft  .  . the entire landing procedure was so bad i wanted to puke .  . an sr     of all planes  with a pressure seal hatch  . opening a cabin door outward  into the wind  in flight    br    br   ah nuts  it was just a truly lousy movie . gotta make the list of bottom   of the year .  ,0
pieced  edited  together from dead body parts  deleted scenes  from corpses  anchorman   the frankenstein monster  wake up  ron burgundy  is definitely not a sight for sore eyes  something you  d ever want to watch twice . . . . . maybe even once for that matter .   br    br   more often than not  the relativity of the scenes in wurb are made relevant by a third person narrator . even more troubling is that the characters in wurb are inconsistent with the versions of themselves that we had at the end of anchorman  in opening narration we  re told wurb takes place shortly after the original .  at the end of anchorman  burgundy had grown since the start of the film and embraced having a hybrid co  anchorwoman  lover . in this film  he  s back to his immature antics with prank phone calls to veronica  quite clearly these are the more of the same scenes from the original anchorman spliced in to wurb .   br    br   the part that makes this a movie  a continually evolving story  involves a bank  robbing clan without a cause called the alarm clock . these scenes are almost painful to sit through . this part was scrapped from the original scripts for anchorman .  br    br   the majority of other scenes involving our channel  news team are clearly alternate  deleted takes on scenes from anchorman . they go to the same party as in the original  the same original  group bitching about having a woman on the team  scene  and the same cat fashion show segment that veronica had objections to reporting .  br    br   burgundy re  creates their first date with the drive  in spot overlooking san diego and dinner at his favorite club  tinos . neither character make mention that they  ve been to the drive  in spot before and when burgundy walks into tinos with veronica  he introduces it to her as though they  ve never been before . oh  and they  re wearing the same clothes as on their original date .  br    br   still  i have to give some credit to the filmmakers  even if wurb is nothing more than a clever way of presenting deleted scenes tied together with narration . between the two ron burgundy stories  this is the weaker one . looking back on it  it  s quite a feat for anchorman to have risen from the ashes of wurb . you stay classy  imdb . thanks for stopping by .  ,0
i don  t know why  but for some sick reason  i think since i  ve been on the disney sequel binge  i decided to just go ahead and see    dalmations . the first movie that was a remake of the disney cartoon classic starring glenn close as cruella de vil  it seemed like a sure hit  but it was just a bomb . i think the reason why these movies don  t work is because    dalmations  the original  was a cartoon  it just worked better and was more appealing to the kids as well as adults . this was not really that fun because it  s adults running around trying to act like cartoons instead of just actual human beings  i understand they  re trying to make sure that it  s appealing to the kids  but it  s ridicules to see the way these actors are behaving in the film . and    dalmations  s story isn  t really that good .  br    br   cruella de vil has been in prison for a while  but things change when she is proved that she now loves animals and is a pleasant human being . but her reputation is now damaged as a puppy  napper  but she buys a man  s dog shelter and is all of a sudden is being loved by everyone and it looks like she  s changed . but when she sees her probation officer  s dalmatians  she goes crazy and starts seeing spots  and she looses it . she  s back for revenge on puppies and is still determined to get that dalmation coat she  s always wanted .  br    br   glenn close is such an amazing actress  very under rated  but her taking on cruella de vil  she  s good  but let  s face it  this movie made the fun villain just more of a silly nut case . also  as cute as the puppies were  it just works more for the animation  it sounds stupid  but it  s just not as believable without the cartoon and their personalities being in the mix . i wouldn  t really recommend    dalmations  it  s alright  but if you agree that the first movie was just a waste of time  this is just the same thing .  br    br        ,0
you do realize that you  ve been watching the exact same show for eight years  right  i could understand the initial curiosity of seeing strangers co  exist on an island  but you  d think that after watching unkempt  stink  ladened heroes run roughshod through the bush with an egg on a spoon for half a decade would be enough to get you to commit to something a little more original  and interesting  .  br    br   and i  m not even speaking of the shows validity which for the record i find questionable . it  s just hard to suspend disbelief for  bushy bill  eating a rat when the entire crew of producers and camera people are housed in an air conditioned make  shift bio  dome sipping frosty mochcinno  s with moxy .  br    br   what  s the appeal here  i don  t care about these people or their meandering lives . i just don  t get it . but if you do find yourself being captivated by hairy  unwashed people  i suggest you turn off your tv and just take a trip to your local bus station where you can see people like this in their true habitat . they call them homeless people  and free of charge  you can sit back and marvel in their uncanny ability to retrieve various cigarette debris from a plethora of garbage canisters  eventually striking  pay  dirt  and fashioning a homemade dr . frankenstein  styled cancer  stick  all the while begging people for change for food when the stink of  aqua velva  on their breath is enough to suggest otherwise . and the best part  much like survivor  every week one member of the tribe  leaves  the  island  when they are unceremoniously sent packing to the local institution when the frightening unmedicated state of full  blown schizophrenia kicks into gear  now that  s entertainment   ,0
  br    br   film dominated by raven  haired barbara steele  it was seen when i was seven or eight and created permanent images of pallid vampiric men and women stalking a castle  seeking blood . steele is an icon of horror films and an otherworldly beauty  and the views of the walking dead pre  date romero  s night of the living dead shamblers  unifying them in my mind .  br    br   i don  t see the connection between this film and the haunting  which is clever but ambiguous about the forces present . la danza macabre is a b  movie without pretention  daring you to fall in love with barbara steele and suffer the consequences . there  s no such draw to haunting  s overwrought claire bloom . the comparisons to the haunting are superficial .  br    br   and no  this movie does not need to be remade . not only is it a product of the sixties  but the large percentage of talentless cretins in hollywood cannot fathom macabre  s formula for terror . that formula is based on one overriding factor good writing . low  grade classics like castle and corman  s poe films with r . matheson and tourneur  s out of the past share a commonality of strong writing . it  s simple . get a real writer like richard matheson or steve mcquarrie and let them put a plot into today  s cinematic mess . besides that  let hollywood attempt some original material for a change  and stop exploiting the obviously superior product of the past .  ,1
the dancing was probably the only watchable thing about this film   and even that was disappointing compared to some other films . my gawd   br    br   to me  this is the worst kind of film   one that assumes it  s a work of art because it has all the trappings of film  as  art . yes  it  s beautifully photographed  but ultimately lacks the depth and tension of the dance around which the film supposedly surrounds itself . tango is a tease  it  s hot  it has drama  it  s audacious   precisely what this film is not .  ,0
the photography was beautiful but i had difficulty understanding what was happening . . . was there a lot of symbolism  . . . the  goldfishes  do they mean something in thai culture  there  s not much plot  not much happens and it just meanders along . no real start  no real middle and no real end . rather unsatisfying really .  br    br   it was difficult to get into the characters as you never felt you got to know them . . . it was difficult to know which scenes were imaginary and which were real . the move felt chaotic and disjointed . i don  t know what the pang brothers were hoping to achieve . maybe if i were thai it would make more sense . . .  ,1
in reflecting on this movie i can think of two others to help put it in perspective . one relatively forgettable but covering the same geography  is coup de torchon  the other thousands of miles away and much larger in scope is the unforgettable indochine . claire denis has produced a movie that has some of the grand underpinnings of indochine  the complex and unspoken relationship between france and her colonial subjects .  br    br   i was struck with the dignity of potee  with his struggle to maintain his dignity among his peers and with his white bosses . i was also struck with the love  hate relationship between him and aimee . it is the latter that gives the film its driving force  it is the latter that links this movie to indochine .  br    br   one never is sure what motivates everyone  though some of the characters are required of a remembrance of colonialism . it is this cynical side of the story that ties it to coup de torchon . theirs is the more scandalous story  perhaps even more interesting in a depraved way  but denis gives us a remembrance of how it was with all the tension and unresolved relationships .  br    br   the american black who gives the grown up france a ride in the beginning and end of the movie offers yet another interesting side to the confusion that we in the western world have when we look at africa . he says that when he came he wanted to call everyone brother . he was coming home  but they just thought him to be a little daft . france  the character and the girl  grew up in cameroon  but neither fully understands what it is even though they can remember how it was .  br    br    ,1
awwww . . . . yes  it is heartwarming and all that some unlucky family gets adopted by abc  sears and has their home  renovated .  that  s where the humanistic appeal ends . i liked it early in its run  but now this show has become disgustingly excessive .  br    br   ten needy families could be given relatively luxurious homes with lots of goodies for every one family that each episode of this show splurges on . the people at habitat for humanity must be shaking their heads in disbelief . for example  is it necessary for a healthy sixteen year old boy to have a jacuzzi in his bedroom  or have his bed tricked  out with  low rider  hydraulics  does the mom really need her dilapidated  non  running and rusted out old pick  up truck restored and  pimped  by some of the best customizers in california  a new one would have done the job quite nicely  and probably for a third of the price . do people really need a sixty  five inch plasma screen in every room of the house  and then there  s the issue of who pays the increased property taxes and utility bills . even after the zaniacs at  makeover  leave  somebody still has earn a living . i doubt the friendly folks down at social services will see the humor in all of this largess .  br    br   this show is nothing more than a ratings grabber for abc  and a tacit commercial for its sponsors .  ,0
 . . . but i regret having seen it . since the ratings on imdb are relatively high  and they must also have been relatively high on netflix   i guess i put it in my queue because it is advertised as a gentle comedy from the uk  a category that has produced many films i liked immensely .  saving grace   on the other hand  falls into the category of laugh  less comedies usually populated by hollywood movies produced and directed by the talentless . brenda blethyn is a capable actress  and i have liked her in other movies . the concept   a gardener growing marijuana to overcome the penury she finds herself confronting after her husband  s death   does not offend me . notwithstanding the strenuous efforts on the part of the cast to produce humor  the film falls flat on its face  falling flat on its arse might have been funnier  as far as i and my wife were concerned . be forewarned  oh gentle reader  not all offbeat british comedies succeed . this one is a dud .  ,0
even for the cocaine laced      s this is a pathetic . i don  t understand why someone would want to waste celluloid  time  effort  money  and audience brain cells to make such drivel . if your going to make a comedy  make it funny . if you want to film trash like this keep it to yourself . if you  re going to release it as a joke like this don  t    i mean  it was a joke right  someone please tell me this was a joke . please .  ,0
mad magazine may have a lot of crazy people working for it . . . but obviously someone there had some common sense when the powers  that  be disowned this waste of celluloid . . . the editing is el crapo  the plot is incredibly thin and stupid . . . and the only reason it gets a two out of ten is that stacy nelkin takes off some of her clothes and we get a nice chest shot . . . i never thought i would feel sorry for ralph macchio making the decision to be in this thing  but i do . . . and i really feel bad for ron leibman and tom poston  gifted actors who never should have shown up in this piece of . . . film . . . at least mr . leibman had the cajones to refuse to have his name put anywhere on the movie . . . and he comes out ahead . . . there are actually copies of this thing with mad  s beginning sequence still on it . . . if you can locate one  grab it cuz it is probably worth something . . . it  s the only thing about this movie that  s worth anything . . . and a note to the folks at imdb . com . . . there is no way to spoil this movie for anyone . . . the makers spoiled it by themselves . . .  ,0
i don  t know what it is with this movies . but movies about history or religion are always criticised by their accuracy . of course it  s not     accurate . it  s difficult to make     accurate films nowadays when even the  experts  disagree with each other . therefore i rather like to judge a movie by what it is trying to say than pick on all the inaccuracies .  br    br   so i start by saying that i liked this mini serie . but i do agree with the critique that his childhood years went by too fast . the series should have been a three part story  his childhood being the first part . but if they didn  t have more money to shoot more story who am i to criticise that     br    br   there  s only one real problem i have with this movie and that  s the fact that it  s told in a history book way . especially the second part which is just a sum of events that happened . i rather would have liked to see hitler more humane  more scenes where he doubts himself etc .  . noah taylor did that more in the movie  max  which seem to work better i think . nevertheless i  m glad this was made and own it on dvd . just to remember more vividly what happened and see carlyle giving his best .  .      ,1

i look at this page  and it seems disapproving to me to have to listen to someone ramble and rant at a real classic . sure  i agree to let everyone have their opinion  but here  s mine  br    br   this movie should not be missed by any classic horror watcher  and should be seen many casual viewers around the world . sure  it has lost some of it  s flair and greatness with age  especially in todays world of cgi effects  but that  s not why you should like it .  br    br   you should like it because it actually is a scary movie  even for today  s standards . it  s overall ickyness will creep you out just as much as the original audiences  so don  t slam a classic if you haven  t given it a chance . watch it  but not with a critical attitude . watch it to have fun  how it was originally intended .  ,1
are highlights of this     feature . the pride of the clan tells the story of a young girl who becomes clan chieftain after her father dies . on an island off the coast of scotland  the villagers live the simple lives of  fisher folk .  my copy is very dark and sometimes hard to read  but the film boasts some stunning ocean scenery  and the camera work on boats is splendid . maurice tourneur directed pickford in this pleasant film . pickford was already a major star in      and this film seems to have been written just for her plucky young woman succeeds over misfortune . pickford whip lashing lazy villagers toward church is very funny . and the final scenes on the sinking ship are very well done . not a great picford film  but still worth seeing . matt moore  pickford was married to his brother  owen moore  is the love interest  and is good as the strapping island lad . leatrice joy is one of the villagers but i couldn  t spot her either . my copy intersperses lots of bells and gongs and adds an eerie feeling when the village warning bells are rung . very effective .  ,1
i don  t watch a lot of tv  except for the office  weeds  entourage and e   s soup . i think i hold this show in good company .  br    br   i love the scathing review of pop culture that this show gives . soup also helps me stay on top of what people in the office are referring to when talking about a sanjaya or heidi montag  sp   .  br    br   the best part is that soup shows clips of the highlights of these shows  which are usually the funniest or most controversial moments  c  mon  most people get hooked into watching american idol because of the freak show that are the auditions   which is why most people claim to watch . and that means  i don  t have to suffer through the other    of these mind numbing talk shows or  reality  shows  for one nugget of  funny  or  shock .  the only reason why soup doesn  t get a   in my opinion are sometime the sketches are not that funny  and on an even rarer occasion  the commentary isn  t always up to par . but they can  t all be home runs either  if so  soup wouldn  t be on e  .  br    br   joel  s quick wit and soup  s writing team  which includes mchale  make for a great show . i happen to enjoy the laughing and comments from the crew who are off  camera . even when they  re being blatantly obvious by giving occasional courtesy laughs  it  s hilarious because it is forced . they  re obviously being ironic . and that  s part of what makes this show funny .  ,1
what is this  a low budget sex comedy  anyway it describes perfectly the people in spain . they could come up with a better idea  i mean they do this kind of movies since the   s . . and people like them  this is neither a teen comedy nor a family one  you can  t let your   year old watch  guys in bed kissing  he  ll never want to go to spain  . this should be rated  r   because only people    seem to laugh watching s i  m truly disappointed  maybe i don  t like gays  which is quite an important part of the movie  .  br    br   foreign humor is awful in films  except kusturica   stick with doing dramas  if you want a new comedy try talladega nights  ,0
after seeing the     remake  i thought it was the funniest way to see cruella de vil getting her punishment for torturing animals just for their skin . the whole movie was quite funny  and on my view  better than the animated one . but there was actually no need for a second one . first of all  if cruela is returning  don  t cure her and make her insane again . just make her break away from jail and that  s a rap . i thought it was not very funny . it  s supposed to have only one original puppy returning . i  d expected that it should be lucky  since he was the most appealing  and besides  having roger and anita back too . however  they decided to have a complete recasting and adding not really one hundred  not even one hundred and two  but only three puppies  and a parrot that thinks he  s a dog  clever  . gerard depardieu  s part was pointless . at the end  cruella suffers way too much  way too humiliating and way too exaggerated to be true . she gets baked inside a giant cake . that was a desperate attempt of physical humor  trying to imitate the same effect from the first one . that just didn  t work . it was too much over the top  and not too funny . i actually felt sorry about cruella .  ,0
this is very much a television version of the tale  the film starts out like an episode of  xena . . .   with little meaningful dialog or character description . it does get a bit more substantive after a while  but all characters are still cartoonish .  br    br   salma is the exotic beauty . richard harris is an evil and sexually repressed frollo  fiending to bust a nut up in salma . the other characters  including quasimodo are quite forgettable .  br    br   its also a sorta liberal version of the story  frollo is a suppressor of enlightenment ideals  like the abbot in  name of the rose   and quasimodo is a champion of liberty . the shadowy side of the quas character is ignored  though he does pour liquid led on people . he is really only an outsider in that he looks different and enjoys playing with bells more than the average person .  br    br   perhaps the film is intended for children  but i doubt it  considering frollo flogs himself bloody to amend wanting to spank his monkey . a mostly uninteresting and forgettable  but not awful  and sometimes entertaining  rendition of the tale .  ,0
this is the best dub i  ve ever heard by disney  as well as the best adaptation since the biggest abuse ever on soundtrack  themes  characters  dialogues in kiki delivery service . urrrghhh  br    br   this one has different atmosphere  especially the deviation from the common heroine . this one has both hero and heroine  although i don  t really endorse the use of hero  heroine here  since miyazaki is out from the stereotype  common theme  . as usual  after being introduced by spirited away  amazed by mononoke  troubled by grave of fireflies  and deeply touched by majo no takkyuubin  this one start with a bit doubt in my part . wondering if this will be the first ghibi  s dud . well  in the end just like only yesterday and whisper of the heart  i ended up giving   rating . i  d give  .  rating  but the additional  .  is there to share the good feeling by encouraging people to see the movie .  br    br   spoiler somehow i see this as a sad movie  people die in this one  the lonely robot  the abandoned place  and it ends with destruction . it is as if mankind really can  t live with too much power . the collapsing scene gave me patches of metropolis ending . it  s just sad somehow . the plot is apparent in most reviews and the soundtrack rules as well  as always  . joe hisaishi really belongs to uematsu  kanno  williams caliber . people who can brings a movie  a game  an event to life  even to be a lingering moments by astounding composition .  br    br   this is a feel good movie that used to be part of us cinema in the classic days  it  s a wonderful life etc etc  . well  things change . . . .  ,1
i loved the movie  but like everyone said  there were some bits that weren  t developed enough . i thought personally that the girls were very vapid before they landed in prison sure  they were supposed to be innocent american girls but still . . . i felt like they lacked that bond that best friends are supposed to have . for example  in the montage where they  re sight  seeing  the way they held each other for the photograph was very awkward  looking .  br    br   then  there are some parts that were very ambiguous . i think it  s pretty much understood that danes  character didn  t do it  but i can see how that could be confusing . also  why did the camera dwell on manat bearing a very grim expression after he put the bags in their taxi trunk  i thought it was suggesting something  but it turned out to be nothing .  br    br   apart from that  the movie was great . i cried when claire danes took the blame she  s a great actress .  br    br   also  i wanted to see that bitchy thai inmate get her ass kicked . talk about lack of closure . . .  ,1
excellent film . the whole picture was filmed in budapest  so i feel proud . my little problem was that the trains in the film belonged to the hungarian state railways  mv   and it is plain to see that they were used in big train  not in the local railway  according to the story chikatilo picked up his victims in local railway stations . apart from this  the film is superb .  ,1
way back when  the x  files was an intelligent  thought  provoking show . a big part of its appeal was that the writers looked to folklore and science for their ideas  tying the plot to the spooky side of real life .  br    br   i was incredibly wary of the  th season when it aired . the show had already provided two perfectly good episodes to bow out on   one son  and  requiem    and the  th season had seen a sharp rise in episodes that scraped the barrel for ideas that were far  fetched  implausible  or downright silly . but i figured  hey  give it the benefit of a doubt  maybe they  re bringing it back because they  ve got some great ideas lined up .  br    br    roadrunners  really was upsetting . following  patience   which at least offered an interesting angle on the vampire folklore that the show had done well to avoid  the episode sees a strange  alien   parasitic slug with the power of mind control worshipped by a cult of backwoods christians . oh  and they think it  s the second coming of christ  but you only find that out in the last couple of minutes . seriously . there  s never any attempt to make sense of this  to explain what the slug is  why anything that  s happening is happening  or anything . even in the show  s early years  in fact  especially then  you could expect a little bit more depth  a bit of background  or if not that then the opposite  a bit of mystery  some uncertainty about what this was all about .  br    br   it  s scully that really kills it though . you could put up with the silliness of the premise  but to have a character who has been developed over a good  years as a rational skeptic transformed into a gullible maverick purely for the sake of advancing the plot is bizarre to watch . you feel like you  re watching some godawful teen horror  except that it  s a woman well into her thirties throwing herself into the kind of creepy isolated community that she  s spent the best part of a decade uncovering the sinister underbelly of  being either outwitted by very stereotypical hicks or utterly indifferent to her own safety . oh  and by the way  doggett  the new mudler  isn  t around . scully just wandered off into the desert to look into a brutal murder on her own without him . he shows up at the end to save the day  i can  t even remember why  but apart from that  he  s not really in it . again seriously .  br    br   in short  it feels like either a generic script written for another show  or someone  s pet movie project which they  ve been allowed to shove like a mutant leech into the spine of an existing  long  running show at a time when it was at its most vulnerable . it might  ve worked on a lesser show  where the characters are more archetypal and the audience expects less . but the x  files had a good thing going  and scully was one of the strongest and most idiosyncratic tv characters of the   s . deciding that you  re going to change her personality for the sake of a story that they must  ve done on star trek a good fifty or so times is pointless .  ,0
well  eyeboy  i must say that it pleases me to no end when someone singles me out and tries to make fun of me  especially when it is someone who seems as intelligent as you do . my favorite part of your post was  but no big bang  bang good  guy bad  guy here  kimosabe . me suggest you stick to movie with lotsa bang bang .   br    br   well said  i do like action movies  especially if they are well done  but i also like movies that don  t have a whole lot of action  as long as they are well done . i  m sorry  but secret  s and lies does not fit into that category and is simply a very bad movie . i really don  t see very many non  american films  so maybe i was spoiled  and didn  t realize how bad foreign films really were when i saw secrets and lies . perhaps if i judge foreign movies by a different standard i could some day see how secrets and lies could possibly be one of the highest rated movies on the imdb . hmm . . . if true  that is very scary .  br    br   jeremy barger bitsmidohio . net  new e  mail   ,0
  ninteen eighty  four  is a film about a futuristic society in which the government controls everything and no one can be trusted . it is a very dark film  and it is one that will not make you feel good about yourself . it is about a romance taking place in this society and the betrayal of the lovers and about human nature being self  centred . the film has some very good ideas and is done well in portraying this society with the dark tones in colours  contrasting with happiness and bright colours in the dreams  and a general feeling of loneliness through objects and people and places . however  despite the film  s cleverness at portraying this idea  the film was very slow and did not seem to quite get the idea across . it seemed to spend too much time being clever rather than telling a story .  ,0
beforehand notification i  m sure someone is going to accuse me of playing the race card here  but when i saw the preview for this movie  i was thinking  finally   i have yet to see one movie about popular african  influenced dance  be it popular hip hop moves  breaking  or stepping  where the main character was a black woman . i  ve seen an excessive amount of movies where a non  black woman who knew nothing about hip hop comes fresh to the hood and does a mediocre job of it  breakin  breakin   save the last dance  step up   but the black women in the film are almost nonexistent . that always bothered me considering so much of hip hop  african  influenced dance  and breaking was with blacks and latinos in massive amounts in these particular sets and it wasn  t always men who performed it  so i felt this movie has been a long time coming . however  the race does not make the film  so i also wanted it to carry a believable plot the dancing be entertaining and interesting to watch .  br    br   pros i really enjoyed this film bringing jamaican culture . i can  t recall ever seeing a popular  mainstream film where all the main characters were jamaican had believable accents and weren  t stereotypical with the beanies . the steppers  family  friends  and even the  thugs  were all really intelligent  realistic people who were trying to love  live  and survive in the neighborhood they lived in by doing something positive . even when the audience was made aware that the main character  s sister chose an alternate lifestyle  it still didn  t make the plot stereotypical . i was satisfied with the way it was portrayed . i loved the stepping the romantic flirty relationship going on between two steppers the trials that the main character  s parents were going through and how she dealt with coming back to her old neighborhood and dealing with crabs in a barrel . i respected that she was so intelligent and active at the same time  and so many other sistas in the film were handling themselves in the step world . they were all just as excellent as the fellas . i don  t see that in too many movies nowadays  at least not those that would be considered black films .  br    br   cons i  m not quite sure why the directors or whoever put the movie together did this  but i question whether they  ve been to real step shows . whenever the steppers got ready to perform  some hip hop song would play in place of the steppers  hand  feet beats . at a real step show  there is zero need for music  other than to maybe entertain the crowds in between groups . and then when hip hop songs were played  sometimes the beat to the song was off to the beat of the steppers  hands and feet . it was awkward . i was more impressed with the stepping in this movie versus  stomp the yard   another great stepping movie  because the women got to represent as fierce as the guys  in  stomp the yard   meagan good got all of a few seconds of some prissy twirl and hair flip and the  deltas   let out a chant and a few steps and were cut immediately  . even when there were very small scenes  the ladies tore it up  especially in the auto shop  and it was without all that music to drown out their physical music . i know soundtracks have to be sold  but the movie folks could  ve played the music in other parts of the film .  br    br   i  m not a keyshia cole fan  so every time i saw her  all i kept thinking was  is it written in the script for her to constantly put her hand on her hip when she talks   she looked uncomfortable on screen to me . i thought they should  ve used a host like free or rocsi instead . deray davis was funny as usual though . also  i groaned when i found out that the movie was supposed to be in the ghetto  like stepping couldn  t possibly happen anywhere else . hollywood  as usual . however  only a couple of people were portrayed as excessively ignorant due to their neighborhood and losers  which mainstream movies tend to do .  br    br   i would  ve given this movie five stars  but the music playing killed it for me . i definitely plan to buy it when it comes out and hopefully the bonus scenes will include the actual step shows without all the songs .  ,1
okay  note to the people that put together these horror acting legends dvd  collections i truly am grateful and i hugely support the initiative  but  have you even watched the films before selecting them as part of the collection  when i purchased the boris karloff collection there were several films in which the star only played a supportive and unessential role   tower of london    the strange door   .  the invisible ray   however  is part of the bela lugosi collection and here it  s actually boris karloff who overshadows bela  this actually would have been a great title for the boris karloff collection instead  bela lugosi  s character is quite possibly the most good  natured and earnest one he ever portrayed in his entire career and good old karloff actually plays the mad and dangerously obsessed scientist here .  the invisible ray  features three main chapters . the first one  set in dr . janos rukh  s carpathian castle is pretty boring and demands quite a lot of the viewer  s patience  but of course the character drawings and the subject matter discussed here are fundamental for the rest of the film . dr . rukh  karloff  demonstrates to a couple of eminent colleagues  among them bela lugosi as dr . benet  how he managed to capture extraterrestrial rays inside a self  manufactured device . the scientists are sincerely impressed with his work and invite rukh and his lovely wife diane along for an expedition in the heart of africa . there dr . rukh isolates himself from the group  discovers the essential element  radium x  to complete his medical ray and goes completely bonkers after being overexposed to the meteorite himself . the third and final act is obviously the best and most horrific one  as it revolves on a good old fashioned killing spree with ingenious gimmicks  melting statues  and a surprising climax . karloff glows in the dark and  convinced the others are out to steal his discovery and even his life  he intends to eliminate them using his deadly touch . the narrative structure of  the invisible ray  sounds rather complicated  but the film is easy to follow and entertaining . the story is rather far  fetched but nevertheless compelling and director lambert hillyer provides several moments of sheer suspense . boris karloff is truly fantastic and so is lugosi  even though he deserved to have a little more screen time . their scenes together are the highlights of the film  along with the funky images of the glowing boris .  ,1
the haunted world of edward d . wood  jr . isn  t a particularly good documentary . aesthetically  it  s lackluster and cheap looking  the people in it go off on tangents which make it very unfocused and in  cohesive  but this adds to it  s charm . i say this because it  s a documentary about an oddball that made oddball pictures and surrounded himself with fellow oddballs and  as such  there  s really no other way to document the life and career of the man and his crew of misfits . there are some glimpses of insight into both the genius and the ineptness of wood  and the portrayal of both qualities is a credit to the genuineness of the documentary . overall  it  s worth a watch for the wood fan and those of cinema in general  but don  t expect brilliance here . expect a documentary made after wood  s own heart .  ,1
a high school principal  keenan wynn  with a losing basketball team unwittingly hires a coach who turns out not only to be a gorgeous blond woman  cathy lee crosby  but a catalyst for their new winning ways . are you really surprised  along the way a romance grows between the coach and the team  s star player jack  michael biehn  . the police are never notified .  br    br   packaged along with other crown international pictures as a grindhouse movie really does this film no service . this can easily be edited into a television movie of the week . cathy lee crosby looks great as coach randy rawlings especially in her skimpy outfits but i expected more than mere titillation from an r  rated film . a side plot involving a dorky center who is hypnotized by his teammates into thinking he is former nba player sydney wicks is the actual reason for the team  s new success rather than cathy lee  s coaching . too much tease and not enough sleaze makes this a major disappointment .  ,0

must confess to having seen a few howlers in my time  but this one is up there with the worst of them . plot troubling to follow . sex and violence thrown in to disorient and distract from the really poorly put together film .  br    br   i can only imagine that the cast will look back on the end product and wish it to gather dust on a shelf not to be disturbed for a generation or two . sadly  in my case  i have the dvd . it will sit on the shelf and look at me from time to time .  ,0
wonderful family drama  comedy starring macclaine and garr that entertains and warms the heart every time i see it . strongly recommended for all ages from  year olds to grannies . lovely period piece capturing     . the story encompasses the struggling garr  her two children and aunt zena  macclaine  trying to make ends meet without a man as head of the household . the  family  heads west to take the inheritance of a long forgotten relative that has left garr a run down  ramshackle road side cafe right out of the late      s . the tenacious garr  as the sweet but determined mom  gets the whole family into the restoration and opening of the cafe . but wait . . . . . . aunt zena is an old circus performer with card tricks  magic powders and a jesters sense of humor . . . . . . she loves to get the kids and her into silly and sometimes dangerous games . . . . . what happens next is a delightful combination of  miracle at lords  thrown together with the cuban missile crises  with authentic tv news from the real event  and a  ghost  prank that gets totally out of hand . this film entertains  philosophizes  questions religiosity and gives an unnerving glimpse of the frightening scare of october      s cuban missile crises . in the end one is left with the wonder of faith  family and rediscovered love . oh  and the music from the era of the early    s is just great   br    br   recommend strongly as a feel good film   out    ,1
page  is one of those films madhur bhandarkar makes to expose societal filth . the film is compelling  but  like most of bhandarkar  s films  it is one  sided and overly pessimistic . this film is all about tabloid journalism  gossip  celebrities . the film exposes the lives of socialites  whose lifestyle is disastrously boastful  peculiar and repulsive . they party  they care for nothing but fame  they plan parties at funerals  they are craving for more money and a higher reputation  they will do anything to get due exposure in the media  to get their names boldly printed on the daily newspaper  s social column known as  page   with huge photographs which will be the center of people  s discussions . they are attention seeking  salacious and hypocrite . the film industry is shown as sleazy  with casting couch being a common phenomenon among filmmakers . that  s where our lovely heroine  a young social column reporter madhvi sharma  is thrown . all these people from mumbai  s elite depend on her articles and she is the right person to befriend at these parties if you want her to mention you in her article . later in the film we learn that even those who are madhvi  s friends are no different from these high  society people . this was tough viewing for me  although the film is unquestionably brave and the issues it deals with are interesting .  br    br   the film  s music is average . the only passable songs are  kitne ajeeb  and  huzoor  e  ala   sung by the two melody queens lata mangeshkar and asha bhosle  respectively . otherwise the soundtrack is bad . one song which was particularly horrendous is  filmy very filmy  . the film  s writing is quite good . the second half is far better than the first  as it turns more matter  of  fact and exposes much more important issues such as terrorism and child abuse . that  s where the film has to be applauded . it was sad to know that people prefer to ignore such crimes out of fear and konkona sen sharma  s character  s disappointment was very easy to relate to . she was excellent throughout the film and her acting in the last few scenes was particularly impressive . atul kulkarni  s part was very small but he did full justice to it . boman irani is solid as the newspaper  s editor . sandhya mridul is lovable as madhvi  s sassy roommate pearl who marries an older man for money and is honest enough to admit it . the film  s ending is really well  done  and provides a certain sigh of relief after the unimaginably tough proceedings . page  is a good film  it is interesting and at times moving  but the level of its interest and its general quality are marred by its exaggerated  overly messy and negative portrayal of the rich and famous .  ,1
kind of hard to believe that the movie from this book could succeed in topping its awfulness  the plot is so contrived and unbelievable . . . starting with laying a ton of guilt on a small child to spare her pain  then we have the collusive behavior of at least six and maybe more people  including clergy  involved in what is a crime everywhere . next we have a wife who seemingly in the length of a ferry ride goes from being comparatively happy to very shortly kicking over the traces . a very unpleasant and coo coo mother  aided  abetted and supported by a politically correct group of friends  moving the setting from an island off the coast of south carolina  did not help the story although it may have helped the film makers budget . the very beautiful buildings supposedly housing the monastery did not seem to logically suit an island small enough to need golf carts and such a small ferry service . kim basinger whom i do really like is painfully thin in this movie and her hairdo certainly belongs in another decade . also there is simply no chemistry at all between her and either of the male leads . i thoroughly disliked the book from which this was taken but did read it all . the movie i kept surfing back and forth to  had to leave whenever that saccharine music got too much . unless you like an unbelievable story  wooden acting  a contorted mixture of religious  mythological  allegory my advice is to skip this one . oh and maybe a small carping criticism  but wouldn  t a caring father have a life jacket on a small child on a small boat  the best part of this movie is the scenery  ,0
this is going to be the most useless comment i have ever put down  but yet i must do it to warn you about the atrocity to cinema that  freddy  s dead  is . it is not only the very worst chapter of the nightmare series  but is right up there with the worst horror sequel of all time  it was boring  pointless  and nearly death free . the horrible   d ending and over  the  top corny kills are enough to drive this  film  into the ground . however  it doesn  t stop there  just add bad acting  a terrible script  and a number of cheesy cameos and you  ve got yourself this heaping pile of guano  it  s no wonder why freddy  as always played by robert englund  has made two postmortem appearances . i would too if i went out like that . this is a strictly fans only movie  don  t stare at our shame .  ,0
the first part  che in cuba  is about that portion of his life . it contains too many indistinguishable battles and che ministering to too many indistinguishable wounded  remember that che was a physician  . it ends as castro wins the revolution che never gets to havana . the second part  che in bolivia  is about guess what . it contains too many indistinguishable battles and che ministering to too many indistinguishable wounded .  br    br   when i realized this was supposed to be an  epic   i never knew anything but the title before it started   i naturally thought of the greatest epic of them all  david lean  s lawrence of arabia . more of that later .  br    br   not to be a racist  but aside from what i  ve already mentioned is the fact that there are too many characters who are  well  indistinguishable   unknown hispanic actors who look alike  especially considering they all wear  che  beards and all wear che fatigues . this results in the viewer not being able to identify with anyone other than che  benicio del toro  even fidel has a very minor role  . while del toro  s terrific  think of  lawrence  with peter o  toole as the only discernible character no alec guinness  no omar sharif  no anthony quinn  etc . you get the idea .  br    br   because the other characters are interchangeable  this results in a loss of reference . when top aides of che are killed  you feel no remorse since you don  t know who they are . even when che is killed  i don  t think that  s a spoiler   there  s no empathy from the audience   he  s just killed .  br    br   he  s too one  dimensional to relate to as a human being . aside from being a revolutionary and second only to jesus in moral rectitude  the only thing we learn about che is that he  s married with five children  he tells another character that near the end  . what was his motivation  a complete enigma .  br    br   maybe soderbergh is purposely aping lean . like soderbergh  s che  lean never lets us know anything about lawrence  the mystery man of arabia . but at least lawrence had a friend  sharif  and associates  guinness  quinn  . he was as courageous as he was insecure   i . e .  had human qualities . che is like a machine  about as warm as the terminator .  br    br   earlier this year there was another war epic  mongol . che makes mongol look like it  s a wonderful life .  ,0
this was probably the worst movie i have ever seen in my life   it was stupid there was no plot and the special affects were ridiculous   and i have never seen such bad acting in my life  the only good part about the movie were all the hot guys  especially drew fuller  . i don  t know what these people were thinking when they made this movie   i didn  t even want to finish the whole thing because you get to this point in the movie where the guys are all in bed touching themselves . i mean it was like some kind of sick and twisted kiddy porn  i would advise anyone who has heard of this movie and was interested in seeing it to just forget about it and find another movie to watch  i was very disappointed   the whole movie was a complete waste of time in my opinion .  ,0
i would have enjoyed this movie slightly more had not been for jason  herb  evers constant harping on experiment . many early reviewers of the seven samurai accused toshiro mifune of overacting . yet  as more and more critics viewed that film they saw it as being purposefully done . jason evers is obviously not toshiro mifune  and his overacting is exactly that .  br    br   most of the actors in this b classic were rather good actors  minus evers and the showgirls . if you watch this movie  you would have noticed evers shouting almost every line  that is until he is smoking and blowing the smoke coolly out his nose .  br    br   the special effects were par for the course in a b movie such as this one . in hindsight  there isn  t much that stands out in my mind as fantastically good or bad for this movie .  ,0
i read several mixed reviews and several of them downright trashed the movie . i originally became interested in this project because it was being directed by tony scott and i have become very interested in his work after man on fire had such a profound impact on me . before i start my review  let me first say this . . . it  s wonderful to see that this movie could have been told in a boring and ordinary manner  yet the writers and scott chose a different approach .  br    br   plot  br    br   simply stated  it  s not boring . most hollywood movies give  tried and true  plots that they know will connect with people  often ensuring the audiences acceptance of the film and creating a higher probability of profit . this plot was one of the more interesting ones i had seen in a while . just for reference  i recently watched  the weather man  and  lord of war  and while i will say that these movies are excellent  and i enjoyed them both tremendously  both the plots in these movies are boring and they are told exactly how you would expect them to be told . they don  t take any chances whatsoever  and they are extremely predictable after you  ve watched a fair amount of american films . domino  s plot is both interesting and told in a manner that keeps you thinking   oh man  they  re screwed now  . and i feel that has been lacking in a lot of recent films . it has a lot of depth to it  in my opinion  and gives you plenty of things to question while watching it . overall  this is what kept me so interested in the movie .  br    br   characters  br    br   i felt that the characters were accurate . knightley did a wonderful job of portraying a beautiful woman  who was anything but on the inside and wanted to be viewed as what she was . it was obvious that she wanted to prove herself and she took whatever means she had to accomplish that .  br    br   choco was also very believable  his use of spanish in inappropriate situations  his reactions to domino  s lack of affection  as well as his jealousy issues within the team . . . they all rang true to me  which made me feel that his character was that much more realistic .  br    br   rourke  s character was the least interesting to me  but it still rang true to me . he seemed like an ordinary guy  trying to make ends meet . i hope that  s what the filmmakers were trying to accomplish with him because that  s what i got out of it . he did a very good job of showing ed in an average joe kind of way that has made his mistakes  yet is still trying to live .  br    br   claremont  ladies i believe that they provided much needed  heart  to the story . they weren  t just people who are out getting money to buy a bentley  these were real people who had a real problem and they sought others mean to accomplish that goal . you could empathize with them because  to them  this child  s illness was a problem with no other solution . these characters were supposed to show real people who are less fortunate who got into this mess because they needed help .  br    br   the mobsters they made the story seem sinister in a way that only the mob can . and i really liked that part . they also padded the story with small intricacies that made the plot that much more interesting .  br    br   christopher walken       guys  br    br   they provided the comic relief in an otherwise very serious movie . from walken  s awkward statements to the ceaseless references to the      guys being has  beens . their involvement in the movie only made it that much more enjoyable .  br    br   cinematography . . . . yes . . . . the cinematography . this is where this movie seems to have lost a lot of potential fans . but in my opinion i thought it was genius  the use of the camera to translate the mood of the current situation was extremely effective in my opinion . i considered it a method that was properly realized but could always use improvement  just like anything else . i both applaud and congratulate scott  the editor  the cinematographer and the director of photography on taking some real chances with this movie . not only did they go far and above with its presentation  they went that much further . the use of colors  both extremely light and extremely dark provided the  look  of the film with a sinister and grungy look that accurately depicts the life of the mob  bounty hunters and the less fortunate in a manner that show that their life isn  t as peachy or  clean  as everyone else . if you notice  in times of less stress or conflict  there were very few camera tricks if any at all . this shows that scott and his crew were trying to achieve something with this look and weren  t just doing it for the heck of it . i realize that most people who watched this movie weren  t expecting it and it cause many of them to be turned off to this film but i think it was great that scott took this approach . hollywood films have grown predictable and bland . most of them are shot in the same manner with the same twists and turns . and i  m glad that scott tried to make something different .  br    br   granted  this movie isn  t for everyone  but to say it  s trash and has nothing to offer is completely missing the point . i thoroughly enjoyed this film and i  m glad that i spent the money for it . i would recommend this to all  but i  m sure it will only hit a chord with few . i must agree with an earlier poster when he said that many of those who refuse to see outside the  sphere of mtv  won  t appreciate this movie  but i think many people will . we should all try to enjoy it for the fact that scott and co . took some chances and tried to deliver something that was different and unique . and with that in mind  i think he succeeded tremendously .

i have been eagerly anticipating the opening of this film for several months . being a huge jim carrey fan  i easily saw how he could morph himself into seuss  grinch and make the character his own . i was not disappointed .  br    br   this movie was pure magic . carrey is a master at his trade and no one could have played this role to perfection as he did . there was plenty to enjoy for both adults and children alike and this movie is sure to become a timeless classic for all to enjoy in the years to come . i already have visions of my young daughter sitting down year after year to watch this remake on video  and i undoubtedly will watch with her and laugh as i did the first time i saw it .  br    br   clearly  this movie has jim carrey written all over it  and i do not believe that it would have come together without him . however  the supporting cast was charming and entertaining in their own right  most notably the adorable taylor momsen who was the perfect foil for carrey  s antics . the set design  musical score and costumes all lent their hands to a magical  fabulous finished product and i believe all involved can be proud .  br    br   it is not an easy feat to turn a   minute cartoon classic into a full length live action film  but howard has succeeded with flying colours . for those critics who disagree  perhaps it is your hearts that are  sizes too small .  ,1
i cannot accept the negative comments of other reviewers . they are too critical  perhaps because they are stuck in the past . i would like to see a comment from someone who had never seen basic instinct   perhaps someone very young  i left the cinema feeling glad that i had not been swayed by the imdb reviewers .   hours later i am still trying to find flaws in the plot but i cannot think of anything serious . my advice to everyone is see it for yourself and make up your own mind .  br    br   it follows a similar pattern to basic instinct  but the plot is less confused . it still left me wondering at the end but in a more satisfactory way . sharon stone is as sexy and evil as before and wears her   years extremely well this remains her defining role . david morrisey was satisfactory even though he is no michael douglas . of the supporting cast i particularly liked david thewlis as the police detective .  ,1
why do people bitch about this movie and not about awful movies like the godfather . titanic is the greatest movie of the   st century . with great acting  directing  effects  music and generally everything . this movie is always dumped by all because one day some one said they didn  t like it any more so most of the world decided to agree . there is nothing wrong with this movie . all i can say is that this movie  not only being the most heavily oscar awarded movie of all time  the most money ever made ever and sadly one of the most underrated movies i  ve ever seen . apart from that it is truly the best movie of all time . the only movies that come close to being like all the star wars and the lord of the rings trilogy or anything by the masters hitchcock or spielberg or tim burton . these are all good movies and directors but none match up to james cameron  s masterpiece titanic .  ,1
watching floored by love one thought comes almost immediately to mind   my god this looks like a really bad sitcom .  sure enough  it turns out that fbl is a pilot for a series that may start this fall in canada  poor poor canada .  br    br   cara  shirley ng  and janet  natalie sky  are a lesbian couple living in vancouver . janet has come out to her mother already but cara  s parents are still in the dark about their daughter  s homosexuality . the pressure is on to out herself though when the parents come from malaysia for her younger brother  s wedding . that same week british columbia legalizes gay marriage . with janet wanting to wed  cara has to decide whether or not to tell her conservative chinese parents that  s she  s gay . will she  would she  could she  cara  s situation is contrasted with that of jesse  trent millar  . jesse has just declared his homosexuality to the world at the age of fourteen . his biological father daniel  andrew mcilroy  is coming for a visit soon . his stepfather norman  michael robinson  fears that his chances of finally being fully accepted by jesse are harmed by the fact that daniel is gay and he is not . will dialing       makeover help   br    br   the dialogue and delivery come straight out of a lesser      s program along with the overdone physical emoting . the full house  style melodrama is enough to make you wince from time to time and the attempts at comedy largely fail . mcilroy  millar  sky are the only performers that approach competency in this miscalculation but given the material they have to work with  it  s no surprise that none impress . it  s possible that the campiness was purposeful . it often seems like there is no way the performers are really that bad  that they must be trying to mimic the inferior sitcoms of days yore . if this is indeed the case than this review should probably be rewritten . the rewrite would focus on floored by love being a poor and ineffective send  up of old sitcoms .  br    br   writer  director desiree lim has put together a by  the  numbers bland  fest that  s entirely forgettable . there was a time when merely having an openly homosexual protagonist was enough to make a mark on the screen . that time is gone . in this day we need quality as well .  ,0
this films makes no pretentious efforts to hide its true genre   a campy b movie . it will flat out tell you in the beginning the definition of campy . it should have also given the adjective meaning of cheese . but the two come together in this film in ways that make you go   hmmmmm . . . that  s so stupid   and then have you laughing . for example  there is a scene back in    th century japan   which shows a couple of samurai walking in the foreground of a temple . in the background of the temple  there are several tourists looking off in the distance in slippers and shorts . hmmmm . . . hahahah  i could not stop laughing . and the acting goes from decent  to bearable  to oh my lord  but that  s what makes it funny . you  ll see some decent actors and then find others really terrible . i have to digress somewhat though because i have seen stephanie sanchez in several plays and she is awesome . her air time in the film was pretty short though . i have also seen bryan yamasaki in several plays in the islands during my visits and he  s also better in theatre than in this movie . anyhow  it  s an entertaining film  if you  ve got nothing to do on a weekday evening .  ,1
 . . . that seem to be fooling people into seeing qualities in this film that are just not there .  br    br   near dark covered the same territory but with much more class  and action .  br    br   why the script kept their  big secret  so long was a total mystery to me  i guessed it at the breakfast scene at the start of the film . by the time it was revealed to the viewer it was just a case of  big deal  tell me something i don  t know .   br    br   i found this to be pointless movie that may have challenged the genre conventions  unfortunately those conventions are that horror films are tense and packed with genuine sense of horror . this was woeful  ,0
in a future society  the military component does not have to recruit rather  their candidates are chosen at birth  culled from nurseries and designated to spend their entire lives in the service of the government . they are given over to the war machine  body and soul  for no reason other than to protect and serve they have no personal identity other than a name and rank  and no autonomy whatsoever . this is the fate of those whose destiny is predetermined for them in soldier   directed by paul anderson and starring kurt russell . the scenario is hard and bleak as the movie begins by depicting the training of the soldiers during advancing periods of time  from preadolescence to adulthood . russell is sergeant todd  the best of the best  and we glimpse his career as he discharges his duties in an exemplary manner in campaign after campaign he is what he was born to be  a soldier . but even the best cannot go on forever  and the day arrives when todd and his peers are no longer the elite . a new generation of soldiers has been created  products of advanced genetics and technology  and todd  s generation is suddenly obsolete . what follows is the story of a man who must fight for his life  while struggling to discover his own sense of humanity and individuality  traits new to a soldier who has known only two things his entire life fear and discipline . russell gives a commanding performance as todd  the soldier who above all else must obey orders without question while suppressing all emotion and individual thoughts . he has few lines in this movie  but russell speaks volumes with his eyes . this role demonstrates that he is  in fact  one of the under  appreciated actors of our times that he can disappear so entirely into the character of todd is a credit to his ability  and with this part he has created someone quite different from any he  s done before . and he  s given todd a depth and credibility that someone of lesser talent could easily have rendered as nothing more than a pretentious and superficial stereotype . notable performances are also turned in here by connie nielsen  sandra  and jason isaacs  colonel mekum  . rounding out the supporting cast are jason scott lee  memorable as caine     one of the new generation of soldiers sean pertwee  mace   gary busey  captain church   michael chiklis  jimmy pig   and mark bringleson  rubrick  . anderson has delivered an action film with a message  a cautionary tale that transcends the genre of science  fiction . soldier  reminds us of the importance of keeping the humanity of our lives intact . it  s an entertaining way of making us consider the alternatives  like a bleak future and a world in which good movies just wouldn  t make a whole lot of difference . much like        and mad max   this movie  which is ultimately uplifting  is going to make you take pause and think about the kind of universe in which we all must live together and share . i rate this one     .  ,1
a slasher flick  made in the early    s  has a curse on it which has anyone who tries to finish it turning up dead . years later  a group of film students attempted to complete the movie  also resurrecting the films deadly curse . great idea for a film  but sadly  cut  is just another wasted opportunity .  br    br   unfortunately australia hasn  t had the world  s best track record when it comes to horror .  razorback        was an out and out dud as was  holwing iii         which was half an american film anyway . as for our foray into comedy  horror   body melt        is best left forgotten . the problem with  cut  is that the makers trying to create a clever horror satire a la  scream        but have no insight into the genre or what makes it work . and although this sounds weird me saying this about a slasher film but what  cut  really lacks is any  heart  . sure it follows the basic  rules  established by  scream   but it doesn  t want to play with the formula  instead it goes for a cardboard copy of the earlier .  br    br   the killer  scarman  is probably one of the most boring and uncharismatic villains in horror movie history . his endless barrage awkwardly  lame one  liners would make the dialogue of a porno seem like shakespeare . the cast never seem like their fully involved and look like their just waiting for a shoot to be over so they can collect their pay checks . and the feel of the film is like it  s deliberately trying not to be creepy looking more like an episode of  neighbors  or  heartbreak high  . by the way  those attempts at mtv style  hyper  cinema during the  research  sequence just look lame  dated and out of place .  br    br   if australia ever gets a chance to do horror again  which i hope we still do  maybe we should take a leaf from the  mad max        book . instead of trying to copy the u . s . we should be trying our own take on the genre .  ,0
i didn  t expect much from this  but i have to admit i was rolling on the ground laughing a few times during this film . if you are not grossly offended in the first ten minutes  this might be a film for you . ditto if you are the type that would enjoy watching amanda peet shuffling cards for an hour and a half . it  s certainly not a momentous work of comedy  but given the low  budget indy genesis this is masterful . to level the playing field for comparison  imagine all of the studio films with their budgets slashed by a factor of    or so and see what you get  kudos to peter cohen and his network for seeing this through . i look forward to his next effort .  ,1
i just finished watching this film and found it very enjoyable . it is a quiet  little film that doesn  t overwhelm you with special effects or  big  performances . it simply takes you into the lives of the people living in a small hamlet in the backwoods of north carolina .  br    br   henry thomas gives a good performance as raymond toker  a young loner who finds a baby abandoned in the woods . toker  s search for the baby  s parents takes him on a journey that will have a profound impact on his life . david srathairn plays truman lester  a slimy conman with an ulterior motive . and david plays the bad guy to perfection .  br    br   there is much more to this film than first meets the eye . filmed on location in north carolina and with a wonderful sound track of traditional music  it is worth watching .  ,1
the opening credits make for a brilliant  atmospheric piece of escapist entertainment that  s full of little nods to the comic strip . all the good guys are good  all the bad guys are bad  and the film is jam  packed with familiar character actors covered in gruesom make  up to hi  lite their characteristics .  br    br   warren beatty  as dick tracy  is the ultimate tough guy straight man  incorruptable  calm usually  always a better fighter than the other guy  and rarely one to push the limit on legality . al pacino  as  big boy  caprice steals every scene he  s in as a hunch  backed gangster in some unnamed metropolis of     s gangsters . maddonna plays the kind of person she  d probably play best  breathless mahoney  a nightclub singer and femme fatale with her own little agenda going . gleanne headly is tracy  s tough  talking  fiercely independent long  time girlfrined . and then there  s the kid  a funny little street urchin tracy takes in  who models himself after his surrogate father  and saves tracy when the detective has accepted his fate of being blown up .  br    br   the supporting players are a who  s who of character actors . charles durning is the chief of police . dick van dyke is the district attorney  who  s bribed by big boy  s goons to keep him on the streets . dustin hoffman has a humorous turn as mumbles  the snitch whose dialect is so indecipherable the cops can  t make head nor tail of what he has to say . r . g . armstrong is pruneface  one of the rival gangsters big boy forms a special allegiance to in order to create a network of crime spreading throughout the whole city . mandy patinkin is   keys  the piano player for breathless  s show . paul sorvino plays lips manlis  breathless  s former benefactor until big boy gives him  the bath .  james caan wears relatively little make  up in his performance as the only gangster who won  t go along with big boy  s grand plan . william forsythe and ed o  ross are big boy  s enforcers  flattop and itchy .  br    br   this movie retains all of the corn of the comic strip  plus it is full of vibrant colors . almost all the suits are elaborate in blues and greens and yellows and reds . all the colors of the rainbow are found in this movie   and then some  the matte paintings that are used truly realize this world as two  dimensional  only acted in three  dimensional sets . the humor is plentiful . al pacino fills the shoes of his character like no other character he  s played before or since . big boy is kind of crazy  and kind of self  pitying . he  s an eccentric little man who takes pride in quoting our founding fathers and likening himself to great political leaders . the man with the plan  always looking for the smartest way to do business .  ,1
to preface this review  i must say that i was  i suppose  a little curious about this movie . . however  i probably would not have seen it had i not had my arm slightly twisted .  br    br   in my opinion  this movie shows just how depraved man can be . in my eyes  the worst thing about this whole springer phenomenon is not that type of people on the  jerry springer show  act as they do  which in itself is eminently reproachable   but that many people are so curious and excited to watch them and hear about their lives  yes  i suppose that includes me . . to whatever extent it is true  . if not glorifying that kind of behavior  as some might say  at the very least we may be subtly corrupting our minds and  or desenstizing ourselves to this type of behavior .  br    br   but enough soapbox  sort of  . here  s the skinny the movie has an r rating  and while it may deserve only that  i did look away at some scenes  so i  m not completely sure   i feel that an nc     tip of the hat to the other reviewer  might be a little more appropriate for the immense sexual content  a cynic might comment that the movie was just one big excuse to show sex on the big screen  . the plot is very bizarre  tying together the stories of an absolutely dysfunctional family and a group of stereotypical blacks upset who will appear on different springer shows . at the end  the movie leaves one with some resolvement  and springer rhetoric about the need for us to see the real world  evidently as seen through his show  . i agree with him there  it is important to know how the world really is so that we can seek to effect positive change . having said that  let me just tell you  the world  s pretty bad  glance in a newpaper or the news to see that  but let  s not shell out good money to support the kind of sensationalistic and perhaps formulaic titallition that springer seeks to give us .  ,0
 . . . you know the rest . if you want a good zombie movie  don  t rent this movie . if you want a documentary  esquire look at  hood life  you  re at the wrong place as well . if you  re looking for a laughable piece of film  this is a real winner  the acting is as flat as a piece of paper . the best example of this is definitely the officer investigating the drive  by . i can tell that he did the voice for the    operator as well by the flat tone of his voice . if i could hear a cardboard box talk  it  d probably sound like this guy . oh yea  and the  zombies  did their best snake impression which is on par with their fantastic acting overall  note sarcasm . . . how did this not win an oscar for best make  up  the quiroz . . . . . . did not do any sort of directing . i felt like i was watching an improvisational period piece  the period is more like      s la  the direction is however one  uped by the worst script i think to ever grace a movie . i haven  t heard such lovely lines  like the epic one word beginning to the movie  fk    since ice grill which was another  urban  thriller . this only works of course in conjunction with the also  epic hip  hop soundtrack  all  or so songs of it  all in all  what the hell did you expect from a movie entitled  hood of the living dead   i rented this movie with full intention to laugh at its every scene  and boy it delivered and more  i would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to get together with a bunch of guys and laugh at a low budget horror  yea right . . .  movie for the night . a memorable experience for sure   ,0
i initially gained interest in this film after reading a review saying this movie reminded the reviewer of silent hill .  br    br   being a huge silent hill fan  and disappointed with it  s movie debut  i thought i would give this one a chance . mind  fearnet only lists this movie as  dark floors   not by it  s full name . so when i saw the name  mr . lordi  in the credits i immediately thought of the band  i had a few friends in college that like them  but didn  t think it was important and quickly pushed the thought aside .  br    br   the film starts out strong . despite the fact  creepy little girl  has been done to death  the good use of audio and sense of isolation really started to piece the the story together . the tense atmosphere built rapidly  and every indication pointed to the film being excellent . as monsters are the true stars of horror  i couldn  t wait to see what was lurking in the halls of the hospital the main characters had found themselves trapped in . . .  br    br   and then the first monster showed up  and i found myself greatly underwhelmed . by the time the second appeared  i boggled at the fact it looked like it had just come from a megadeth concert  and the silliness turned me off completely .  br    br   over the course of the movie the atmosphere did remain intact  and the story left you wondering just what was going on  but the scares were pretty much non  existent . however  i held out hope that the end would make it all worthwhile . unfortunately that was not to be the case . by the time the movie had reached it  s climax  i was in utter disbelief  and i immediately recognized the big bad in his final reveal . . . the lead singer of lordi  seriously   br    br   was that what the movie all boiled down to  a bunch of poor souls being chased around a hospital by lordi band members  the silly monster design suddenly made sense . if you  re going to be that corny  may as well through the members of marilyn manson  or even kiss in there too . not to mention the fact that i  m pretty sure i saw the ending in one of lordi  s music videos a few years ago . they had to go and make an entire movie off of it   br    br   worst of all  when i found out what really had been going on  all i could manage was a yawn . i  m not going to  ruin  it for you  but i can safely say it  s probably a plot device you  ve seen before . most likely more then once .  br    br   so  unless you  re a huge lordi fan  stay away from this . it  s not scary  it doesn  t bring anything new to the table  although it does a decent job of borrowing from other horror movies  mainly silent hill  . and  i can  t stress this enough  lordi is the antagonist . lordi . talk about a buzzkill .  br    br   really  you  d be better off trying to scare yourself watching slipknot music videos . in other words  it  s just not possible .  ,0
some good movies keep you in front of the tv  and you are dying to see the result .  br    br   this movie does not have highs and lows . it simply describes a young girl  s family life in africa . people come and go  the weather and the background are all the same .  br    br    ,0
the silent film the pride of the clan starring mary pickford was supposed to be set in a fictional island off the coast of scotland . in actuality  most of the exterior shots were filmed in marblehead massachusett on marblehead neck near several rocky seaside geographic areas including the churn and castle rock . my initial interest in the film was because of two factors   the marblehead film location in my hometown and    the fact that my grandmother lizzette m . woodfin was hired as a stand  in for mary pickford during filming of several scenes including the  cliff scene  . both women were small     in stature and both my father and grandmother related the fact that she was a stand  in with her back to the camera for the cliff scene as part of the chiefton filming set . i just wanted to relate this story for future film historians and buffs . the film itself  my dvd copy is somewhat poor  is very well done with lots of action and expressive acting including several scenes where miss pickford portrays a strong woman characterization . i enjoyed it and would love to get a better copy of it although i am unsure whether one exists as i have seen in various movie sites that remaining copies are dark because of deterioration . a very nice film of the silent genre with lots of action   ,1
the film my name is modesty is based around an episode that takes up about one page in the   th modesty blaise novel called night of the morningstar . it describes an incident in which the young modesty    in the book  mid twenties in the film  asserts her leadership in a war over a casino . as this is set before the actual blaise adventures her trusted sidekick willi garvin is not in the film . that is one of the main problems as the relationship between blaise and garvin was certainly always one of the fascinating aspects of the novels and the long running comic strip . the other problem is that the film is quite simply incredibly boring because it really is just one small episode blown up into a screenplay . the casting is okay but alexandra staden is not really convincing as the heroine and actually too old for the role to play the young modesty . i get the impression that this film was a quick and dirty solution as not to lose the rights to the blaise franchise .  ,0
never before have the motives of the producers of a motion picture been more transparent . let  s see first  they get every willing televangelist to hype this film as the greatest thing since sliced white bread . next  they encourage as many fundamentalist christians as possible to purchase copies of the film so as to recoup its paltry production costs and pump up its advertising budget . and finally  when the film hits the theaters  get as many said christians as possible to see it yet again  bus them into the multiplexes if necessary  not on the merits of the film itself  but because a   box office opening will be seen as some sort of profound spiritual victory .  br    br   but that  of course  won  t be enough . i imagine that any film critic with the audacity to give  left behind  anything short of a glowing review will be deemed  anti  christian .   br    br   of course  this shamelessly manipulative marketing campaign shouldn  t surprise anyone . it is  after all  good old fashioned capitalism at work . what does surprise me is how many people have been suckered into the whole  left behind  mindset . as someone who tries to balance his spiritual beliefs with some sense of reason and rationality  it leaves me scratching my head . it would appear that there are many  many people who actually believe that sometime in the near future a  rapture  is going to occur  and that millions of people all over the earth are going to simultaneously vanish into thin air . what kind of reality  i wonder  are these people living in  is this  rapture  something they actually believe in  or is it something they fervently want to believe in  and when they reach the end of their lives and realize this  rapture  has not occurred  will they be disappointed and disillusioned  will there still be people    years from now insisting that the  rapture  is imminent   br    br   in a way  i almost wish that such an event would occur  what an interesting day that would be  what would be even more interesting is if the apocalypse were to occur in a more spectacular fashion  not in the anthropological sense the authors of the  left behind  series have portrayed  but as more of a stephen spielberg production  with boiling clouds  trumpets  angels descending out of the sky  moon turned to blood  the whole nine yards . imagine coming to the realization that it was all coming true  just as the evangelists had been warning for years  and that there was something more awesome than just the cold  hard  physical reality we inhabit . wouldn  t that be something     br    br   yet in the final analysis  it  s that cold  hard  physical reality that i will content myself with . my life is not so meaningless that i need the fear of a  rapture  and the  end times  to make sense of it all . . . nor do i need heaven or hell to bribe or scare me into behaving decently  thank you very much .  ,0
i felt rancid aluminium was a complete waste of two hours  the plot line was thin and confusing  the prestigious line up of players had some terrible dialogue and extremely questionable accents . the camera work was somewhat experimental in places and although it could be seen what the director was trying to convey  it just made it even more difficult to watch . one of the most annoying aspects of rancid aluminium is the over use of narration throughout the film almost like the entire plot is being dictated to the audience . the best performances weren  t anything to do with acting . in fact probably the most convincing performance came from dani behr of all people  although admittedly does play the stereotypical office secretary . do not under any circumstance go and see this movie unless you need a reason to catch up on some lost sleep  there are certainly better ways to spend your hard earned cash .  ,0
i  m not even sure what to say about this film . it  s one of only a handful of movies ever made that i would consider romantic . to try to talk plot or performance or technical details about this film would be in the words of frank zappa  like dancing about architecture  . it absolutely hits the nail right on the head in the way it captures those fleeting moments in life that move us and then run away from us never to be experienced again . this seems like the movie the character version of charlie kaufman in the movie adaptation wanted to write . the ending is left open and ambiguous  no happy ending here  just mystery . no profound life lessons  just a couple of horny and intelligent kids exploring the ability to feel the most irrational and unrealistic of feelings . . . . . . romantic love .  br    br     out of   watch it with your special lady and recommend it to a stranger . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  ,1
i have to say as being a fan of the man who created halloween  the fog  christine  the thing  probably his best films .  br    br   then you got this pos . i can  t logically think he put any effort at all into this like he did with cigarette burns . at least his son made a decent soundtrack .  br    br   you have to look at this from the standpoint that it didn  t seem like a movie . it looked as if someone else directed it for one thing . i won  t believe carpenter put any effort into this at all .  br    br   i was just listening to his old school h   h   the fog soundtrack and it was awesome  especially for the times .  br    br   he was using a style that no one had and it worked so well for his films .  ,0
chris rock  apparently desperate for a cozy star  vehicle which would cross his appeal over to white and mainstream black audiences  updates the hit     comedy  heaven can wait  with an urban agenda . he plays a struggling comedian involved in a car accident who has his soul removed too soon from his body   consequently  his angels must find another body to place him in  and can only come up with that of a white businessman . rewriting a movie as bland and sentimental as  heaven can wait  only shows that rock  s eye was on the box  office  this was strictly a corporate move organized by the most mercenary of hollywood players  . why not strive for something loftier or more memorable than a silly reincarnation comedy that culminates with an evening at the apollo  terrific supporting cast  including the usually  reliable regina king  the wonderful mark addy  wanda sykes  eugene levy  and terrific frankie faison  do what they can  but rock seems awkward and unsure of himself throughout .     from   ,0
i  ve seen this movie on several different occasions . i find one of the funniest things to do is to just watch the reactions of the different types of people who go to see it .  br    br   type   old people . a lot of old japanese men and women go to this movie because they think it will be a honest  to  goodness samurai movie with lots of swordplay and medieval japanese dialogue . as soon the two protagonists begin debating horror movies while inserting expletives almost randomly throughout their sentences  the old people walk out  usually disgusted .  br    br   type   film snobs . these people think that just because a movie bears the label of  independent  that it will automatically be a load of hard  to  follow  overemotional crap that may or may not be in english . yet they see it anyway just to sing praises about it later so that people will think they are intelligent and cultured . they are really in for a surprise when they see this film . as soon as the blood begins to squirt exaggeratedly from anime  inspired sword battles or the over  the  top villain nonchalantly pegs a dog with his crossbow during a phone conversation  these people will be so dismayed  they will walk out . a few will stay just to see  how bad it will get  and later they  ll rave about what a horrible film it was to their friends .  br    br   type   people expecting to see live  action anime or matrix  like special effects . sorry folks  the martial arts are pretty solid in the film  but director yamasato really doesn  t have the budget for that kind of thing .  br    br   type   people with no expectations . these are the people who really enjoy the film . whether they had only heard of blood of the samurai  picked it at random  or stumbled into the wrong theater in an alcoholic haze  these are the people who will laugh at all the jokes and appreciate the movie for what it ultimately is entertainment . this movie was not made to enlighten or to provoke deep spiritual thought  it was meant  if i may borrow a line of dialogue from the film  to  really kick some ass .  and that  s what it does .  br    br   so depending on what type of person you are  you may or may not enjoy this film however  if you appreciate the movie for what it is and can enjoy an excess of blood and acting  then go see this movie and make sure to bring your friends .  ,1
this is one of the all  time great  our gang  shorts . spanky is at his very cutest and funniest  and the babies that he get  s left to babysit are also hilarious . tiny spanky is coerced by the gang into watching all their little siblings . the opening shot of them all in baby carriages  being entertained by various things hung by the gang from fishing poles is a beautiful gag .  br    br   spanky  s appearance wearing his huge toy knife when asked to babysit by the older fellows is priceless  as is his response    hey  where do you get that stuff   i don  t take care of no babies   the tiny fellow saying  remarkable  throughout the film  all the beautiful sight gags  and spanky telling the babies  all about tarzan  add up to make this one of the best  our gang   s you  ll ever see .  ,1
anyone who loved the two classic novels by edward ormondroyd will be disappointed in this film . all the magic and romance have been modernized out of his original story of a girl who does a good deed for a mysterious old lady  and given  three  in return . three what  not three wishes  but three rides into the      s on a rickety elevator . . .  br    br   the first novel is time at the top . the second is all in good time .  ,0
a thief in the night is an excellent fictional account of the weeks leading up to the rapture and the weeks following that pivotal event .  br    br   i thoroughly enjoyed both the production values and the content values of this independent christian movie .  br    br   the production values . hey  it  s an independent movie  with a shoe  string budget  so  ya  it  s going to look a bit cheesy  if your standard is a  list hollywood fare  . but  properly compared with other independent movies  this film is perfectly acceptable . more important than acting style  costumes  and music is the narrative itself . is the story compelling  do the dramatic moments work  does the story trajectory build to a satisfying climax  the answer to all these questions is an unqualified  yes .  as a side  note  the truly important technical stuff   continuity  sound  lighting   are fine . the viewer is able to watch the show without being distracted by sloppy craftsmanship .  br    br   content value . the message of the movie is superb . when you consider how many ideas the movie  maker developed within the brief span of   minutes  you begin to appreciate his artistry . he presents the message of salvation  the consequence of unbelief  the danger of backsliding  the truth of the rapture  and the threat of a world  dominating satanic government with flare  imagination  and   most importantly for an evangelical movie   with biblical accuracy .  br    br   the movie  maker is a good storyteller . for example  he develops the message of salvation in two important ways    he shows us through action the reality of jesus christ  s sacrifice for our sake . this is achieved in a subplot where the zoo  keeper is bit by a poisonous snake and nearly dies . the only cure is blood from someone who is immune to the snake  poison . the poison is like sin the cure is like christ  s blood  shed on the cross .    the filmmaker also develops the message of salvation through dialog . he has various characters explain the truth about human sin and the need for salvation through faith in christ . so  the movie  maker uses both action and dialog to tell his story .  br    br   as a side  note  the fact that a movie produced by evangelical christians actually contains dialog and scenes that convey a clearly delineated message of salvation  couched in explicitly evangelical christian language  imagery  and theology is also perfectly acceptable . to criticize this film for being explicitly christian is absurd it  s akin to criticizing a nike commercial for promoting sport  wear . what else would evangelical christian movie makers make  if not a film that states their case  also  the fact that the movie  maker employs the idea that the unbelieving will be left behind in a godless world is  again  perfectly acceptable . the movie  maker uses the dramatic potential of that idea admirably . how do i know  i heard about a thief in the night from a woman who saw the show way back in      it still lived in her memory thirty years later . how many movies can you say that about  all around  a very enjoyable  thought  provoking show . i plan on showing it to my teen group at church .  ,1
always fancied this film from the video cover . eventually got round to buying it for a fiver in a sale and boy what a film . a simply stunning performance from all of the case and it  s filmed so beautifully . even at times from a distance so you can barely hear what the dialogue is  as if you really are that distance away picking up bits of the tale . it  s really moving  frequently amusing and very watchable . not much dialogue but is filmed in such a way that you feel so much throuout . a     from me . a must see .  ,1
camp blood iii is a vast improvement on camp blood ii as it has sound mostly in the right places and a rudimentary plot . this time they  ve ventured slightly further away from the car park the other two movies were filmed in which is a good move as you can no longer hear cars driving past what is supposed to be a remote wilderness .  br    br   this time around there  s a reality tv show and a fake clown to scare off the contestants . this is hardly a new idea  i  ve seen at least three other horror movies with exactly the same premise where the real killer turns up but at least this one has a plot instead of people just randomly being stabbed with a knife .  br    br   unlike the other two in the series this one is at least good for a few laughs . i liked how there  s a gunshot sound effect when someone gets stabbed early on and the way the boom mike hovers behind people like a phantom .  br    br   i don  t know why anyone would want to make a third camp blood film  i would have thought it would be better to start from scratch but they have at least tried with this one . the half naked deformed woman was a bit much for me  it looks like they tried to keep continuity by hiring some freak who would get her clothes off for   just like they did in the second movie . they still haven  t worked out that a machete is used for cutting not stabbing but oh well  it  s a camp blood movie what do you expect  if you like crap films you  ll get some fun out of this one .  ,0
everyday we can watch a great number of film  soap . . . on tv . sometimes a miracle happens . a great film  with real feelings  with great actors  with a great realisator  director . for me there are two films that everyone needs to see  the first is the pacula   sophie  s choice  with meryl streep . the second is  journey of hope  . as human beings  we need to learn about humility  about love of the others  about acceptation of other civilisation  other way of living . we also have to struggle against racism and fascim . we must avoid judging  criticize we only have to love our earth companion . this wonderful film  helps us reaching john  lennon  his dream  imagine all the people living live in peace . these two films are difficult to see  watch these  but sure you will be hurt  but better . great film  great actors  terrible story  pain and cry guarantee  but also better understanding of the others . enjoy it .  ,1
this film has got to be ranked as one of the most disturbing and arresting films in years . it is one of the few films  perhaps the only one  that actually gave me shivers not even pasolinis slo  to which this film bears comparison  affected me like that . i saw echoes in the film from filmmakers like pasolini  fassbinder and others . i had to ask myself  what was it about the film that made me feel like i did  i think the answer would be that i was watching a horror film  but one that defies or even reverses the conventions of said genre . typically  in a horror film  horrible and frightening things will happen  but on the margins of civilized society abandoned houses  deserted hotels  castles  churchyards  morgues etc . this handling of the subject in horror is  i think  a sort of defence mechanism  a principle of darkness and opacity functioning as a sort of projective space for the desires and fears of the viewer . so  from this perspective  hundstage is not a horror film it takes place in a perfectly normal society  and so doesnt dabble in the histrionics of the horror film . but what you see is the displacement of certain key thematics from the horror genre  especially concerning the body and its violation  the stages of fright and torture it can be put through . what seidl does is to use the settings of an everyday  middle class society as a stage on which is relayed a repetitious play of sexual aggression  loneliness  lack and violation of intimacy and integrity precisely the themes you would find in horror  but subjected to a principle of light and transparency from which there is no escape . it is precisely within this displacement that the power of seidls film resides . hundstage deals with these matters as a function of the everyday  displays them in quotidian repetition  rather than as sites of extremity and catharsis  a move you would encounter in said horror genre . one important point of reference here is rainer werner fassbinder . fassbinder also had a way of blending the political with the personal in his films  a tactics of the melodrama that allowed him to deal in a serious and even moral way with political issues like racism  domination  desire  questions concerning ownership  sexual property and control  fascism and capitalism etc . seidls tactic of making the mechanisms of everyday society the subject of his film puts him in close proximity with fassbinder like this german ally  he has a sort of political vision of society that he feels it is his responsibility to put forward in his films . during a seminar at the gothenburg film festival this year  at which seidl was a guest  he was asked why he would have so many instances of violated  subjugated women in hundstage  but no instances of a woman fighting back  liberating herself . seidl replied that some may view it as immoral to show violence against women  but that he himself felt it would be immoral not to show it . an artistic statement as good as any  i think . thank you .  ,1
the thing that stands out in my mind in this film  sadly  is the introduction  where john berlin  andy garcia  is driving into town . you see his mercedes pass on a winding road through a forest that looks like its loaded with redwood trees . it  s quite beautiful .  br    br   as to andy garcia playing a character with the last name of berlin  well . . . andy is just too hispanic  latin for it to be passable . maybe a caucasian father married his spanish mother for this story  who knows . but i can tell you that when you put him in a town of farm folks and hicks  he stands out like a sore thumb  especially with his accent that flares up when he gets angry . yeah  i know  big deal right  he  s still a good actor .  br    br   the title concerns a serial killer who nicknames his victims jennifer . all of the victims are blind and he dismembers them . the killer has taken a hiatus but suddenly resurfaces when a blind witness  don  t ask  appears  helena robertson  uma thurman  . thurman does a good job of playing a blind person  to my surprise . when i saw lance henriksen playing sgt . freddy ross i got worried . henriksen  s played in some pretty strange films  especially of late . i still can  t forget him in the bloodbath movie  pumpkinhead .  br    br   berlin movies into a small town from l . a . as a detective . he begins investigating the jennifer murders after finding body parts in the local landfill . his brilliance in discovering one of the victims was blind seemed far  fetched . so did the irony of spoiler freddy  s murder  with the recording and name similarities . i got very confused as to the logic of how there came to be eight  jennifers  . and the motive of the killer as simply deranged didn  t pack much of a punch . in retrospect  this film is probably more true to life in showing an unsuspecting individual as capable of murder simply because they became a little wacko over time or maybe were born looney toons .  br    br   john malkovich does a stupendous job in his interrogation of garcia  albeit no cop would legally be allowed to press someone that hard and egg them on without rightfully get knocked out . as to the ending  it is a bit of a surprise  but is highly arguable  much like sgt . ross  murder . the killer chooses to walk after his running victim  opting instead to frolick i guess .  br    br   and there are so many opportunities he has in killing her that it  s ridiculous . i won  t ruin the very end because despite it  s shakiness  it  s a good surprise . afterward though  you  ll probably say  as i did   boy was she lucky        ,0
must every good story be  improved  with added corny broadway music  apparently those who can  t come up with their own plots think that classic literature is just there for the plundering . i confess that oliver twist and similar stories are not my favorites  as it is certainly true that dickens often wrote things that leave you considerably bummed out  and this was a great example of just that . . . so of course  take this serious tale and add nauseating music and camp it up with every character from prancing orphan boys to mincing bobbies and suddenly it  s uplifting  argh . fetch me a basin .  br    br   the four stars in my rating come from casting  which i could liken to that of my fair lady . each of these films had a cast that a play version could be proud of  but then they must go and have them sing  see complaint above  . unlike my fair lady  those singing here could actually do so and they mercifully spared us the singing voice of oliver reed  pardon if i  m mistaken  it  s been a while  .  br    br   my biggest complaint i  ve stated . why embarrass everyone except the truly shameless by putting silly songs into a perfectly good story  seldom has this been done to good effect . generally it ruins the story . it did with this one . jury  s still out on whether this story is worth saving  but with all that gadding about  it  s impossible to tell .  ,0
i felt this movie started out well . the acting was spot on and i felt for all the characters situation  even though the true family unit was not completely revealed . we never got enough info on the father to truly feel his pain for his whole involvement or the build up for his animosity with tobe . i mean in one scene you see him admiring her for tensity and in another scene he just about takes her head off . another problem with the movie was it just unraveled and lost all focus by the end  and i was begging for it to just be over with . any movie with such a long drawn out  and painful ending should never get an automatic rating of  or above just for the acting . we are looking at the over all quality of the movie experience . in the case of this movie the end is so bad i seriously contemplated just walking out of the theater . this movie pulled me in then just spit me out .  ,0
i loved this film  at first the slick graphics seemed odd with the grainy footage but i quickly got into it . there must have been thousands of hours of footage shot and i really admire the work done in cutting it down . if you  re easily shocked by drugs or violence it might not be the film for you but there are some great characters here   and some real tossers  . technically i liked it a lot too  they must have used a new de  interlacing algorithm or maybe it was just that the footage looked so dark anyway but i wasn  t annoyed by the usual artifacts seen in video to film transfers .  open water drove me nuts  mostly because there are cheap  progressive cameras available now and i see no excuse in not shelling for one if you intend to screen in the cinema  . sorry that  s my own little rant . i definitely recommend this film if you  ve ever been involved with the music scene  it has some tragic moments but most of it is hilarious  i might be accused of laughing at others misfortune but it  s a classic piece .  ,1
hollywood now has officially gone too far and i really hope that this travesty of a motion picture creates a genuine backlash against their crap machines  in spite of the good box office returns . if you are an industry person reading our comments looking for hints on what to do next  stop . stop making our tv shows into these repellent  stupid  money grubbing waste of time movies that suck . by doing so you are proving one thing hollywood is out of ideas  and going to see the movies they churn out only perpetuates the cycle of disgust . what  s next   you guys gonna go  ruin the bionic man    br    br   the film is just plain wrong  and manages to get the most stupid  simple fact of the show totally incorrect by forgetting  or ignoring  that tom wopat  john schneider  s bo  luke duke were reformed moonshiners . they had been busted  learned their lesson  gone straight  and were there to help people and be good neighbors who just happened to shoot dynamite tipped arrows from hunting bows  drive like steve mcqueen . denver pyle  s uncle jessie was also the moral center of the family  always insisting that the boys do good  even at their own expense or embarrassment while he made sandwiches and coffee for when the chores were done . they always did the right thing and had a sort of earnest naivet about them that was quite appealing . we wanted to be more like them than we were  sorta . my favorite gimmick from the show was how they always buckled their seat belts before roaring off  which was apparently too moral for this film .  br    br   by transforming the duke family into a pack of leering  wisecracking  criminally minded  redneck baiting  misogynistic losers the movie has no moral standpoint  where the show was all about how honest or incorruptible the dukes were   are the duke boys in this movie supposed to come off as good guys  i wanted to punch them both in the nose . they seem to have a lot of free time on their hands that could be spent doing chores back at the farm and end up pursuing less than noble ends  if not acting like a pair of   year old boys who haven  t grown up . there should be no marijuana use  no gawking at buxom  nubile coeds  their breasts  no shenanigans involving the brothers in da hood . all of it looks like the work of a marketing consultant who took a poll at the mall of what   year old boys like to see in movies . the problem being that   year old boys cannot possibly remember the show  imho shouldn  t be seeing this movie either  and the parents who might feel nostalgia for the show will be disgusted by what the writers  director  producers did to our collective memories just to part us from our money  which is exactly how i feel . what were they thinking     br    br   and boy did they ever get daisy wrong . jessica simpson all dolled up like a pamela anderson mall slut may be the only reason for anyone to see this disgrace  but you can service your needs just fine downloading some promotional stills of her  printing them up  pinning them to the wall in a restroom . she is hardly in the film at all  which is the movie  s only saving grace   and the ten minutes or so they used her was still excessive . catherine bach  s daisy may have had the same kind of shorts  and long legs that make people feel funny just looking at her  but the daisy she played was a person . the pratfalls she elicited by simply being who she was had an almost natural ring to it . she remains one of the most outrageously sexy pop culture icons ever created but there was somebody at home . and most importantly she was a sweet  caring person who couldn  t help it if the guys went ga ga over her .  br    br   by contrast  jessica simpson appears phony  contrived  made up  costumed  posed  aloof  bored  out of place  and i don  t think she even looks that great in the outfit . she doesn  t look like a person but a plot device  conjured up during a deal with someone representing her agent . ms . simpson would be well advised to fire that person immediately and pretend like the whole thing never even happened . whatever the joke was  she isn  t in on it and is disgracefully exploited for ta . if that  s all she wants from her career  executive produce the sequel if only to ensure yourself enough screen time at least  because this effort was just pathetic .  br    br   the bottom line is skip it . for the cost of two tickets and a slurpee to go you can pick up one of warner bros . excellent box set collections of the original shows on dvd and the entire family can watch them together . that was why it worked . the only real purpose i can see in the film might be it  s future use as an interrogation tool at guantanamo bay . twenty minutes of this  they  ll be singing a choir .  br    br        and i mean it . and stay the hell away from the bionic man  you schnooks .  ,0
unbelievably awful film . i watched part of this on t . v . recently . my jaw dropped as i watched a horrendously conceived plot and listened to mind  numbing drivel . not a single line from the master of one  liners could come close to producing anything resembling a chuckle . it was so bad it made me want to exhume rodney dangerfield  s body  slap him around and scream   how could you   i know many films are done in haste  hoping to cash in on the popularity of a given actor or theme . but please  hollywood  show a little respect for your audience . it  s sad and scary that people were expected to pay to see such tripe . the bottom of the cesspool  even by sunday afternoon television standards .  ,0
beginning with its long opening shot of seemingly endless rows of assembly line workers in a chinese factory  manufactured landscapes attempts to show the devastating impact of industrialization on the natural environment and traditional societies . its droning narrative assumes that industrial development in china and elsewhere is entirely unprecedented  as if there had never been an industrial revolution in europe and america and karl marx had never visited the british museum . that there might be a connection between the present  day asian drive for industrialization and wealth and earlier experiences of starvation and terror is never mentioned .  br    br   at the same time  there  s an effort to present edward burtynsky  s photographs of industrial waste as somehow  beautiful  . much of the film is a slide show of these images . they are well produced  of museum size  and have apparently appeared in several exhibitions . to me  however  they only demonstrate that almost any photograph can be made to appear beautiful if well presented . industrial waste is still industrial waste . the relationship  if any  between the photographs and the film  s spoken message remains unclear .  br    br   i don  t mean to imply that there aren  t real and sometimes desperate problems when countries rush to industrialize . manufactured landscapes  however  offers only strange and bitter hopelessness . it  s like a two  hour lecture by noam chomsky . maybe it has some value as a demonstration of what  s wrong with the american  and canadian  left .  ,0
 . . . but the general moviegoer  s mileage may vary in mary  american psycho  harron  s stylized look at the american sexual psyche as seen through the lens of the immortal queen of curves  bettie page .  br    br   i  ll not bore anyone with a recitation of the iconic status of ms . page  a prim and proper valedictorian from nashville  tennessee  who moved to new york in hopes of being an actress and ended up becoming the bondage queen of the universe . nor will i run through the sketchy bio  pic plot of  the notorious bettie page   though i offer high kudos to the technical aspects of the film  a sequence of animated magazine covers springs instantly to mind   improper use of a period camera notwithstanding . finally  i won  t belabor the timely applicability of the film  s themes of innocence and perversion  freedom and control  the sacred and the secular they  re there for the viewer to absorb  if they wish . the more things change  the more they stay the same  as the saying goes .  br    br   what i will ramble on about for a moment is the splendid performance of gretchen mol as bettie page . truth is  mol  s face looks almost nothing like bettie  s  nor is she particularly built like bettie  although only a fool would deny those beautiful breasts  and no fool  i   . she doesn  t even sport the thick  dark bush that concealed ms . page  s most intimate charms  but the fact remains that mol thoroughly embodies the spirit of bettie page in every way  shape  and form . it is a bravura  comeback  from an undeserved semi  obscurity . i  ve never met ms . page  and sadly  never will  most likely   but i  ve devoured the photos and videos  and read all the bios and interviews available  bought the trading cards and other odds and ends  and to be honest  lusted for ms . page ever since i first discovered her in my adolescence between the covers of dusty tease magazines at the barber shop and the five and dime . mol perfectly captures the essence of the woman as i have come to conceive her  no pun intended  in what i consider to be an oscar  worthy performance . liv tyler could never have matched mol  s shining intensity of characterization in a million years  and i  for one  am grateful she left the project . not that i  d mind seeing her totally naked  i hasten to add  but i can  t imagine that her brand of sensuality would have translated into the innocent exhuberance of bettie page .  br    br    the notorious bettie page  is not for everyone  any more than bondage and discipline are . i suspect it will do much better on disc than in the theaters legions of devoted page fans and the curious will see to that . i can only hope that the dvd will be chock full of enough bettie extras to show the uninitiated just how good a job mol has done .  br    br   beyond that  a tip of the hat to a fine supporting cast  especially lili taylor and chris bauer as paula and irving klaw  whose celebrity photo business was bettie  s doorway to immortality .  br    br   a final note to the young scribe who opined that ms . page had no effect on his generation take a good look at madonna  s cone brassiere and get back to us . bettie page is  whether you know it or not  the true godmother of fetishwear . without her  madonna and the rest of her kin could never have existed .  ,1
i had lost faith in sooraj r . barjatya after the movie main prem ki deewani hoon  then a year back now i saw promos for vivah which looked good . but i didn  t want to waste my hard earned money watching it in cinema . when the film first came out on dvd i rented it and watched and i loved the movie and took back my words for sooraj . i just finished watching it yesterday again and this time i thought i have to review this movie . sooraj r . barjatyagot it right this time  okay i was not a huge fan of hum app ke hai kaun . but i have always loved manie pyar kiya  after manie pyar kiya to me i think vivah is barjatyas best work . i hardly ever cry in a movie but this movie made me feel like crying . if you have ever been in love before then there will be many moments that will touch you in this movie  the movie is just too sweet and will have you falling in love with it  my view a much underrated movie .  br    br   the story of this movie you might call desi and very old times  but to me it seemed modern because the two couples which are getting an arrange marriage are aware it  s an old tradition . it  s done in present times  lots of people don  t believe in this arrange marriage  but i do . the journey between the engagement and wedding which will always be special and this movie shows it clearly . when prem meets poonam for the first time  they show it how it is and that  s reality and my parents where saying that  s how they got married and it showed it in a way which is so real yes people the way prem and poonam meet in this movie is how most marriages happen . it was a very sweet  you feel nervous yet excited  the song  do ajnabe  shows that very well . getting back to the story yes it  s a journey which you soon get glued to between prem and poonam  shahid kapoor and amrita rao  and there families . a twist occurs in this movie which is really good  the last   mins you all will be reaching for the tissue box .  br    br   what makes this film so amazing is the chemistry between prem and poonam  how they fall for each other is too sweet . simple boy and simple girl  when they first meet during and after the song  do anjane ajnabe  it  s very sweet to watch  she hardly says anything and prem does all the talking being honest with her about his past and the girl he liked and him smoking . then it leads on to them all having a family trip and then that  s when they really do fall for each other . it makes you just want to watch the couple and watch all the sweet moments they have . another factor is that poonam chichi is really mean to her and you feel sorry for poonam because she has been treated bad and makes you want to see her happy and when she finally finds happiness  you too start feeling happy with her the movie basically makes you fall in love with poonam more then just prem . when she finds happiness through prem you want her to stay happy and also hope nothing goes wrong because the character is shown as a sweet simple girl . which brings me to performances and amrita roa as poonam is amazing in the movie  her best work till date you will fall in love with this innocent character and root her on to find happiness . shahid kapoor as prem is amazing too  he is poonam support in the film  he is her happiness the movie  together they share an amazing chemistry and i have never seen a cuter couple since srk and kajol . if ishq vishk didn  t touch you to telling you how cute they are together this surely will .  mujhe haq hai  the song and before that is amazing chemistry they show . scenes which touched me was when prem takes poonam to his room and shows her that  s where they will be staying and he opens her up and they have a moment between them which is too sweet . again if you have ever been in love with someone that much these scenes you can defiantly connect to . the film is just the sweetest thing you will see ever .  br    br   the direction is spot on  to me a good movie is basically something that can pull me in and stop me believe for this hours what is being seen here is fake and there is a camera filing them . to me this film pulled me in and for those three hours i felt really connected to the movie . the songs you will only truly like when you have seen the movie as they are songs placed in the situation after i saw the movie i been playing the songs non stop  the music is

it seems that several of the people who have reviewed this movie only watched it in the first place because it was filmed near where they live . how  s that for a ringing endorsement  if this movie was filmed near where i lived i wouldn  t be mentioning it in my review . it is horrid  several reviews state that this film is a spoof or tongue  in  cheek horror movie  it is neither . it is sad to see this film reviewed as a comedy as that makes it not only a bad attempt at a horror film but as a comedy as well . i did laugh though  at how unbelievably bad the film was .  br    br   this movie has  good things going for it  the mask and the weapon of choice  unfortunately it would have been more interesting watching an hour and a half of the mask and weapon laying on a table then watching this garbage . the social commentary behind the film is also laughable  juvenile and stupid . don  t bother with this movie  you  ve already wasted time reading this review don  t waste anymore on this movie . arrggghhh  it  s infuriating that movies like this even get made . i was expecting the entire cast a crew to be credited to alan smithee  a name used when a person  usually a director  doesn  t want to be credited with a movie because it  s so bad .  br    br   there is nothing redeeming in this movie  i spent   .   on the rental and feel i was ripped off . avoid .  out of    ,0
rich ditzy joan winfield  a woefully miscast bette davis  is engaged to be married to stupid egotistical allen brice  jack carson looking lost  . her father  eugene palette  is determined to stop the marriage and has her kidnapped by pilot steve collins  james cagney . seriously  . they crash land in the desert and hate each other but  sigh  start falling in love .  br    br   this seems to be getting a high rating from reviewers here only because cagney and davis are in it . they were both brilliant actors but they were known for dramas not comedy and this movie shows why  the script is just horrible   there  s not one genuine laugh in the entire movie . the running joke in this has cagney and davis falling rump first in a cactus  this is done three times   . only their considerable talents save them from being completely humiliated . as it is they both do their best with the lousy material . cagney tries his best with his lines and davis screeches every line full force but it doesn  t work . carson has this  what the hell  look on his face throughout the entire movie  probably because his characters emotions change in seconds  . only palette with his distinctive voice and over the top readings manges to elicit a few smiles . but  all in all  this was dull and laughless   a real chore to sit through . this gets two stars only for cagney and davis  acting and some beautiful cinematography but really   it  s not worth seeing . cagney and davis hated this film in later years and you can see why .  ,0
just in time to capitalize on the long  awaited movie version of  dreamgirls  is the dvd release of this semi  forgotten     musical melodrama that also takes the rise of the supremes as its inspiration . released five years before the broadway opening of  dreamgirls  and partially set in the same period  it has a predominantly black cast and a story revolving around an up  and  coming girl group  and that  s where the resemblance basically ends . written by joel schumacher well before he became a big  league director of mainstream studio product   batman forever    the phantom of the opera    this movie seems grittier on the surface . true to form  however  schumacher weakens the storyline and character development by injecting an abundance of clichs and eye  rolling one  liners . with little affinity for staging musical numbers  sam o  steen  a highly regarded film editor but neophyte director  helms the production like a low  budget tv  movie with a frustratingly episodic structure .  br    br   the story follows three harlem sisters  sexy sister  self  righteous delores and sweet sparkle  as they sing in the church choir  meet smooth  talking but well  intentioned boys stix and levi  and then find their first taste of success as a singing group  first as a sweater  wearing quintet called the hearts and then as a glitzy trio known as sister and the sisters . but naturally there are problems beyond the silly name for the group  sister gets involved with nasty drug dealer satin struthers who beats her and turns her into a cocaine junkie levi goes to prison for getting caught in a drug pick  up for satin stix gets frustrated by failure and unwisely turns to some jewish mobsters for financial help delores just gets plain fed up and poor little sparkle has to decide what kind of future she wants . a big plus is that rb great curtis mayfield wrote the atmospheric songs  some catchy and one   look into your heart   a real winner .  br    br   the solid cast does its best under the contrived circumstances . lonette mckee  s valiant attempt to make sister a tragic figure is undercut by some of the ham  fisted plot turns  including a sad billie holliday  like turn at the mike . before they hit it big on primetime tv  philip michael thomas and dorian harewood portray stix and levi with boyish vitality if not much credibility . the best work comes from mary alice in a relatively silent turn as the girls  patient mother and a pre   fame  irene cara who effortlessly exudes sincerity in the title role  though her costumer and hair stylist should be shot for the hideous look she achieves in the final scene  . the dvd just comes with the original theatrical trailer complete with an unctuous voice  over by dj casey kasem and a bonus cd of five of the film  s songs performed not by the original cast but by aretha franklin off her     recording of the soundtrack . it  s not a terrible movie  just an interesting if lacking curio that happens to cover the same ground as  dreamgirls  .  ,0
   slight spoilers    br    br   way back  before evangelion was made  before hideaki anno was an idol and household name for many anime fans  and before gainax had reached the status of fanfavorite  gunbuster was made . with only wings of honneamise made by gainax at that time  and the famous otakon shorts or course  gunbuster had some tough acts to follow up . it didn  t make it easier on itself by picking out a genre that was already done countless times before  space opera .  br    br   luckily  gainax decided to put it out as a six  part oav  direct to video  series . this allows the series to have a bigger scope than would have been possible if it was made into a film . this also prevents it from becoming too boring and overly long  with lots of pointless battles and filler along the way . besides that  they made some effort to stay clear from the tested space opera mechanics used in macross or gundam  and many other popular space operas .  br    br   for one  the shows starts out pretty light  with noriko in the okinawa high school for mechapiloting . noriko is the daughter of a respected ship commander who died in battle  when she was still a little kid . this makes her life at the academy quite hard  as some of her fellow classmates start to suspect that noriko is favored by the professors . the first episode is pretty much a comedy drama  with a very tight focus on the characters and setting of the school . things quickly change when the threat of an alien invasion is announced  and noriko and kazumi  best girl in class  are chosen to help the assembled fleet out .  br    br   the middle bulk of gunbuster leaves our female lead in space  focusing on both personal drama and action . a couple more characters are introduced  and parts of noriko  s past are dragged up again . besides that  the alien threat becomes more imminent every minute  and the gunbuster  mankind  s final hope  is presented . smart as writer okada was  he incorporated the principles of time dilation  to spice things up a bit . in short  time moves slower for those who travel at the speed of light . this means that noriko can be part of a war that takes almost a century to complete . also the dramatic aspect of this is accentuated  when noriko sees her friends again on her return to base  who have aged considerably more than her . the science might not be perfect  but it  s presented in a pretty believable way  with even some sd science theatre shorts in between the episodes  where noriko  kazumi and their coach give a short description of the scientific principles used in the series .  br    br   the animation  for a series made in the   s  is definitely good . the designs are retro   s style of course  but it has it  s charm . animation is fluent enough and the character designs are nice  although the costumes do betray  br    br   some of the fanservice fascination gainax will later exploit to the fullest . the mechas throughout the shows are pretty cool too  with the gunbuster as the ultimate killing machine  strong and vast . the last episode was entirely done in black and white . while it  s generally believed  but not confirmed  that this was done for budget reasons  it lends a whole different atmosphere to the series  which is suited perfectly for the latter part .  br    br   the music is very typical space opera fair . too bombastic in places  very generic  and definitely not worth buying . it does fit the series for the most part  but it can become quite annoying at times . tanaka is not really a famous composer  and the only other respectable series he  s worked on is dragon half . if you think   s anime music  you will know what to expect .  br    br   as the series progresses  the focus slowly shifts from drama to space opera to epic battle  but in such a way the viewer will hardly notice this . step by step the drama will be toned down  and the battles will take the front row . neither aspect is ever left completely out though . with the last episode in sight  noriko and crew are fighting for the further existence of human kind  and with the last battle in sight  certain questions are presented to the audience  concerning to position of the human race in the galaxy  and how far it can go to guarantee self  preservation . while they are never answered later on  they still present some interesting food for thought . the last episode is very epic  with a nice  but quite predictable ending  though not all endings should contain numerous outlandish twists of course . again  it fits the series .  br    br   gunbuster may sound like your average space opera anime at first  with alien invasions  huge battles  and some personal drama  and for the bigger part  it is . but it is done exceptionally well for a change . instead of going for a steady mix of former elements  six episodes long  gunbuster presents us a change from small scale drama to large scale epic heroism . along the way we meet with some various interesting and well fleshed  out characters  which mutual relationships changing heavily due to the time dilation phenomenon . the show is very tightly written  although it does tend to slip up at some points . overly dramatic occurrences and too cheesy mecha attacks could have been easily avoided . overall  the trip gunbuster takes you on is a very relaxed  sometimes sad  sometimes heroic one . it might not have shattered the boundaries and limits of the space opera genre  but at least it bend them a little . highly enjoyable anime classic  but not without flaws .  br    br

not a movie for everyone  but this movie is in my top   . i am a lover of black comedy . with a cast including richard dreyfus  vic   jeff goldblum  mick   larry bishop  nick  and gabriel byrne  ben  brass balls  london  in the leads  the lines can  t help but be dry . the supporting cast is nearly dead center . counting the minor flaws in the movie ellen barkin  s make  up gave her face has a washed out look there were a couple of gimme cameos by joey bishop and richard pryor that served no purpose  and michael j . pollard  s screen time was too short . over all  the cast was just incredible without egos to wreck a fine script . if you have seen larry bishop  s  writer  director  film  underworld  a dark crime flick   you will enjoy this one . his next outing  writer  director  actor  is hell ride with michael madsen and quentin tarantino .  ,1
this movie is perfect for families to watch together . it is a great film and it deserves more credit . the special effects are stunning and spectacular . everyone who has children should share this with theirs .  ,1
der todesking is not one of my favorite jorg buttgereit film  but still is an interesting film dealing with suicide and it  s reasons and ramifications . those looking for a gore  fest  or exploitation in the style of the nekromantik films or schramm will probably be disappointed . der todesking is definitely an  art  house  style film  so those that need linear  explainable narratives need not apply . . .  br    br   the basic concept of der todesking is that there is an  episode  for each day of the week that revolves around a strange chain letter that apparently causes people to commit suicide  interspersed with scenes of a slowly decomposing corpse . . .  br    br   there are some very well done and thought provoking scenes  including the man talking about the  problems  with his wife  and the concert massacre  which unfortunately lost some of it  s  power  on me  because i was too busy laughing at the scorpions look  alike band on stage . . .  . but seriously  this is a sometimes beautiful  the scene that shows different angles of that huge bridge is particularly effective  especially if you understand the significance of the scene  and that the names shown are of people that actually committed suicide from jumping from the bridge . . .   sometimes confusing  sometimes silly  the she wolf of the ss rip  off is pretty amusing   sometimes harrowing  i found the scene of the guy talking to the girl in the park about his wife particularly effective  film that is more of an  experience  then just entertainment  as many of these  art  films are meant to be . still  i didn  t find der todesking to be as strong as nekromantik or schramm  and would probably put it on relatively even footing with nekromantik  in terms of my personally  enjoyment level  . definitely worth a look to any buttgereit or  art  film fan . if you dig this type of film  check out subconscious cruelty  in my opinion the best art  house  horror film that i  ve seen .     for der todesking  ,1
i  ve seen the thin man series   powell and loy are definitely great  but there is something awfully sweet about powell and arthur  s chemistry in this flick . jean arthur shines when she looks at powell . there is an unmistakable undercurrent buzzing between them . this film may not have the wit of the thin man series  but undeniably makes up for it in charm . while i watched it  i thought for sure powell was carrying on an off  screen affair with arthur . my friends thought the same . this is one film where i wish i could step back in time  to schmooze and lock lips with powell   there seems to be no end to his lovable playful smirks  powell  s character  lawrence bradford  is probably the closest thing to the  perfect man .  okay  this is sounding way too gushy  but i can  t help myself .  ,1
 . . . but the trouble of this production is that it  s very far from a good musical .  br    br   granted  one can  t always expect the witty masters like sondheim or bernstein or porter yet the music of this piece makes even andrew lloyd webber look witty . it  s deadly dull and uninventive  with one or two exceptions  and just after i watched it i couldn  t recall a single significant melody  which is rather tragic coming from someone who learned the whole another hundred people from three listenings .  br    br   it is also strangely un  theatrical . it takes place on an incredibly large stage  one really has to feel sorry for those people in front rows who broke their necks in order to see something happening   meters on the right or    meters on the left  and does absolutely nothing with it . when there  s supposed to be one person singing on  stage  that  s just what you get  and the rest of the enormeous stage is empty . for me as an aspiring theatre director it was almost painful to watch .  br    br   the fact remains  cole porter seems to have captured the french culture in his works better than these no  talents can ever come close to . and i  m puzzled by the popularity of this would  be  legendary musical .  ,0
this self  indulgent mess may have put the kibosh on mr . branagh  s career as an adapter of shakespeare for the cinema .  released  years ago not a peep of an adaptation since .  i just finished watching this on cable   holy god  it  s terrible .  br    br   i agree with the sentiment of a reviewer below who said that reviewing something so obviously and sadly awful is an ungenerous act that comes across as shrill . that being said  i  ll take the risk  if only because love  s labour  s lost is the perfect reward for those who overrated mr . branagh  s directorial abilities in the past . branagh has always been a pretty lousy director grindingly literal  minded star  struck unforgivably ungenerous to his fellow actors  he loves his american stars  but loves himself more  making damn sure that he gets all the good lines  .  br    br   along those lines  the sad fact remains that love  s labour  s lost is scarcely worse than the interminable  ghastly  bloated hamlet from     . in fact  this film may be preferable  if only because it  s about    the length . branagh decided it would be a good idea to update this bad early work of shakespeare  s to the milieu of cole porter  george gershwin  fred astaire  yada yada . so he sets the thing in      leaves about an eighth of the text intact in favor of egregious interpretations of thirties  standards  wait till you see the actors heaved up on wires toward the ceiling during  i  m in heaven    and casts actors not known for their dancing or singing  himself included  . the result is a disaster so surreal that one is left dumbfounded that they just didn  t call a horrified stop to the whole thing after looking at the first dailies . i don  t even blame the cast . to paraphrase hamlet   the screenplay  s the thing   no one could possibly come off well in this hodge  podge the illustrious rsc alumni fare no better than alicia silverstone . who could possibly act in this thing   br    br   branagh  s first mistake was in thinking that love  s labour  s lost was a play worth filming . trust me  it isn  t . it  s an anomaly in the bard  s canon  written expressly for an educated coterie of courtiers   not the usual audience for which he wrote . hence  there  s a lot of precious  and tedious   word  play  references to contemporary scholastic nonsense  parodies of lyly  s euphues . . . in other words  hardly the sort of material to appeal to a broad audience . hell  it doesn  t appeal to an audience already predisposed to shakespearean comedy . the play cannot be staged without drastically cutting the text and desperately  updating  it with any gimmick that comes to hand . which begs the question  why bother   br    br   branagh  s second mistake was in thinking that shakespeare  s cream  pie of a play could be served with a side  order of gershwin  s marmalade . clearly the idea  or hope  was to make an unintelligible elizabethan exercise palatable for modern audiences by administering nostalgic american pop culture down their throats at the same time . but again  this begs the question  why bother   br    br    ,0
i have never seen a worse movie .  br    br   it is possible to take a shootem up video game and make it into a decent movie .  br    br   mistake   absolutely no connection to any of the characters . in this movie you don  t bond with any of the characters because . . . you don  t get a chance .  br    br   the only character that is sympathetic or even interesting is the deck hand salish as played by clint howard . except for this unique character  the outcome of the movie is meaningless as all the characters were lifeless from the begining .  br    br   mistake   the worst gunfight scene ever . i love gunfights . i love when the heros open up on the badguys and clean house . heck i even like to watch a badguy clean house sometimes . but this gunfight was weird i guess that the best way to describe it is  apathetic  i  ve seen people shoot with more feeling and emotion while playing the videogame . in this movie it looked and felt like the  actors  were simply walking through shooting everything that moved without emotion .  br    br   why  where  s the trash talking  where  s the snarls of rage amongst the gunfire  these are supposed to be kids that got caught at a rave gone bad . . . but even real soldiers acting professionally and ruthlessly show their humanity .  br    br   if you want a good horror movie about a secluded house full of monsters  i recomend sam rami  s evil dead series . do not see the disaster that is house of the dead . i hope that they burn the master and all copies of this movie .  ,0
i guess this goes to prove that joe don baker will do anything for a buck . the concept of the film wasn  t very good to start with . this movie has so many bad things about it i don  t know where to start . the acting is horrible . the cinematography is marginal at best . the soundtrack was pretty bad . the score is terrible . there  s a reason why this movie ended up on mystery science theater     . i voted before i wrote this and i cannot believe that  people actually thought this  film  is excellent . they must have liked the two go  go dancers . final justice would be if they locked this stinker in the film vault outside wichita and never let anyone see it again  a  out of   rating is far better than this deserves .  ,0
oh man  why   six degrees  is a show about this so called theory that we all are linked by someone . if focus on the lives of a group of people and the consequences of their actions .  br    br   when i first heard of this show  it didn  t caught my attention at all . it seemed too ordinary  actually . then  i saw some episodes . . . and loved it  first of all  the characters . they are all well  written and different from each other . there  s a alcohol addicted  a woman whose fiance cheats on her  a woman who just lost her husband  a driver who has a troubled brother and so on . . . unlike what we  re used to  most of the characters interact with each other in casualties  like in our daily routines . great  my favourite ones are mae  carlos and whitney .  br    br   then  the cast . they are all great . jay hernandez  from  hostel   shows here his acting habilities in a more  d character than his previous work as paxton . the other ones give great performances too  specially campbell scott  who plays steven and bridget moynahan  who plays whitney .  br    br   well when i came to imdb  after watching some episodes  i couldn  t believe that it got cancelled . seriously  i can  t understand the low ratings .  br    br   it  s too bad it didn  t have more than one season . it would really be a good show to follow   ,1
although there is melodrama at the center or rather at the bottom of this film  the story is told beautifully and subtly and the acting is superb .  br    br   yaara  studying at princeton  returns to her native israel for the funeral of her oldest and dearest friend  talia . because yaara practically lived with her friend  s parents after the death of her own mother  she has lost her adoptive sister . and because yaara  blind from birth  has been guided and guarded by talia  her friend  s suicide is as unbearable as it is inexplicable .  br    br   inevitably  the blind girl is the one who determines to solve the mystery of this death . though without sight  she has insight . though she cannot see  she is able to find what is out of sight than the  normal  people around her . the film thus becomes an absorbing mystery as yaara scours for clues in memories of her relationship with talia  in her adoptive family  s house  in tapes  diaries  and people in talia  s past and present .  br    br   told from yara  s point of view  the film is also seen from her point of view  as she visualizes what she hears  believes  and imagines . the solution to the mystery is rather conventional  but the search is conducted with such subtle care and the answer rendered so beautifully and without fanfare  that the pat moment is easily forgiven . the truths emerge gradually yet inexorably  clarifying not only talia  s life  but also her relationship with yaara . tali sharon  as yaara  uses her mobile face and voice effectively  and is utterly believable as both the adult and teenage girl . we accept fully her ability by the film  s end to find her place in the world more confidently .  br    br   noteworthy is the precision by which places and actions are repeated with small but significant variations that never become tedious  the dead  on acting by the minor characters  and the interesting decision to represent talia only as a teenager . i will quibble with yaara  s final declaration as stands with gadi  talia  s last boyfriend  at a cliff  s edge  but that trip to the edge is so fascinating that the image will remain in sight longer than her words will be recalled .  ,1
roman polanski masterfully directs this sort of a variation on the same theme as repulsion . i can  t imagine there is one honest movie goer not able to acknowledge the fine director in le locataire  yet both parts of the dyptic may not be thoroughly satisfactory to most people  myself included .  br    br   polanski is very good at making us feels the inner torture of his characters  deneuve in repulsion and himself in le locataire   starting with some lack of self  assurance soon to turn gradually into psychological uneasiness eventually blossoming into an irreversible physical malaise . the shared ordeal for the characters and audience is really dissimilar from the fright and tension of horror movies since there  s no tangible supernatural element here . while horror movies allow for some kind of catharsis  be it cheap or more elaborate  polanski sadistically tortures us and  if in his latter opus the dark humour is permanent  we are mostly on our nerves as opposed to on the edge of our seats .  br    br   suspense  horror  all this is a matter of playing with the audience  s expectations  alternatively fooling and fulfilling them   not literally with people  s nerves . in my book rosemary  s baby is a far greater achievement because sheer paranoia and plain rationality are in constant struggle the story is about a couple moving in a strange flat  while we are forced to identify with a sole character . what  s more if the fantasy elements are all in the hero  s mind the situation is most uncomfortable since we  the viewers  are compelled to judge him  reject him while we have been masterfully lured   paint  n lure   into being him .  ,1
like another reviewer said  this movie is not a heavy melodrama  but it deals with harsh realities . a very very playful movie that does not dwell for a moment . some very good acting and some wonderful smiles as well .  ,1
this is very dated  but that  s part of the charm with this     movie . you can say the same for most pre  code films they  re just different  and usually in an interesting way .  br    br   it was the short running time  the great acting of spencer tracy and the beautiful face and sweetness of loretta young  s character which kept me watching and enjoying this stagy  but  intriguing film .  br    br   you  d be hard  pressed to find a nicer girl than  trinna   played by the    year  old young who was already into making her   th movie   she started acting as a small child . that  and the fact they made movies quickly back in the old days .  the camera  although in soft focus throughout much of the film  zoomed in on loretta  s face and eyes many times and i was mesmerized by her beauty .  br    br   playing a crotchety man with a cynical outlook on life  tracy  s  bill  slowly transformed into a loving man  thanks to trinna . spencer delivered his lines here with such naturalness that you hardly knew he was acting .  br    br   although they have small roles  supporting actors walter connolly  marjorie rambeau  arthur hohl and glenda farrell leave lasting impressions long after viewing this    minute film . i was particularly fascinated with connolly  s role as the minister  father figure of the camp .  br    br   the story is a little far  fetched but  hey  that  s the movies . this story is about two lonely great depression victims trying to survive in a  hooverville   type camp and it winds up to be a very touching tale .  ,1
as long as you go into this movie knowing that it  s terrible bad acting  bad  effects   bad story  bad . . . everything  then you  ll love it . this is one of my favorite  goof on  movies watch it as a comedy and have a dozen good laughs   ,1
bloodsuckers has the potential to be a somewhat decent movie  the concept of military types tracking down and battling vampires in space is one with some potential in the cheesier realm of things . even the idea of the universe being full of various different breeds of vampire  all with different attributes  many of which the characters have yet to find out about  is kind of cool as well . as to how most of the life in the galaxy outside of earth is vampire  i  m not sure how the makers meant for that to work  given the nature of vampires . who the hell they are meant to be feeding on if almost everyone is a vampire i don  t know . as it is the movie comes across a low budget mix of firefly  serenity and vampires movies with a dash of aliens .  br    br   the action parts of the movie are pretty average and derivative  particularly of serenity  but passable  they are reasonably well executed and there is enough gore for a vampire flick  including some of the comical blood  spurting variety . there is a lot of character stuff  most of which is tedious  coming from conflicts between characters who mostly seem like whiny  immature arseholes  primarily cowboy dude and asian woman . there are a few character scenes that actually kind of work and the actors don  t play it too badly but it mostly slows things down . a nice try at fleshing the characters out but people don  t watch a movie called bloodsuckers for character development and drama . the acting is actually okay . michael ironside hams it up and is as fun to watch as ever and at least of a couple of the women are hot . the space sfx aren  t too bad for what is clearly a low budget work . the story is again pretty average and derivative but as i said the world created has a little bit of potential . the way things are set up bloodsuckers really does seem like the pilot for a tv series  character dynamics introduced  the world introduced but not explored  etc .  br    br   the film does have a some highlights and head scratching moments  the kind of stuff that actually makes these dodgy productions watchable .  the scene where our heroes interrogate a talking sock puppet chestburster type creature . hilarious .  the  sex scene .  wtf indeed .  the credit  and michael ironside as muco .  the most annoying aspect of it all though is the really awful and usually inappropriate pop music they have playing very loud over half the scenes of the movie . it is painful to listen to and only detracts from what is only average at best .  br    br   basically an okay watch is you  re up for something cheesy  even if it is just for the  chestburster  scene .  ,0
here is one of those movies spoiled by the studio  s insistence on a happy ending . conflicts which have stretched out for years are settled in a few minutes . it would have been far more interesting to inject a tone of ambiguity . the talented barbara stanwyck is undone by a sudden metamorphosis from independent and assertive woman to a compliant female of the kind she has put down all her life . brent  as usual  is well over his head and then there is the ludicrous situation of gig young playing a character named gig young . someone mentions  gig young  and then who appears but gig young  the actor  worth seeing though far below what it could have been .  ,0
i have never commented on a film before . i watched this movie with my girlfriend last night . i  ve read comments saying this movie stays with you . it does . it  s been almost   hours and i am still completely affected . this movie left me questioning my own self . how can i possibly compare myself to a character such as ben who is totally selfless . i loved this movie . i love movies that keep me guessing and wondering until the end . i feel two emotions predominantly  happiness and sadness . an amazing feel good movie and a very sad one too . i so wanted ben and emily to be together  but in the end  they were  forever . if you haven  t seen this movie  get it and watch it . just make sure you have no distractions . you  ll want to see every nuance in this picture . one for my library .  ,1
  simple rules for dating my teenage daughter had an auspicious start . the supremely  talented tom shadyac was involved in the project . this meant that the comedy would be nothing less of spectacular  and that  s exactly what happened the show remains one of the freshest  funniest  wittiest shows made in a very long time . every line  facial expression  casting choice  scene  all wreaked of perfection . there was not one episode after which i thought   man that wasn  t as good as the rest  . each one was a standout . again  this is the kind of perfectionism that we  ve come to expect from tom . for those who don  t know  tom shadyac is the director of ace ventura  first movie   the nutty professor  first one  and liar liar . quite a rsum . he  s a producer here not a

t fall in love with katey when she played peg on married with children  al bundy was our hero . we viewers gave him the respect and love he never had . but without peg  s nonchalant  parasitic  lazy lifestyle  al would  ve probably been just another chicago dad instead of the mess that peg  life  actually  caused him to be . katey was a milf back then and still is a brune now  instead of a redhead  and just as buxom as ever . cate is the conservative mom and loving wife . i know it sounds boring  but comedically  she fits perfectly .  br    br   the ditzy blonde daughter bridget  played to perfection by kaley cuoco   almost never has an idiot been played so well . aside of gob on arrested development  bridget may well be a shoe  in for any awards given to this archetype . bridget is shallow  self  centered  not very bright and a tad slutty in his look . she plays the dumb blonde role better than absolutely anyone imo . perfection . one of the high  points of the show .  br    br   the overlooked geeky daughter kerry  amy davidson   a brune and a geek  she gets no love from life or circumstances . feels overlooked  under  appreciated and neglected most of the time . she  s bridget  s younger sister  in reality she  s older than her  and the two  s extremely opposite personalities and brains cause endless clashes  to much of our amusement .  br    br   the son rory  martin spanjers   was the second funniest character imo before the passing of ritter  then john passes  new characters come and rory is not the wise  cracking verbal  trouble  maker that he used to that went mostly to david spade  s character .  br    br   those characters were the main ones at the time of john ritter . unfortunately enough  the insanely hilarious larry miller  one of my favorites  did not get lots of screen time . he played paul  s co  worker  competitor . after an aortic dissection cost ritter his life in      september   th   the show was on hiatus for a while . no one thought it could come back  but it did later on  with a couple of new additions . this began the second phase of the show  and the new characters were  br    br   the strict  confident school principal ed  adam arkin   i saw adam here and there on talk shows . this was the first time that i saw him do anything . impressed  is the word i use . his performance was very impressive . sad he wasn  t brought in earlier . he also plays cate  s potential love interest after paul passes . the gradual progress towards this point  which would  ve sounded crazy at the beginning  earns the creators lots of praise . it was done slowly  carefully and excellently  with constant respect paid to the paul  ritter  .  br    br   the attitude grandpa jim egan  james garner   a surprisingly welcome addition to the series  he was cannon fodder for endless  old  jokes  mainly by . . .  br    br   the    year  old unemployed wise  cracking half  brother of the mom cj  played to insanely funny heights by david spade   i knew spade was funny  i just didn  t know he was this funny . somehow  spade  s very familiar presence is sensed inside his character  as opposed to a separable character   which is understandable  since he  s a comic and he  s on a comedy show . this eerie feeling is kinda like seeing someone borrow lots of material from david spade  s appearances in movies  talk shows and functions  award shows  etc .  and delivering a superb impersonation of spade  s voice and comedy style  except  that it is spade . by that i mean you realize he  s not trying to play someone else  or a whole new character he  s being the goofy  funny spade we  ve come to know  and he takes this pleasantly humorous formula to the absolute top . every line he uttered  every sarcasm he begot  all classics  literally . spade was crazy  funny so  so funny .  br    br   the show  s humor and drama were both upped after the show was back  but audiences thought   john passed  it ain  t gonna be the same anymore  . this is understandable  considering we are talking about a group of people  american viewers  who gave  yes dear  a free ride but caused andy richter controls the universe to be cancelled in no time . as the show  s quality increased  its ratings declined . soon it was no more  sadly .  br    br   and i saved the best for last fans of married with children are in for a treat . and boy  what a treat it was . i still shiver just remembering it . it  s a surprise so good that it would be crazy for me to spoil it  even if i legitimately do it under the  spoiler . . .  pretext . suffice it to say that it  s something you  ll never forget . i know i won  t     ,1
i love zombie  movies and i love amateur  productions . and meat market  starts really promising with a nice homage to fulcis classic  zombi  .  br    br   so i leaned back and waited to be impressed . okay  some of the makeups are great for such a no budget movie and some actors  the vampirelady and the cook  really stand out  but else theres nothing .  br    br   i didnt expect a new romero here but there is not one sequence in the whole movie which has even a little bit of suspense or shock value . the director sure knows how to stage body rippings and interesting eating habits  but now  after two parts  its time to learn something more .  br    br   in meatmarket  gore rhymes with bore  for me thats not enough  sorry .  br    br    out of   ,0
i like my ronald colman dashing and debonair  the fellow you see in such films as if i were king and kismet . i like him as the epitome of civilization as in the lost horrizon and random harvest . a brooding colman isn  t a favorite of mine .  br    br   but in a double life precisely because his part as actor anthony john is so offbeat for him  colman was recognized with a best actor oscar for     . it became his best known part .  br    br   colman is an actor who really does take the method quite seriously . he  s just finished a successful run in a comedy of manners and he  s quite the jovial fellow . for a change of pace now that that play has concluded its broadway run  colman is bringing a revival of othello to new york . about as opposite a part as you can get .  br    br   his leading lady in both is his former wife signe hasso who loves him dearly  but can  t take his change of moods when he  s at work . colman loves her dearly as well and wants her back . but he  s heading for a mental breakdown when he starts confusing himself with the jealous moor othello and hasso with her role as desdemona .  br    br   unfortunately shelley winters as a poor waitress who a depressed colman picks up gets in the way of his madness and she winds up like poor desdemona in the play . killed in the same manner and now it  s a matter for homicide cop joe sawyer .  br    br   colman  s performance is so good that one does kind of wonder is this an occupational hazard with actors  i  d shudder to think so  were there any unsolved homicides in or around laurence olivier and orson welles then they essayed othello .  br    br   i could never quite buy the story for that reason  but i certainly do applaud ronald colman and what he did with the part . i  m sure there was a tinge of regret in him winning the oscar though because one of the other nominees was his good friend william powell for life with father . others in the running that year were gregory peck for gentlemen  s agreement  john garfield for body and soul  and michael redgrave for mourning becomes electra .  br    br   colman gets able support from the rest of the cast including edmond o  brien who finds himself in the unwanted part of cassio in colman  s jealous fantasy . still you will find no iago equivalent in a double life  no one prodding the jealousy  it  s all in his own mind .  br    br   and that from one of the most cultivated and civilized minds of the last century .  ,1
i first watched this movie on its release in     and was greatly affected emotionally  through a combination of guilt at what my fellow white human beings could do to innocent people and the reluctance of the outside world to really investigate these atrocities against man .  br    br   particularly moving was the funeral of steve biko  made even more vivid and hard  hitting by the south african anthem played at the time . i have long believed that this movie achieved what nobody else had managed  to open the eyes of the world to what was really happening in south africa . i consider myself to be a normal right thinking person and i can attest to how this film changed my whole way of thinking about not just south africa  but how we as white people perceive black people . i have never seen any difference between people of any colour or creed  but after viewing this film i physically changed my life and have spent the last   years living in a predominantly black country and helping many people rise above their present standard of living and achieve that which they would not have thought possible . the greatest reward i can honestly say i have received  to be able to say that in my own small way i have contributed and redressed the balance a little . but if more people thought like me and actually did something to help black people without seeking reward then the entire black population of this planet would be a little better off .  br    br   i challenge any right thinking person to watch cry freedom from beginning to end and not feel that emotion tugging at your heartstrings as you witness the    schoolchildren brutally shot dead in sharpville for refusing to learn afrikaans  the senseless murder of steve biko  such a champion for his own people  s rights  and then  ultimately  to understand that all this is not merely a film  albeit a magnificent one  but that it all actually happened and less than   years ago .  br    br   yes  my friends  watch this movie and then see if you can go out afterwards and party hard . i couldn  t . i was too upset at knowing the truth . that is the hallmark of a great film . it was obviously the intention of sir richard attenborough to get this message over about south africa . of course he has achieved it . unless you happen to support apartheid . god help you .  ,1
sorry  i don  t have much time to write . i am not a psychologist but have known one for   years . she said that scott wilson portrayed a sociopath  no conscience  extraordinarily well . i agree  she also said that robert blake portrayed a person with anger and impulse control who had a conscience but couldn  t control himself superbly . i agree  what a chilling and tremendous film . i have seen over     films and would rank this in the top    . my lifelong friend deals with clients such as these regularly . my only criticism was the preachy narration at the end of the film . many people grow up in less than ideal circumstances but only one in a million will behave as these  losers did .  ,1
the only time i have seen this movie was when i was   years old . i have remembered it all of these years as i couldn  t sleep for a week or more after seeing it . it just absolutely rattled me . i was on vacation with my aunts in ft . worth  texas and i will never forget it . now    years later  my daughter is trying to get a copy of this for me to view as an adult . it has taken a lot of research to find out what movie it was but i always remembered that barbara stanwyck was in it and finally was able to get the name and reviews on it . i very much enjoyed it  but it gave me quite a scare  jaqui  ,1
so this is what actress kim basinger has succumbed to  mmm to tell the truth the film  s title is something quite eye grabbing to getting your interest and plot outline reads so basic  but simplicity can have its strengths . anyhow by the end of  while she was out  i was left feeling rather indifferent . not the worse  despite being engulfed by negatives   but there  s easily way better in what is an causally lukewarm  but compact and unbalanced late  night survival fable of a feeble suburban housewife stranded in the woods trying to fight for her life after she witnessed the death of a rent a cop that came to her aid  when she provoked an ugly exchange with some punks in a shopping car park .  br    br   the problem here falls on the misguidedly erratic and foreseeable material  taken from a short story   along with the very variable performances . the flimsy script was poorly thought  out  which isn  t so good when your plot has a slight structure to hang off   so many wretched inclusions and dubious actions just go on to find its way in this endless chain of events . as for the bunch of stereotypical goons  led by an unconvincing lukas hass as a loose canon  terrorizing basinger  well they were less than threatening  but hopelessly clueless . watching basinger scrounging around in the dank wilderness with a red tool box in her hand  don  t ask me why   knocking off these wannabe punks one by one became ridiculous because it didn  t elicit tension or emotion but instead clumsy jolts that were absurdly daft because of the stupidity of the lead up . basinger  s performance is stout  like  but doesn  t craft much empathy . craig sheffer shows up as her hot  headed husband . strangely i couldn  t keep my eyes off the screen thinking to myself that red toolbox is hypnotic  why would she be constantly carrying it  and what tool was she going to use to dispatch the next thug her choices were quite disappointing . watching her transformation through the traumatic situation when things are finally turned around is rather empty  due to its unsure tone and the ending is something you could see miles ahead .  br    br   susan montford  s soberly slick direction lacks cohesion and energy  as it pretty much chugs along . i liked the opening credits though  with its hauntingly sullen score  which is the most effective thing throughout the feature  and polished photography .  br    br   no great shakes . doesn  t ask much of your time  but i wouldn  t care to see it again . however with the inclusion of a joy division song  it made me grab a couple of their albums for a listen .  ,0
there have been some funny movies about spirits to come out of hollywood . cary grant was an angel in  the bishop  s wife        . of course the best were the topper movies in the late    s  early    s . and  more recently  warren beatty  s  heaven can wait         which was a remake of      s  here comes mr . jordan .  these were well  written  funny  entertaining comedies  all of which centered around supernatural creatures like ghosts and angels .  br    br   now comes writer  director jeff lowell  making his feature film debut with a story of an unlikable  bitchy young woman  kate  eva longoria parker   who gets killed on her wedding day and then comes back to harass the fledgling spiritualist  ashley  lake bell  who is falling for kate  s fianc  henry  paul rudd  . one thing that is clear at the outset longoria parker is no constance bennett  marion kerby in the first two  topper  films   who is the standard against whom all female ghosts are measured .  br    br   there is a line right at the beginning when henry  s sister  chloe  lindsay sloane  tells henry   you don  t smile .  that aptly described my situation throughout this film .  br    br   the main problem with the film is that the script just isn  t very funny . but it  s made worse by longoria parker  s presence that just rubbed me the wrong way every time she appeared on the screen . just to start out with  compounding her lack of comedic talent  she is covered with so much pancake makeup  who knows what she really looks like  kate gets killed while setting up for her wedding by a falling frozen statue . she  s so unreasonable that the angel who instructs her about what her afterlife is about walks out on her  well  she actually just fades out   so kate finds herself back on earth as a ghost without knowing what her mission is .  br    br   chloe wants henry to snap out of the funk into which he has naturally descended after kate  s death  from what i saw of kate  he should have felt a wonderful relief   so she introduces him to ashley  who really doesn  t know what she  s doing as a spiritualist  she is also a cateress to make ends meet   to see if she can get henry back in touch with kate . there  s a lot of meshugaas that goes on .  br    br   the vacuity of the film is epitomized by a  b  story revolving around ashley  s assistant  dan  jason biggs  . this is thrown in near the end  but the way ashley handles it indicates that she  s as much of a boob as kate . since dan is apparently attracted to both of these severely flawed women  he deserves whatever he gets .  br    br   eventually kate appears to ashley and the fun should begin . it doesn  t  and more  s the pity because in other hands this could have been pretty funny . as it is  norman z . mcleod  constance bennett  roland young  alan mowbray  and co . must be turning over in their graves to see this is what their brilliance in the first two  topper  films has wrought .  ,0
every once in a while in the wonderful world of horror  diamonds are crafted  and one becomes completely awestruck by its sheer brilliance . this is no less than a diamond   this is a film brimful of eeriness  chilling anticipation  and dark atmosphere  and i think it  s safe to say  one of my favourite horror films of all time  and of course it contains probably the single most  flat out scary sequence in the whole of history of horror  every time i see the film  and it gets up to the point where you know the inevitably will happen  i try to remember exactly when i will be frightened out of my wits  but it never fails to happen i never get it right  and i find myself as terrorized as the first time i saw it   now  it must be said  to scare a jaded horror fan like that  that is nothing short of pure perfection . unlike the americans  the brits know their subtleties  they take pride in the art of acting  they do not need any special effect in order to convey atmosphere  they rely on the power of the potent story  and the creepiness  in this case  of suggestion and anticipation . every single element is impeccable  from the set pieces  the acting  the story  to the menacing atmosphere . pauline moran surely could make the devil whimper  that  s for sure   as an end note  if you for some demented reason don  t like this piece of insanity  then you honestly don  t know what horror is all about  and frankly do not deserve to know it either . thank you   ,1
contains spoilers  also  my quotes may not be exact .  br    br   everyone always notes the satire in social commentary and economic parallels  how true . but to me  i see this movie as much more than that . i love the symbolism of this guy in a glowing white suit . there is so much confusion and filth in the world around him  but it won  t stick . alec guiness was the perfect guy to play this  his boyish grins and eternal curiousity are so appropriate  br    br    that  s ingenious  can you tell me  what is the ratio of ink to petrol    br    br   the only moment of defeat is when he realizes that his invention hasn  t worked after all  standing there almost naked . yet  more than shame is the simple disappointment that  it didn  t work .  he  s never really intimidated by people . remember   br    br    but sidney  we want to stop it too .   br    br   barely a moments hesitation before he  s off trying to get away again . does he show any sign of the pain such a betrayal must  ve caused  no .  br    br   also notable is dapne  s role . she is sick and tired of money and power . she thinks she  s finally found love  outside of her father  s company . at first she doesn  t really care about sidney anymore than anyone else . but that moment when he falls off her car and she goes back to see if maybe she killed him  and yet he is still thinking only of the beauty of his invention . she  s finally found something she thinks is worth living for . the funny thing is that it  s not even romance . it is friendship  but of such an ephemeral nature that the title almost doesn  t fit . it  s more admiration  and perhaps even inspiration .  br    br   upon her discovery that michael has no real love for her  and that her father is completely incompetent to take care of her  she gives into cynicism and tries to temp sidney . fortunately she finds that there really are people in this world living for more than power  money and lust . what a refreshment  br    br    thank you sidney . if you would  ve said  yes  i think i  d have strangled you .   br    br   i love the very end  when all of this crazy business seems to have come to nothing . but then  the bubbly  quirky beat starts up and sidney goes off  his stride matching the tune dauntless . where is daphne  we don  t really know  but they weren  t really in love and she wasn  t really a scientist . he got help escaping and she got  a shot in the arm of hope .   pollyanna  a cont  d relationship would  ve been nice  but as billy joel says  it  s more than i  d hoped for . . .   br    br    ,1
white fire has so much going for it . with larry bird look  alike robert ginty leading the charge blazing away with his fabulous hair and super macho mustache  the movie soars above other low  budget actioners . the charisma he has in this makes tom selleck look like a putz . with ginty beating up everyone  the movie only rises in awesomeness when a story of diamond intrigue enters into play . then add in fred williamson  some frontal bush  chainsaw attacks and some awesome incest themes . . . . this flick ends up delivering on all cylinders . if you  re looking for some awesome b  action  this is where it  s at . now  if i can just get my hands on that soundtrack .  ,1
this is such a great film  never mind the low rating here . i really have no idea where that came from  they must be discussing a different film then . because i absolutely loved it and found it to be a little hidden treasure .  br    br   it  s story was so original and charming . . i really can  t think of anything bad to say about it . maybe it has to be   your type of thing    but  i saw this with my sister and my mother  and we all were taken by it .  br    br   the acting was also very good  and that is hard to do in a film like this . but i found all the characters very intriguing and sympathetic .  br    br   i  ve always been very fond of dougray scott and found his new   dark   role very interesting . it is really awful hard to get me to like a bad guy  but i absolutely had no problem with that this time . even more so  i adored him .  br    br   everyone who loves a good thriller  drama that also has a good dose of love and tragedy should definitely go see this film  no question about that  anyone wanting to see a film with    bloodshed  should go rent something else  though . . but i guess the title already kind of gives that away . this is a love story  not saw  .  br    br   i give this film  out of five stars    good job     br    br   xxx enjoy   ,1

five deadly venoms is not as bloody and violent as story of ricky or super ninjas  but it features some of the best hand  to  hand fight sequences in hong kong film history . director chang cheh creates what is considered by many to be his masterpiece . this movie launched the careers of the five men who play the venoms . meng lo plays yet another bad ass . he would go on to be in super ninjas . kuo chui who is philip kwok would go on to story of ricky and hard boiled . any chop socky fan can apperciate this . but i still think it ain  t as good as super ninjas  also made by chang cheh  . but all chop socky is good and this is one of the very best .  ,1
  land of plenty  is not a film . it is a tombstone for the directorial career of german director wim wenders .  br    br   many felt it in  the million dollar hotel  and now  land of plenty  makes it perfectly clear not only has wenders lost it  he  s actually turned into a bad director  creating horribly weak and superficial stories and scenes .  br    br   one might argue that the  time you lose it  comes for every director  but wenders  case is extreme . it  s as if he completely forget everything he knew about cinema and started all over again  only to get sloppish results .  br    br   in a few words  this film does not deserve your time .  ,0
boring children  s fantasy that gives joan plowright star billing but little to do . sappy kids pursue their dreams . frankie wants to be a ballerina and a baseball player  yuk  while best  friend hazel runs for mayor    she  s    totally pedestrian in every way  plus the added disadvantage of syrupy performances by the girls as well as the baseball boys . certainly a lesser effort for showtime    no limits   ,0
this movie is really bad . the acting is plain awful except michael ironside . i don  t get the story . richard grieco is the only survivor after a fight between two mc  gangs . he comes to a town and suddenly he is choosened to fight against the bad people who wants indian  land . at the cover it said he was a indian himself that returned too his home  town  i didn  t hear that in the movie  if so it wasn  t clear .  br    br   richard grieco was one hell of a bad actor . stiff and ugly . he said his lines like it too . and we wouldn  t talk about sean young  she hasn  been any of my favourite actors but in this movie she plays a indian women who falls in love with bolt  grieco  . she is awful .  br    br   when i rented it i choosed between this and subterfuge with amanda pays . i choosed this one because of michael ironside was in the cast . maybe i should have taken subterfuge .  br    br   don  t see this unless you think richard grieco looks tough on a motorbike with sunglasses .  br    br   i will soon uptade the cast  list because i have it at home . i wrote it down after i seen the movie .  ,0
i don  t often go out of my way to write comments  but for this i had to  just to warn anyone that might think that by watching this they will see a comedy . this doesn  t come close . while the premise  change in colour  gender  whatever  is bad enough  and has been done  better  many times before  the actual transformation of two black guys into two white girls is one of the least convincing transformations ever put on screen . it would be bad enough if all that was required by the script was a change to white chicks . however the wayans brothers are required to disguise themselves as two specific white women . as you will have guessed by now  they fail completely . i have seen drag queens without makeup make more convincing women than these two do with the best special effects and make  up people that hollywood can provide . its appalling . add to the mix a basketball player built like a building  terrible dialogue and more plot holes than a golf course and this film hits a new personal low . and i like bad movies  avoid like the plague .  ,0
i absolutely adore the book written by robin klein  so i was very excited when i heard that a movie based on the book was in the making .  br    br   but i was severely disappointed with the movie when i did see it because it didn  t capture what i loved about the book  the absolutely ridiculously funny erica and the interesting way in which she views the world .  br    br   from the start of the movie  i realised that things weren  t the same as i had imagined in the book . so  i just went along for the ride . it wasn  t all that bad  i guess . miss belmont was totally different to what i had imagined her to be  i didn  t think she would be one to smoke and drink  jean kittson  who plays her  is hilarious   br    br   on it  s own  i thought the movie and it  s actors  actresses in it did a good job  but alas  i  m such a fan of the book  one of my all time favourite books  that i couldn  t help but feel disappointed p  ,0
spoiler    this movie is based on the concept of what if  of course mr destiny will be able to answer this question . the main character goes through a bad day  like many of us  and asks this question . chaos theory states a butterfly in china could have an effect on someone over here from a chain reaction . the focus of this movie is based on one event during a baseball game . this event sets into motion one  s destiny just like ashton in  the butterfly effect  except mr . destiny uses comedy over drama . the results make a fresh  somewhat original movie . if one  s philosophical are in tune with  the butterfly effect  one will likely enjoy mr . destiny . i give it a  out of   . amazing for i have seen the first half of this movie  times  and finally watched the ending on tbs .  ,1
this film breeches the fine line between satire and silliness . while a bridge system that has no rules may promote marital harmony  it certainly can  t promote winning bridge  so the satire didn  t work for me . but there were some items i found enjoyable anyway  especially with the big bridge match between paul lukas and ferdinand gottschalk near the end of the film . it is treated like very much like a championship boxing match . not only is the arena for the contest roped off in a square area like a boxing ring  there is a referee hovering between the contestants  and radio broadcaster roscoe karns delivers nonstop chatter on the happenings . at one point he even enumerates  one . . . two . . . three . . . four . . .  as though a bid of four diamonds was a knockdown event . and people were glued to their radios for it all  a common event for championship boxing matches . that spoof worked very well indeed .  br    br   unfortunately  few of the actors provide the comedy needed to sustain the intended satire . paul lukas doesn  t have much of a flair for comedy and is miscast lovely loretta young and the usual comic frank mchugh weren  t given good enough lines glenda farrell has a nice comic turn as a forgetful blonde at the start of the film  but she practically disappears thereafter . what a waste of talent   ,0
this film was so predictable  that during the entire time you  re hoping that the obvious suspect is innocent  and there  s some other big twist still coming . however . . . it doesn  t . he just continues to act creepy  and she continues to ignore it . mary found very incriminating evidence at his place  and she still trusted him  and what was that  baiting the trap   there was no trap . she confronted him  he said  excuse me . i have to go kill someone  he left  and that was the end of it . they make attempts to use other suspects   like that one older carnival girl at the end  but they  re completely underdeveloped . actually  all the characters are underdeveloped . they have no depth  and the setting is just plain strange . . . who hangs out in a recycling factory   its choppy and nothing is well developed . for example when she leaves his place after having the beer  and he finds the pics and she runs out and he catches her and they end up having sex in that car . . . what was that  her reactions weren  t portrayed . in the car she acted scared like it could have been practically rape  but then all we see is her showering the next morning . booooooooo it could have been so much better . . sooo much better .  ,0
  sasquatch hunters  actually wasn  t as bad as i thought .  br    br   spoilers  br    br   traveling into the woods  park rangers charles landon   kevin o  connor  roger gordon   matt latimore  brian stratton  david zelina  spencer combs   rick holland  and his sister janet   stacey branscombe  escort dr . helen gilbert   amy shelton  white  her boss dr . ethan edwards   gary sturm  and assistant louise keaton   juliana dever  to find the site of some reputed bones found in the area . when they make camp  the team discovers a giant burial ground and more strange bones littering the area . when members of the group start to disappear  they start to wander through the woods to safety . it  s discovered that a sasquatch is behind the killings  and the team band together to survive .  br    br   the good news this wasn  t as bad as i thought it would be . the movie really starts to pick up some steam at around the half  way point  when the creature attacks . that is a masterful series of scenes  as the whole group is subjected to attacks by the creature  and the suspense throughout the entire play  out is extremely high . the wooded area is most appropriately milked during these parts  heightening the tension and wondering when a single person wandering around in the forest will get their comeuppance . also spread quite liberally through the movie is the effective use of off  screen growls and roars that are truly unworldly . they really do add much to make this part so creepy  as well as the other times the growling shriek is heard . it  s quite effective  and works well . it  s quite nice that the later part of the film picks up the pace  as it goes out pretty well on a high note of action . one scene especially i feel must point out as being a special scene on first viewing . as a man is running through the forest from the creature  he spots the expedition that has gone on looking for it . raising his hands to holler to them for help  the second he goes to announce his presence is he attacked from out of nowhere and killed quite hastily . it caught me by surprise and actually gave me a little jump on first viewing .  br    br   the bad news there was only a couple things to complain about here  and one is a usual complaint . the creature here is mostly rendered by horrible cgi  which made him look totally ridiculous and destroys any credibility it might  ve had . the air of menace conjured up by the opening of the film is almost shot out the window when the creature appears on screen . it  s so distracting that it  s a shame a little more work wasn  t put into it . i  ve complained about this one a lot  and is something that really should be done away with  as it doesn  t look that realistic and is quite fake . another big one is the off  screen kills in here . very often in the film is a person grabbed and then yanked away  and then finding the bloody body afterward . it  s quite aggravating when the kills look nice and juicy afterward . otherwise  i don  t really have much of a problem with this one  as everything else that  s usually critiqued about this one didn  t really bother me  but it is called on for others beyond this stuff .  br    br   the final verdict i kinda liked this one  but it  s still not the best sasquatch movie ever . it  s not supposed to be taken seriously  and if viewed that way  it  s actually quoit enjoyable . fans of these films should give this one a look  and those that like the sci  fi creature features might find some nice things in here as well .  br    br   rated r graphic language  violence and some graphic carcasses  ,1
rudyard kipling once wrote that god gave to all people the ability to love the whole world  but given that a human heart is very small in size  every human has that special place that he loves more than any other . it seems to me that this may have been the motto of some of the most eminent directors of today when they set out to profess the eternal love for that special place and depict situations in the lives of its denizens and visitors . the result is a wonderful collection of short films  paris je t  aime  in which our guides  van sant  coixet  cuaron  payne and others take us on a breathtaking stroll through parisian arrondissements  human feelings  yearnings and expectations .  br    br   always some other quarter  always some utterly moving story about ordinary people in search for love  be it in a parking lot  art studio  tube station . and paris je t  aime is about vast array of loves  love for one  s partner  child  parent  for those who meant the world to us but are no longer around  love that needs rekindling  serendipitous love for that stranger as your eyes meet  or love that just is not meant to be . . . today  but tomorrow  who knows   br    br   nevertheless  this film is not solely about love  but life itself  joy  pain  loneliness  confusion  everyday ups and downs . and its most important quality is the fact that it is not soppy at all  but rather warm and full of hope .  br    br   i give this film a  because the final section of it suggests how some of the stories might further develop  but not all of them and that is the thing that i find missing  and by  further development  i do not mean some specific reference to the characters  future . as far as everything else is concerned i can only say  captivating . makes you want to leave everything behind you  flee to paris and live those little romances yourself .  ,1
soiler it  s fake  the whole thing is a fake  there is no ghosts or zombies  alan is a lord and his cousin or brother or half brother or something like that wants the castle and his title for himself . so he invests this overly complicated and needless pointless plan ala scooby  doo to drive alan to commit suicide . most of the movie is him picking up redheads and attacking them . he  s not even killing them . he drops off to sleep and the girl vanishes and he thinks he buried them someplace . if he looked at the so  called ghost of evelyn  he could tell she was wearing gloves  my god what a waste of time . don  t bother watching it  renting and if you bought it and haven  t watched it yet  sell it . quickly  do yourself a favor and stay away from the night evelyn came out of the grave . i give this stinker the crap  o  lantern .  ,0
first time of seeing buster keaton  s first feature film and i have to admit i liked it a lot and only wish i  d stumbled across it years ago . the rohauer blurb at the start warns that the three ages single nitrate print was rediscovered and salvaged in     just in time before combustion  and many frames that seemed hopelessly glued together were separated . so  it  s rocky viewing in places  but i  ve seen and survived much worse .  br    br   it would have been ok as the  short films but as a take on intolerance it  s inventive and funny from the start to the finish in the stone age with baddie wallace beery riding an elephant and goodie buster riding a pet brontosaurus in the roman age buster riding a chariot with wheel locks and adapted for sledging  no parking signs in latin in this technological age of speed need and greed his car beautifully falls to bits at the first hump . both him and beery are after the girl through the ages  a never ending tussle . favourite bit as the caveman he gets knocked backward over a cliff edge but still blows a kiss to the camera  an amazing second or two   br    br   great stuff  reaffirming my love of silent film comedy .  ,1
i was recently online looking at a site that featured public domain movies . in their long list of films was this film and i thought i must be hallucinating at such an offensive title and premise . but  no  that  s really what it was . and since the film was only about   minutes long  i decided to give it a try . if it had turned out to be some porno movie  i would have stopped watching . instead  it turned out to be the most bizarre film i have ever seen . the danish production crew tried  with a budget of about     to make a star trek  style film about a crew of very gay men traveling about the galaxy wiping out female oppression by killing all the women   like they proceeded to do on the earth  and in every case  they were met with cheers and thanks from the now gay men of the planet .  br    br   subtle  this ain  t . with some of the most obscene and juvenile names of characters i  ve ever heard  i don  t even think i can write them on imdb without having my review removed  however  despite the utter crappiness of it all  it was strangely watchable and worth a peek . but  as i mentioned already  due to the crude names and odd subject matter  though no nudity   it  s a film for adults only .  br    br   by the way  this movie left me with     questions as to who would make this  why make it and who was the intended audience   it may not be the absolute worst thing i have ever seen  but it probably is the weirdest and possibly the most offensive   ,0
ok so i hear about this new justin timberlake movie coming out which features some pretty big names . i mean great actors like  the freeman aka morgan freeman  an asset to hollywood  however completely wasted in this film . then we got kevin spacey  who i  ve been a great fan of ever since i watched american beauty and the usual suspects . both of these great actors probably signed on to the movie thinking it was going to be a great movie as i did when i heard the story . then enter a fresh faced justin timberlake . i say fresh faced because this is his first movie and those rotten tomatoes haven  t hit him yet . well the reason for that  i might add  is because no one will ever see this movie or even bother reading this review . the movie is so terrible that when i got into the first   minutes of it . the characters were so one dimensional that it makes some bible characters look like the don corleone . they got the one liners and sound  bite worthy stuff . the token troubled black guy  ll cool j  who is with a gorgeous woman who he otherwise would not even belong with in real life . the captain is this short whiny guy who speaks in such a high tone . and what crappy movie would be complete without the hero becoming richer because of an experience . oh and lots of gun fire  i mean a whole lot . spoiler  not     the kind of gun fire that leaves everyone in the police force who  s crooked dead and the hero prevails . they got flame throwers and rocket launchers  really no kidding .  br    br   bottom line if you want to see edison its because you are a great fan of one of the actors  or a great fan of justin timberlake  to all the   year old girls out there  enjoy   i wish i had more hands  because then i would have more thumbs  because this movie is so terrible because then i could give it so many thumbs down that thumbs down would no longer mean anything because this movie is so terrible because it sucks so badly that it made me laugh out of frustration about the story line because it just would not end because the firing and yelling just kept happening .  br    br   may gd have mercy on us all and save us from these terrible movies . well it could be worst  another rnb terrible actor turned singer turned terrible actor is usher  hehe check out in the mix lol  or even get rich or die trying  . now the special thing about that movie is that its got    year old men  playing   or even younger teens . i could go on with these .  ,0
i  m sorry  but this may have been scary in     when it came out  but in modern times it just doesn  t hold up . the only interesting scene in the entire movie is the opening scene where michael kills his sister  judith  wearing his halloween mask . the most startling moment in the whole film is when his parents rip the mask off to see their son killed their daughter . the film goes downhill from there and doesn  t pick up until the last fifteen minutes  but by then it  s too late  we the audience have lost all interest in the story . there is barely any character development  and people always rave about laurie being such an exceptional heroine  when there really isn  t much to her . i  m sorry to disagree with everyone terrified by this movie  but if you want a great horror movie go watch the shining or rosemary  s baby . those are the two best horror films ever made . halloween is certainly not in their ranks . i can  t believe roger ebert gave it four stars  for there is no way this film could ever deserve such a high rating .  ,0

i just finished watching this on tv and what can i say but this is the worst film i have ever seen  i  m embarrassed to be from melbourne  where the film was made . diabolical acting  amateurish makeup effects and a really bad soundtrack . as for the plot  well  thats even more stupid  some of the scenes just left me stunned as to how bad it was . there  s a reason they put these types of films on late night tv  because they  re utter rubbish  avoid at all costs .  ,0
what can i say . a kamal hassan movie being horrible . he acts very well  but it is a horrible story  along with horrible direction . in my kind opinion  the director gautham menon must give up directing . there is a lot of tragedy throughout the movie . apart from that  one can just not believe how true were those horrendous crimes . there was no practicality in the movie . gautham is just running out of stories . but both kamal hassan and jyothika act really well . the villains look too ugly  though their performance was not bad . i do not think this is a sunday afternoon movie like padayappa which you can see with the family . you will not get sleep seeing this movie   however  harris jayaraj again did a great job  and that is why i have given this movie  out of   . his song  partha modail nallae  is soulful and soothing . apart from that  great cinematography . on the whole  this is just a bad  bad movie . kamal hassan  i think  should have rejected this movie .  ,0
wow . a truly fantastic  trip  movie that has tons of super  surreal imagery  dark intent and a black  pretty strange sense of how cartoon animals must see the world . it  s populated with a very cute off  world bunch of characters that bend and flow with warped backgrounds . as with all cool fantasy  the wandering plot is secondary to the eye  popping visuals and we follow a little cat and his zombie sister as they encounter death  deluge  water elephants  samurai swordsmen and pigs that fish . i  d never heard of it  but now i love it  probably because it reminded me of the surreal pencil  work of american cartoonist bill plympton . it  s a demented delight for fans of odd  pretty things and it had me glued to the screen for fear i  d miss something amazing . simply put  it  s  hello kitty  without the  o  .  ,1
purple rain . . . what else can i say  the title speaks for itself . but i think all the actors were well picked . the movie had a great story . i loved it  ever since i watched that movie  i  ve been stuck in the eighties  and i  m only    my favorite part of the movie was when his father died and he was picking up all of his music compositions  and the apollonia was sitting on the stairwell with his earing in her hand . critics say that its a drama but i think its more of a romance . murphy brown also did a great job in the movie  he actually acted like himself . i  m so glad i  ve seen this movie . the song purple rain  beautifully sung  was so heartfelt . i cried more than once .  ,1
i saw this on dvd  its known as corrupt in this format  and the blurb on the casing really hyped up how harvey keitels character frank is so much like the one he played bad lieutenant in  this gritty and powerful police thriller  . what the casing didnt mention was that this is an old italian movie . how old is it theo  well when a character plays music he doesnt put on the cd player  he pulls out a big plastic pancake thing  puts it on a sort of revolving hob where a sort of mechanical arm touches the pancake thingy causing music to be heard . you see my point about this being an old film  the dvd case gave no clue this was a movie made   years ago . its also a film with poor production values like so many other italian films masquerading as american ones . with the exception of keitel the cast are awful though johnny rottens performance is bizarre rather than terrible  the cinematography is static with the picture and sound quality giving the impression that i was watching a fourth generation pirate copy  i dont know if its down to a dodgy dvd or if its a very bad film print  and worst of all is ennio morricones score . its impossible to belive the man who did the irritating intrusive incidental music for corrupt is the same one who did the music for those clint eastwood westerns .  br    br   all of this is a pity because corrupt does have its moments . its by no means the greatest psycho thriller ever devised but it did hold my interest and as always keitel puts in a good performance as a violent nutcase cop . just a pity the rest of the movie didnt match up to his high standards  ,0
i love this film . the noir imagery combined with spillane  s no nonsense character mike hammer works marvellously to create a mood and feel seldom found in low budget detective films of the early fifties . it may not be  the maltese falcon  but this film makes it  s own solid contribution to the genre . spillane is often criticised for alleged misogyny etc  but his  dames  are way above their male counterparts in terms of cunning and intelligence . poor old mike hammer  as effectively played by biff elliott  is blinded by the beauty of the mysterious psychiatrist whom he meets when investigating the death of an army buddy . when the penny finally drops his face is a picture . good to see that   s censorship did not force the film makers to omit the famous last line . a bona fide low budget classic .  ,1
  creepshow   is little more than a pale imitation of the original  designed with little purpose other than to cash in on the name of the previous film . it even amplifies the flaws of its predecessor  which was often predictable and heavy  handed . still  the first time around  there were enough thrills to make up for it  s periodic lulls  resulting in an uneven but overall fairly entertaining effort . the sequel has few worthwhile moments  so the transparency of the stories are even more apparent . once in a while  it delivers  but most of the time  it just lingers there .  br    br   as in the original  all the stories revolve around the common theme of revenge and just desserts . a wooden indian comes to life  wreaking vengeance upon the killers of its owner . teenagers are devoured by an aquatic monster . a hitchhiker returns from the dead to pursue a careless motorist . none of these premises are inherently bad in themselves  but they are utterly lacking in inspiration . there are few surprises and no scares . this a textbook example of unmotivated  by  the  numbers filmmaking . it doesn  t help that this cheap  looking movie suffers from a flat directorial style  although to be honest  there wasn  t much to work with . in the end  the second story comes off best  but not by much .  br    br   for the most part  the performances are okay at best . george kennedy  as the ill  fated general store owner  does an adequate  if not particularly inspired job . dorothy lamour  on the other hand  is quite good as the guilt  ridden motorist  evoking sympathy for her plight despite the predictable  redundant material . however  most of the characters are pretty thin overall .  br    br   one would think that  creepshow   would have turned out better . george romero  who directed the original  returned to pen the screenplay  based on more of stephen king  s stories . makeup effects artist tom savini turns in some good  gory work . so why is the film a letdown  i guess romero didn  t really want to make a second film  but was forced to do so for financial reasons . it was a decade of horror sequels  clones  rip  offs  and whatnot  so this one was certainly inevitable . i can imagine the guy writing the script in a hurry  picking up his paycheck  and running off . i guess he had to do what was necessary to get his own projects financed we can  t blame him .  br    br   rating      out of    br    br   released by new world pictures  ,0

it was pointed out in a now deleted post from another imdb user that anyone who might see  the medusa touch  should be warned about a scene that  s eerily reminiscent of the sept .        terrorist attacks in nyc . but i hope anyone reading this will consider this warning . despite an interesting pedigree  producer elliott kastner produced  harper  and  the long goodbye   co  producer arnon milchan co  produced the oscar  nominated  l . a . confidential  and screenwriter john briley won an oscar for  gandhi   and an international cast  i found  the medusa touch  to be a heavy  handed  unintentional laugh riot . it was a poorly directed  horribly written and acted mess . it tried to capitalize on the   s telekinetic thrillers genre . the movie fails on many counts . please consider  carrie  and the underrated  the fury   both directed by brian depalma  . they were two entertaining and exciting thrillers that dealt with the same subject matter .  ,0
this low budget digital video film has strengths in the right places   writing and acting . in addition the digital photography is the best of the lot so far . in low light conditions the characteristic video umber tone prevails but  surprising  it rivals film stock for brightness  clarity  and  saturation in brightly lit situations . this is grass roots film making at its best with snappy dialogue carrying a  midnight cowboy  kind of story about grifters doing whatever it takes to survive in urban san francisco .  ,1
this movie is just crap . even though the directors claim to be part of that oi  culture  it  s still a very  very bad directorial debut . the topic itself is very interesting and i accept the bad acting due to the fact  that they are all amateurs and never acted before  but the worst thing about this film are the dialogs and very unexperienced and naive directing . there  s no timing at all in that movie . i felt like the directors were so exited to do that movie  it  s their first feature   that they actually never really asked themselves  what story they wanna tell . i met ben  one of the directors  on several occasions and he  s a nice and thoughtful guy  but that doesn  t make him a director . i think  that  american history x  is full of clichs  but somehow manages to transport a story .  oi  warning  is full of clichs  doesn  t tell anything new or provocative and   that  s the sad thing about this movie  it  s far from any oi   reality .  br    br   if you wanna see weird but great german films  watch the movies of michael haneke  christoph schlingensief  oskar roehler  hans weingartner or oliver hirschbiegel  br    br   benny  s video funny games die unberhrbare mein letzter film das experiment das weisse rauschen muxmuschenstill . . .  br    br    out of ten  because of the topic and the photography  ,0
  the secretary  is one of those cheesy  cliched   thrillers  that one is subjected to watching on a sunday afternoon  when there is virtually nothing else on . while the plot  a demented woman becomes jealous of all who succeed over her in the office and decides to do whatever she can to stop them  may be one of a kind  i recognized countless plot twists  probably taken from other tv movies that i had been subjected to for the very same reason .  br    br   to make matters worse  i was not wild about the cast . mel harris is one of those actresses who appears in so many tv movies as either a  mom  or some sort of  victim  of foul play or abuse  that one must wonder the kind of life she leads . in this one  she gets the joy of playing a mom and a victim of psycho secretary sheila kelly  who was not a very good choice as the villain . while sheila kelly has made some good career moves  singles  breaking in  and i guess  law and order   she is also beset by a string of pitiful tv movie roles  and this one just adds to it . as for the others  i don  t have any clear memories of them  so that must say something .  br    br   this one will play on the lifetime network  i think that  s where i saw it   but don  t bother watching it  unless you are too bored for words . not that it will make you any more excitied . . .  ,0
with such actors as ralph richardson  raymond massey  cedrick hardwicke  and margaretta scott  how can you go wrong . very unusual scenics  especially the modern ones . the realization of the modern machinery is very effective . here you have ray  gun blasts from building vehicles that help clear the area  so new structures can be made . although she  s much younger in this film  it  s not very hard to figure out who the future mrs . pumphrey from the bbc series  all creatures great and small is going to be  really effective  reappearance  of both raymond massey and ralph richardson . the musical score is by the renowned swiss composer  artur honegger and it is also unusual . for the time       it looks like they used really  large sets or the effects make it seem that way . lastly  it  s a really good story .  ,1

blank check is a movie that i saw on tv one day and like most movies they air on tv blank check wasn  t that good . first of all no one i have ever met has seen blank check and that includes people that grew up in the   s . also blank check won  t be remembered in the   s either simply due to the fact that it will be overshadowed by pixar  s films . i wouldn  t call blank check a bad film but its not really entertaining either .  or at least it isn  t to anyone over the age of   blank check isn  t a entertaining film because nothing about it is original . everything just makes you go  what haven  t i seen this before   blank check rips off and tries to cash in on everything from richie rich to home alone  which strangely enough both have macaulay culkin in it  blank check isn  t a bad movie  but it deserves to fade into obscurity .  ,0
i  ve just seen it . . . . for those who don  t know what it is  i suggest to download the entire feature and enjoy viewing it . . . it  s kinda amateur made trailer featuring the same producer of the famous short batman dead end  but this time besides the black knight there is also superman . . . it would be wonderful if they made the entire movie . . . but i  m afraid that it  s almost impossible  especially just before the official batman  film .  br    br     there is no greater crime against peace than the refusal to fight for it .  br    br   lorenzo  purifier  pinto  ,1
this is quite an unusual and unique little western  that is made mostly original due to its story that revolves around an unique and superior winchester     rifle and all of those who get to poses it at one point or another in the movie .  br    br   it  s mostly a very entertaining movie to watch but not without still being a real western as well . the movie got done in a typical     s      s style of western genre film  making  so the lovers of the genre should not be turned off by its somewhat unusual main premise .  br    br   because the rifle is actually being the main plot device of the movie  it allows the story to follow multiple characters throughout the movie  who are all connected of course and the story makes full circle in the end . without that this movie would had been a pretty messy one to watch  since the story often jumps from the one hazardous occasion into the other  with constantly different characters involved . quite amazing how they even managed to put wyatt earp in this all . but it  s no criticism really . i liked that the movie and its story were being original and how the movie seemed to move from the one event to the other . it gave the movie a bit of a sense of adventure and entertainment .  br    br   it  s also a really great looking movie . i liked the settings the movie used and it seems quite amazing that this was actually the director anthony mann  s first western . luckily he would go on to direct more westerns later on  which also often would star james stewart in the main lead .  br    br   it was a pretty daring casting choice to pick james stewart as the main lead . he is one of the softest and most polite looking and acting actors  so casting him as a tough gunslinger seems like a bit of an odd pick . but stewart is surprisingly convincing as a tough guy and it shows how versatile and really capable as an actor he actually was .  br    br   it also has some other surprising actors in the movie  that are not often get connected with this genre . shelley winters plays the female lead and also later well known actors rock hudson and tony curtis appear in some small roles .  br    br   a real western with also plenty of action and entertainment to it .  br    br        ,1
a pot  boiler if ever i saw one . a supposed thriller borrowing from  a time to kill    silence of the lambs   even an inverted  in the heat of the night  with a little reverse murder  a la  strangers on a train  thrown in  it fails abysmally where all the above  to a large degree  succeeded . namely  in delivering thrills . the plot seems condensed from a bigger book  making the plot developments obvious and uninvolving  while the direction lacks pace and verve . to rein in any kudos  a major twist had to be delivered along the way and here it fails palpably too . connery is clearly slowing down in his old age  barely bothering with his attempt at a us accent and besides seems too old to be the husband of hope lange and the father of those gosh  darn kids of his . he even has a father in law who seems younger than him . laurence fishburne barely gets the chance to inhabit his role and you  re confused from the outset as to whether he  s a bad guy or a good guy . someone once said that flashbacks shouldn  t lie  they do  confusedly  here . the rest of the playing is merely average by a reasonable cast in their underwritten stereotyped roles . the supposed climax managed too  to roll by leaving me firmly entrenched in the back  not as should have been the aim  front edge of my seat . mediocre sloppy hollywood film making for sure .  ,0
coonskin might be my favorite ralph bakshi film . like the best of his work  it  s in  your  face and not ashamed of it for a second  but unlike some of his other work  even when he  s at his finest  which was before and after coonskin with heavy traffic and wizards   it  s not much uneven  despite appearances to the contrary . bakshi  s taking on stereotypes and perceptions of race  of course  but moreover he  s making what appears to be a freewheeling exploitation film blaxploitation almost  though bakshi doesn  t stop just there . if it were just a blaxploitation flick with inventive animation it could be enough for a substantial feature . but bakshi  s aims are higher throwing up these grotesque and exaggerated images of not just black people but italians  mafioso  homosexuals  jews  overall new york  types in the urban quarters of manhattan in the   s  he isn  t out to make anything realistic . the most normal looking creation in looking drawn  real  is  in fact  a naked woman painted red  white and blue .  br    br   in mocking these stereotypes and conventions and horrible forms of racism  i . e . the  tar  rabbit  baby  joke  yes joke  plus black  face   we  re looking at abstraction to a grand degree . and best of all  bakshi doesn  t take himself too seriously  unlike spike lee with a film like bamboozled  in delivering his message . this is why  for the most part  coonskin is a hilarious piece of work  where some of the images and things done and sudden twists and  of course  scenes of awkward behavior  i loved the scene where the three animated characters are being talked at by the real  life white couple in tux and dress as looking  colorful  and the like   are just too much not to laugh at . it  s not just the imagery  which is in and of itself incredibly  over   stylized  but that the screenplay is sharp and  this is key for bakshi this time considering  it  s got a fairly cohesive narrative to string along the improvisations and madness .  br    br   using at first live  action  then animation  and then an extremely clever matching of the two  ironically  what bakshi later went for in commercial form with cool world is done here to a t with less money and a rougher edge   pappy and randy are waiting outside a prison wall for a buddy to escape  and pappy tells of the story of brother rabbit  who with brother bear and preacher fox go to harlem and become big  time hoodlums  with rabbit in direct opposition to a jabba  the  hut  esquire godfather character . this is obviously a take off on song of the south with its intentionally happy  go  lucky plot and animation  here taken apart and shown for how rotten and offensive it really is .  br    br   yet bakshi goes for broke in combining forms animated characters stand behind and move along with live  action backgrounds when violence and gunshots and fights occurs it  s as bloody as it can get for      when a dirty cop is at a bar and is drugged and put in black  face and a dress  he trips in a manner of which not even disney could reach with dumbo a boxing match with brother bear and an opponent as the climax is filmed in wild slow  motion archive footage comes on from time to time of old movies  some and some from the   s that are just tasteless .  br    br   like mel brooks or kubrick or  more recently  south park  bakshi  s coonskin functions as entertainment first and then thought  provocation second . it  s also audacious film  making on an independent scale everything from the long takes to the montage and the endlessly warped designs for the characters  however all based on the theme of the piece  all serve the thought in the script  where its b  movie plot opens up much more for interpretation . to call it racist misses the point it  s like calling dr . strangelove pro  atomic desolation or confederate states of america pro slavery . and  for me  it  s one of the best satires ever made .  ,1
don  t say i didn  t warn you  but your gonna laugh . probably enough to hurt your stomach . sure it  s got some blood splattering  all in good fun though . so  it  s got no budget  who needs a budget when you got a script like this .  br    br   take the time and check this out . well worth a two hour viewing . if everyone could laugh as much as i did during this movie the world would be a much happier place to live .  br    br    ,1
after several extremely well ratings to the point of superb  i was extremely pleased with the film . the film was dark  moving  the anger  the pain  the guilt and a very extremely convincing demon .  br    br   i had initially expected to see many special effects  and like a lover  s caress  it blew me away with the subtlety and the rightness of it . brian  i am again blown away with your artistry with the telling of the story and your care of the special effects . you will go a long way  my friend . i will definitely be the president of your fan club .  br    br   eric etebari  the best actor award  was the number one choice . you made jr . lopez look like a child compared to kasadya .    br    br   overall  the acting  story line  the high quality filming and awesome effects  it was fantastic . i just wish it were longer . i am looking forward to the dreamless with extremely high expectations .  ,1
this film is a pure failure . i am a steve martin fan  but even he can  t save the tired idea and swiss cheese script . think  police academy   and apply it to a military parody . yuck .  br    br   i do not feel the other user comments reflected the poor rating this film received  and rightfully deserved   . it is extremely misleading . i have often seen this film marked down to   .   in the grocery store and now i certainly know why .  br    br   if only i could get my   minutes back . . .  ,0
never viewed this film until recently on tcm and found this story concerning poland and a small town which had to suffer with the nazi occupation of the local towns just like many other european cities for example norway . the first world war was over and people in this town were still suffering from their lost soldiers and the wounded which war always creates . alexander knox   wilhelm gimm   gorky park  returns from the war with a lost leg and was the former school teacher in town . he was brought up a german and was not very happy with the polish people and they in turn did not fully accept him either . as the hitler party grew to power wilhelm grimm desired to become a nazi in order to return and punish this small polish town for their treatment towards him which was really all in his mind . marsha hunt   marja pacierkowski    chloe  s prayer   played an outstanding role as a woman who lost her husband and was romantically involved with whilhelm gimm . there are many flashbacks and some very real truths about how the nazi destroyed people  s families and their entire lives . the cattle cars are shown in this picture with jewish people heading to the nazi gas chambers . if you have not seen this film  and like this subject matter  give it some of your time this film is very down to earth for a     film and a story you will not forget too quickly .  ,1
a sexually obsessed chef leads a duplicitous life one as a  happily  married man with a ten year oldish child  the other as a sex fiend . the bulk of the documentary  like film follows him for five consecutive days and is told in flashback with nastassja kinski as a clinical sex therapist  listening to his story and intelligently probing him . nastassja  s role is very restrictive and she is the only principal adult character who does not take off her clothes . if she had  i would have rated this movie a big fat  f .  as it is  it rates an f  implying that it is still a failure unless one likes to be bored . it is probably a lot more interesting to spend ninety minutes cleaning out the garage .  diary of a sex addict  falls into the category of films that once one has seen it  one wishes that one hadn  t .  ,0
as for many on here i can  t help but praise the cast and crew who developed talespin and others they made throughout my childhood  i as all who have commented here have thoroughly enjoyed the quality of not just the animation but the quality of the story lines and the characters .  br    br   to class this work of art as a  cartoon  could never do talespin justice  in fact it  s an insult to class it as a  cartoon   talespin is an animation and nothing less  it is evidently the greatest work of genius to be produced at disney to date  when disney  pulled  it from the air little did they realise what they did and i  m sure their souls have been tortured by regret ever since .  br    br   i  ll take a moment to explain  from the first which is ducktales to the last which i think is darkwing duck  disney has been plagued with failures due to political correctness and have taken a quantum leap backwards since  they prefer quantity over quality now not to mention the room full of monkey  s for the story  s  i couldn  t have my children watching the mind  numbing  cartoons  they throw out now in fear that they would all turn out to be homer simpson some time in the future and    of the blame would be on me for permitting them to watch it  i couldn  t let that happen  which is why i have all of the shows from the late    s to the mid    s on a harddrive so one day my children couldn  t be corrupted by the  cartoon crap  of today and to savour the last piece of childhood i have and to hold on to and i owe that all to talespin .  br    br   talespin to me is without a doubt the best animation ever produced in the world on account of it  s depth  charm  wit  compassion  emotion and lack of truly bad quality and story lines of which many have today  do you see any of that content in say  ed  edd and eddie or anything else you can think of   the rubbish produced today can be likened to some  year old  s undecipherable hyroglyph depicting a picasso .  br    br   the next time you watch an episode of talespin take a look at the woodgrain on any wooden object or building such as higher for hire and salivate over the quality of workmanship and effort put into this animation  even the one shot backgrounds were done as though they would use them again and again  the buildings look true to the art deco movement which was popular in the time period depicted  even the vehicles are true to life  ok not all of the episodes were fantastic in animation but the lower grade scenes were covered up by the superior scenes so all in all it evened it all out by the end of the episode and you  d probably never even notice at all unless you were focused and have an attention to detail .  br    br   the one thing i love about this is what i like to call the  deliberate mistakes  or  intended mistakes  in each episode and some have two  for example in sheepskin deep where rebecca say  s  you  re up to something baloo  and baloo replies  who  me   i  m as innocent as a schoolboy  take a look into rebecca  s eyes  i won  t spoil the rest of the baloopers but just keep an eye out next time .  br    br   everyone elses comment  s are bang on and     correct  i have nothing else to add that others haven  t said already on here  disney  wake up and smell the coffee  you have been asleep for over a decade  stop producing rubbish and bring back quality into animations and stop producing  cartoons   we have seen the proof of what you can do and we want it back as rapidly as possible .  ,1
i unknowingly had this movie on my shelf for a while in a mill creek collection  and one night i just decided to watch it though not expecting much . as the beginning credits roll around i  m surprised to discover this film was made under the filmirage company . filmirage brought the world such amazing stinkers as  troll     ator the invincible   and  quest for the mighty sword   so i was compelled to watch .  br    br   as the movie started out it had potential to be pretty decent  even though it was unoriginal . the gore scenes could have been improved if they were extended and more frequent . but after a while into the film  the pace started dragging and i found myself thinking  okay someone better get killed soon   or  someone better mutate  . at the onset of this drag  when i was having these thoughts  though someone may have gotten killed or have mutated  however as noted  the gore and effects weren  t very good . what made matters worse was that the scene transitions were confusing example first dr . houseman would be at the zoo  then he  d have a flash back about possibly killing someone  finally he  d wake up in a cold sweat in bed   making the audience ask  was he dreaming he was at the zoo   . like the movie  s pace  these scene transitions got progressively worse .  br    br   i could try to say the character development of dr . houseman was pretty good  but towards the end of the film  that is  once you  ve seen what the doctor has metamorphosed into  hopefully you  ll laugh   which really  is the only reason to see this movie at least once this movie unintentionally runs like a long  winded joke .  br    br   the costume of the um  thing that doctor houseman becomes can also be seen in joe d  amato  s  quest for the mighty sword   which was made in the same year . you  ve gotta love filmirage movies  they  re always re  using the same stuff   ,0
i  ll get to the movie in a minute . first  someone wanted  proof  about clinton  s comments at georgetown  where he claimed that the usa  deserved  the     attacks . well  here  s what clinton said  br    br    in the first crusade  when the christian soldiers took jerusalem  they first burned a synagogue with    jews in it and proceeded to kill every woman and child who was a muslim on the temple mount . i can tell you that story is still being told today in the middle east and we are still paying for it .   br    br   we  re still paying for it  whaddya mean  we   paleface  the marines didn  t storm the temple mount .  br    br   but in truth  clinton never really came out and flatly said that we  deserved      . like all his statements during his presidency  he implied that we deserved     . just point out  fact  a  b  c  and maybe d  and let the listener deduce that they must add up to conclusion x . when in truth  most of clinton  s  facts  added up to guacamole .  br    br   but that  s beside the point . we  re here to talk movies  not politics . unfortunately  when oliver  captain conspiracy  stone does a movie  you can  t escape his warped politics . it was only a matter of time before he focused his paranoia and bitterness on the reagan era  and what better time than when stone  s dreams almost came true  on the day reagan nearly bought the farm . unable to find any nefarious plots or schemes in hinckley  s assassination attempt  he invents one with al haig . from a simple misunderstanding of the chain of constitutional authority  haig is transformed from a public servant who really should have brushed up on his remedial civics into a raving megalomaniac . you almost expect haig to rub his hands together like montgomery burns and tell cap weinberger to  release the hounds .  stone even recruits the smarmiest person in hollywood to play our former secretary of state  richard dreyfuss . a guy you love to hate on sight .  br    br   overall  the movie is ok . average  hovering on below average . don  t bother renting or buying . try to catch it on cable .  out of   .  ,0
okay  my title is kinda lame  and almost sells this flick short . i remember watching siskel  ebert in    talking about this movie  and then playing a clip or two . not being a rap  conscious guy  although i could identify snoop dogg  vanilla ice  and mc hammer music   i wasn  t much interested when they started talking about the film . but then  se showed the scene where the band explains how they picked their name  using some  shady  logic and a bunch of  made up  facts   and then another scene where the band  and their rival band  both visit a school to promote getting involved  and  of course  nwh comes up with some  info  about how the rival band leader is a loser because he got good grades in school and was on the yearbook committee  . so i filed it away that i should see this movie .  br    br   a couple of years later  this thing shows up on hbo and i recorded it  only to laugh my butt off for hours . yes  it has a  spinal tap  kind of rhythm to it . . . even the documentarist takes essentially the same  tone  in setting up the clips  and the band follows a similar path  what i now call the  behind the music  phenomenon  smalltime band has good chemistry  gets famous  too much money too fast  squabbling  drugs  some type of death  band breaks up  then reconciles  finishing with a hope for more albums in the future  and fade to black  . the one thing that is true is that in spinal tap  you catch the band perhaps with a little more success in their past . but tap drags at some points  and in my mind is reduced to laughs that are set up by specific scenes . oh  this is his rant about the backstage food  this is spot where he wants the amp to go to  eleven   this is the spot where the guy makes the pint  sized stonehenge  etc . . .  br    br   contrasting to foabh  which seems to have more  unexpected  humor . you can see some of it coming  but there isn  t a big setup for every joke . sometimes  the jokes just kinda flow . cundieff and the other actors in the band had a real chemistry that worked . also  the direct references to vanilla ice  hammer  and a bunch of other caricature  type rappers really worked well . this strikes me as a film you watch once to get the main story and laughs  and then go back and watch to catch the subtle jokes . and the songs . is  my peanuts  better than  big bottom   from spinal tap   i don  t know  but they  re both damn funny . tone def  s awful video during his  awakening  phase is so bizarre  yet so funny .  br    br   i could go on awhile  but save your time and don  t waste it on cb  . i watched the first half hour  and got bored . you don  t get bored on foabh . there are slightly less funny moments  but you can never tell when something good is about to happen . perhaps my favorite scene is when ice cold and tastey taste  name ripoffs if i  ve ever heard any  discover they  ve been sharing the same girl . . . . at one point  you  ve got those two pointing guns at each other  and the next thing you know  the manager  the photographer  the girl  and i think even tone def are in the room pointing guns at each other  switching targets back and forth . and  of course  someone does get shot .  br    br   i did find it odd that nwh  s managers suffered similar fates to spinal tap  s drummers  although none spontaneously combusted  i don  t think  . there were enough similarities that i cannot ignore the likelihood that cundieff saw  spinal tap  prior to writing this film  although this is clearly much more the spinal tap of hip  hop . while some similarities exist  the humor is different  and the movie seems more like a real documentary  maybe because we don  t recognize a single actor in this thing  even the guy who played  lamar  from  revenge of the nerds   . all in all  this movie has  in my opinion   street cred  . kinda like nwh .  ,1
the real star of this ridiculous story is glorious technicolor . a visual treat to the eye  the film fails to stimulate the mind and heart . i was intrigued  at first  by the idea of dietrich and boyer leaving religion in order to  find  their capacity for love . what follows is a huge disappointment . boyer is the only real actor in the production and one feels his torment . dietrich  s amazing wardrobe outshines her performance   at times her face is frightening to look at   a unfeeling mask . as a monk  boyer held the formula for the monastery  s liquer  which reminds me of the true story of chartreuse    when he leaves his  marriage to god  the reaction by his fellow monks holds the shock and fear that perpetuate organized religion . the viewer feels boyer was well rid of his past . however  the journey that follows is all too predictable .  ,0
i just watched the convent for the second time . i had enjoyed it previously and figured it would make for a good drunken friday night film  some gore  some style  bit of humour and suchlike . i was saddened to find that i could no longer appreciate it much . it seemed like someone had set out to revisit cheeseball epics like night of the demons for a modern audience but lost the things that made the original worthwhile . for the record i  m not even a huge fan of night of the demons  but there were some things i really dug about it . the convent does the cheese but the not the goodness so much . apart from the main girl  likeable performance from joanna canton   the goth girl and a sweet cameo from adrienne barbeau pretty much all the characters were excruciatingly unlikeable  festering at the absolute lowest levels of moronic  offensive jockhood . the film is then gravely hampered by the complete lack of gratuitous nudity which means that  given the awful dialogue  it is difficult to watch the characters and harder to appreciate the good points of the film . the evil nuns are original in design and get lots of good scenes  though not scary their certainly kinda cool  and the film also fields a fair amount of neat gore . towards the end  when adrienne barbeau is on the scene the film becomes quite entertaining cause all the obnoxious people are dead and its an evil nun bashing frenzy . the stylised direction also occasionally yields good results  although sometimes the camera just moves too fast . all in all  this was a film where for me the shining good points just can  t make up for the things i hated . those more fond of this kind of film may well enjoy it a lot more  but for me it wasn  t a good time .  ,0
i have had the chance to watch several movies in bluray and hd dvd . this movie stays to it  s wonderful action and great story . although if you are looking for a movie with an excellent picture this one is not it . not having this movie on dvd helped make the purchase easier . i have always enjoyed the intense action and the excellent acting which don  t always go together . overall that is what makes this an excellent fun film to watch . now on the blu ray scale . in many blu ray movies you either get two things . a picture that is almost crystal clear with no distortion or a movie with grainy hd picture . i was disappointed when i made this my first blu ray movie . i almost began to think that this was a blu ray standard . although after watching other movies i know better . i don  t believe they spent as much time as they should have transferring this movie over to hd . that is generally the problem with some movies . and for the price of blu ray players and the blue ray discs you should only have the best picture . so i only consider this a worthwhile investment for people who have either never seen the movie or have not bought the dvd version .  ,1
this film ends with a speech in which the narrator tells us the fates of two of the lead characters and that the names of people and places have been changed . . . before telling us that relation to actual people and events are purely coincidental . this ending line actually sums up everything that has gone before it as rino di silvestro  s messy film completely lacks vision  and if there is any point to the plot it wasn  t put there on purpose . werewolf woman is often seen as a guilty pleasure or a  so bad it  s good  film  but i completely disagree . normally  i enjoy films like this but werewolf woman is indeed a bad film  and despite all the sex and savagery on display it doesn  t even make for a fun watch  and that really is unforgivable . the film really doesn  t have much plot  but the thin sliver we are given involves a young woman  who also happens to dream that she is a werewolf . she dreams of going out and finding men  having sex with them and eventually killing them . back in the real world  she falls in love  but her lover is killed and she goes out for revenge . . .  br    br   the film is made up of scenes of sex and gore  which are padded out with extremely dull talking sequences in which various characters mull over the recent events . these scenes are probably there to forward the plot and build characters but they really don  t do that  and succeed only in turning what could have been a passable exploitation romp into an extremely underwhelming film . it would seem that the director was more interested in style and atmosphere than the plot  and this is shown by the fact that the film looks and sounds nice . the sex scenes are often overlong and not very erotic  but the gore works well . the premise is ripe for giving way to a very sexy slice of exploitation  as there  s plenty of naked women  and the fact that the central character has a werewolf origin means that there could be plenty of erotica but this isn  t capitalised on  and while i can stomach huge doses of bad acting and poorly done plot lines  i really can  t stand watching films and being bored . overall  i wouldn  t even recommend this film to big exploitation fans . there  s plenty of better stuff than this out there  and while the title may sound intriguing  the film isn  t .  ,0
final score  .   out of     br    br   after seeing  jay and silent bob strike back  i must have been on a big eliza dushku kick when i rented this movie .  soul survivors  is a junk  psychological thriller  dressed up like a trashy teen slasher flick  even to the point of having a masked killer stalk a cast of young up  and  comers like dushku  wes bentley  american beauty   casey affleck  drowning mona  and likable star melissa sagemiller . luke wilson is also in there  ridiculously miscast as a priest . the movie  the brainchild of writer  director stephen carpenter  seems like a mutant offspring of  open your eyes  or  vanilla sky  and movies where a character  and the audience  is caught in a world of dillusion caused by an accident  death . the movie keeps churning out perplexing images and leaves us in a state of confusion the entire running time until this alternate reality is finally resolved . i don  t think these movies are that entertaining  by their very nature  to begin with  but  ss  is rock  bottom cheap trash cinema any way you slice it . the visuals  the script  the acting and the attempt at any originality all are throwaway afterthoughts to movies like this . plus  it  s pg    so it doesn  t even deliver the gore or ta to sustain it as a guilty pleasure  even the unrated version is tame  . i had heard that the movie contained some  hot  shower scene between dushku  sagemiller . as the movie fell apart in front of me and all other entertainment seemed to be lost i found myself waiting patiently for the shower scene  at least i would get something out of this . then it comes the two girls get paint on their shirts  they jump in the shower fully clothed and scrub it off . that  s it . people thought this was hot   soul survivors  is one of those drop  dead boring movies that is so weak and inept that it is hard to have any feelings at all toward it . it puts out nothing and is hardly worth writing about . in the end it leaves us empty . carpenter  s finale is a mess of flashing light and pounding sound and that  s probably the most lively part . it will no doubt be making the rounds as a late night staple on usa or the sci  fi channel  due to it  s low cost and pg    rating  and that  s probably best for it .  ,0
i  ve seen hundreds of silent movies . some will always be classics  such as nosferatu  metropolis  the general and wings  but among them  my favorite is this film  it may not be the best   but a favorite  yes  . in fact  when i looked it up on imdb  i noticed i immediately laughed to myself because the movie was so gosh  darn cute and well  made . marion davies proved with this movie she really had great talent and was not just william randolph hearst  s mistress .  br    br   the story involves a hick from georgia coming to hollywood with every expectation that she would be an instant star  her experiences and the interesting cameos of stars of the era make this a real treat for movie buffs and a must  see   ,1
as an engineer  i must say this show  s first season started out very promising . most of the applied mathematics were somewhat plausible  and the relationships portrayed between the eppes brothers and father gave the show an interesting edge .  br    br   but after the first season  the show started degrading  heavily . most of the mathematics and technology used in crime solving is now utter gibberish and very laughable to all people involved in science  technology for real .  br    br   the involvement from the actors still feels okay and i can imagine a fair amount of money is still going into producing each episode  but in the end  this has degraded to a very unpleasantly tasting dish which is a mix of a grade c action thriller and csi style cop show .  br    br   if you are gonna watch it  go for only the first season and possibly parts of the second . thereafter i would not waste my time . myself  i gave the show up midway through season  .  br    br   season    stars season    stars season    stars  br    br   let  s sum that up to  stars . since charlie doesn  t know his math anymore  i won  t bother with the correctness of mine either .  ,0
i have never understood the appeal of this show . the acting is poor  debra jo rupp being a notable exception   the plots of most episodes are trite and uninspiring  the dialogue is weak  the jokes unfunny and it is painful to try and sit through even half an episode . furthermore the link between this show and the    s  is extremely tenuous beyond the style of dress and the scenery and background used for the show  it seems to be nothing more than a modern sitcom with the same old unfunny  clichd scripts that modern sitcoms have dressed up as depicting a show from twenty years ago in the hope that it will gain some nostalgic viewers or something like that . both  happy days  and  the wonder years  employ the same technique much more effectively and are actually a pleasure to watch in contrast to this horrible  pathetic excuse for a show  ,0
wonderful film that mixes documentary and fiction in a way that makes the spectator question what is the extent of truth in documentary films or is there such a thing as an objective documentary .  ,1
what do you get if you cross the matrix with the truman show   br    br   i  m sure you  ve all seen the matrix by now . the creators of the matrix say that it is  anime inspired  . just from watching the trailer to this classic  you can see where they took the plot from .  br    br   the film is sort of set in     s japan  and it really shows . the costumes  music and words  in the recent english language version by ad vision  are all like they  ve been directly lifted from the era . i believe it was made in that time also  but due to certain plot points  this doesn  t date the film   br    br   as you probably guessed by my referencing to the matrix  the world isn  t real . it  s not really the      s . in fact  it  s something more like the      s . after a nuclear war  the earth  or  biosphere prime    s ecosystem was destroyed . the survivors we  re forced to escape into space  where the conflict continued . once the planets  or  biospheres   were all abandoned  people began to live in megazones  cities inside of spaceships  where  via hypnotism techniques and truman show  esque illusion  they were made to believe they we  re back on earth  in the most peaceful time in recent memory . . . the     s . when young shogo obtains a mysterious advanced looking motorcycle  it leads him to find out more than he  s supposed to know . . . the garland  a bike which becomes a mech   a weapon from the      s  aids shogo in his escape from the pursuing military . as more and more is discovered about the megazone  the war comes closer to home  and due to conflicts between the military and the computer  the war comes to the megazone too . . . i apologise if those points are seen as spoilers  but the plot is outlined basically that way on the synopsis .  br    br   emotions run high in this movie  moreso than the matrix . you really do believe the war is going on  and shogo really does become quite scarred by what he  s discovering . what starts off as an uber  happy cool    s flick becomes a tragic tale of war and unreality . these characters are real people  not the cardboard cutouts we saw flipping around in bullet  time in the matrix . there really is the sense of the suffering people can go through after being caught up in such a conspiracy  and a war . it may just choke you up towards the end . . . i know it did me .  br    br   animation is pretty impressive for it  s day  and the picture quality on the advision dvd is unbelievable for it  s age . the artwork style is beautiful and reminiscent of traditional anime  very cultural . be prepared for quite a lot of violence and blood  there  s also an erotic sex scene .  br    br   the ending can be seen as a  there can be no ending   similar to the matrix  or  supposedly can be followed by the sequel  which i haven  t yet had the pleasure of watching .  br    br   i have to say that this is one of the best animes i  ve seen  in fact  one of the best movies i  ve seen  and considered by many to be one of the greatest animes of all time .  br    br   i must recommend the advision dvd  as their take on the english language is incredible  and does the movie justice  and can be purchased with an artbox for holding the two sequels when they are released  which will have the same vocal cast .  br    br   all in all  megazone   is an incredible movie  and deserves to be held highly  and should be an essential in any anime fan  s collection . heck  even my mother enjoyed it .  ,1
this is a film that the mainstream market will probably never be able to access as it doesn  t exactly give the viewer easy watching . the story about troubled spike and his friend heaton is not exactly a friday night film yet it has its own unique edge and i found that it was entertaining . there are moments of brilliance given that the film was shot on such a low budget  such as when spike inhales the aerosol . however i did not really understand the relationship between spike and heaton and to be honest it made me spend most of the film trying to work it out . and also i did not like the fact that most of the film is spent with the two friends talking and not really much  action  . it is a small film that is complex to watch and that is what makes it appealing .  ,1
very bad . very  very bad . as a fellow who aspires to make  be in or  at least  sniff the catering table at a movie set  i find it hard to criticize independents who actually got a movie of any sort made . however  this movie . . . oh dear .  br    br   realizing frightworld doesn  t aspire to anything more than crude exploitation  an honorable thing in itself  and to try to make it conform to more mainstream standards is a mistake . and to be fair  it is more entertaining than  say  red zone cuba . . . but not by much . so i won  t try to critique  just let me ask throw out some observations .  br    br     if gore is the point of the movie  shouldn  t you be able to see it   br    br     if you have hire three sound men make sure at least one knows how to operate the equipment .  br    br     in a horror movie your lead maniac must be scarier than a smurf doll . difficult i know but really . . .  br    br     there is a lot of talented videographers in the buffalo  rochester area  most you can hire really cheap . get one who knows how to frame a scene .  br    br     just because you have someone who knows how to use after effects and other cool programs doesn  t mean he should do so every two seconds .  br    br     kudos for getting the girls to take off their tops but next time  get girls who  s tops we want to see taken off .  br    br     editing should help tell the story or set a mood . at the least in this sort of movie editing should sell the gore gags . a chainsaw suddenly appearing in a characters stomach is not scary  it  s sloppy .  br    br   some good things . not all the acting was bad . jack was pretty good and i liked acid once she started fighting back . there was some neat imagery  unfortunately it was thrown up on the screen without rhyme or reason .  acid poptart  is a name that deserves a better movie . i like the moxie of frightworld too . next time  now that they have a movie of sorts under their belts  i hope all involve aspire to something better than colman francis . upgrade at least ed wood .  ,0
i saw the the bourne ultimatum last summer with a friend  and  wow  i had already seen the first two films and i liked them  but ultimatum  i loved .  br    br   matt damon plays jason bourne  a amnesia suffering cia agent on the run  trying to discover who he is .  br    br   like i already said  i loved this movie from start to finish  no plot holes  slow scenes  everything was paced just right and it fit in well with the other films  but in all senses it was much better .  br    br   best stunts  car chases  actors  and effects i  ve seen in an action movie all summer   surprisingly due to spider  man   pirates  etc .  but i it wasn  t just action in this film  jason doesn  t just kill and run . he has a soul and the audience feels for him  so drama is included . but that doesn  t slow it down .  br    br   of all the  threequels  that came out last summer  this was the best .  ,1
by reading the box at the video store this movie looks rather amusingly disturbing . you know the type . . . . funny but supposed to frighten you . . . . this was not funny or horrific . the writing was lame . . . the jokes failed to make me laugh even at their extreme mundaneness . . . . they were so expected . the actors didn  t even do much with such a not so good script . . . at least i hope that wasn  t their best . . watch this movie at your own risk . . . . . . i give it negative  stars outta    ,0
if you want to see a movie about two utterly unsympathetic characters  this is the one . the acting is superb  both from john cassavetes as the insane paranoid whom  as the saying goes  they really are out to get  and from peter falk as his lifelong best friend to whom he turns for rescue . big mistake  but since they  re both amoral mobsters  and misogynistic bastards to boot  it  s hard to decide whom to root for less . only writer  director elaine may could have gotten away with this one . i thought it interesting that in a lengthy interview with producer michael hausman included on the dvd  he disclosed that the two stars had  very different ideas  about the script  that the director was nearly impossible to work with  that the director of photography had impossible demands made of him  that the crew was constantly angry about being made to sit around waiting  and so on . this mood of one big very dysfunctional family comes across clearly on the screen .  ,0
as gently as i can  i sincerely believe this movie is a waste of time . i did not find it the  warm  emotionally satisfying  film others did . i found it boring  with music that distracted from the film . the story was thin  the characters overdrawn  and the direction pedestrian .  br    br   fooey .  br    br   now i  m going to write some more about this movie  so i make the   line minimum . there really isn  t more to be said and brevity is important  but imdb has its minimums  so here goes .  br    br   young eager kid finds nascent talent  seeks time with aging  embittered mentor in spite of father  s cartoonish homophobia . aging  embittered mentor turns out to drink a lot and teach very little . conflict arises . while i don  t think this is a spoiler  i  ve added the warning in case someone feels this much information is too much .  br    br   mostly  i just found the film boring and pretentious . a waste of my time . i honestly don  t understand what little fuss there seems to be  mostly on this web site  about the transcendent quality of this movie . i think it  s really worth avoiding . but  as dennis miller used to say   maybe i  m wrong .   ,0
herculis puaro is  in general  a well established  hero  we know well from books and movies . this movie or this story don  t work and i felt its not agatha  s mistake . the cast isn  t good  the actors are over exaggerating and making foolish gestures  the costumes are so clean and tidy that everything  even arab clothes  look fake and for the serious spectator who thinks twice this movie can be seen as a comedy instead of mystery drama . the actor playing herculis puaro is doing a nice job but nothing fantastic . the scenes are  as said before  perfect and looking fake . the story is not very enchanting although a mystery of murder but who cares about the death of a loony and vicious blond    woman in the iraqi desert   the  victim  is not likable .  ,0
whoopi was the only reason i watched the oscars that year . she is hilarious . of course there was a major serious side to the show . she was great not only because she  s funny  but because she said some things that needed to be said in a public forum . white folks need to be reminded that hollywood awards  ceremonies  employment  and representation are way out of balance racially . there should be no need for  black  awards shows . the white  bread  milquetoast nominators and judges need to bring their heads into the sunshine and see that great material is not limited to  white  directors  producers  actors  etc . allowing woody allen on the air was the depth of poor taste . he had no business being there . the fact of the matter is  this is the first oscar presentation i  ve watched since  the color purple  was up for awards . that miscarriage of voting soured me on watching the shows until     . which is not to denigrate other presenters . billy crystal is a riot .  ,1
if you want to learn the basics of quantum mechanics  spend your   on a used textbook  not this movie . i  m a little worried that the money i spent is being used to buy kool  aid for shipment to guyana .  br    br   i don  t think the directors really got any point across  but it looks like maybe they were trying to make several   science can explain everything we do  meaning that our lives are deterministic   science can  t be used to explain everything we do  meaning that we have free will   science is  like  really cool  brother   we are god   the world exists only in our minds   sarah norman is a tough role to follow and   here  put this tiny paper square in your mouth and you  ll see some really groovy stuff .  ,0
i hope the viewer who regards  dream machine  as one of corey haim  s finest and the  best movies of the century  was kidding . undetected sarcasm on my part  i sincerely hope so .  br    br    the dream machine  marks the first of a long line of mediocre capers that would plague the rest of corey haim  s career  except  prayer of the rollerboys  which was surprisingly decent  . here  haim plays nonchalant college boy  bernie  who supposes that a cool car will attract his dream girl  s attention . lucky for bernie  a rich woman aiming to get back at her cheating husband  hastily decides to reward her faithful piano tuner   bernie   with a gift a slick porsche turbo . however  unbeknownst to the woman  and unfortunate for bernie  is that her dead husband was murdered and his body was hidden in the trunk . now  being that in this movie  bodies don  t seem to decay or possess a rather foul funk  bernie is unaware of this . in fact  the oblivious boy has no idea that something suspicious is afoot despite several odd circumstances that arise . in particular  a grizzly man follows him around  desperate to get hold of that body relatively undetected .  br    br   this is a low  grade action fizzle as many of haim  s films like this are  see the double o kid  . despite being part action  part romantic comedy  this movie fails to offer the viewer much of anything of interest for at least the first forty  five minutes in which the filmmakers take more than enough time to show the immediate problem  i . e . bernie being in possession of a car and a dead body  and a hit  man finding out that the porsche is going to be hard to find  . after which  and thanks to poor acting by haim  i loved this kid  too  but it  s not exactly sacrilegious to admit the times when he obviously couldn  t act well  and the lack of real immediacy and emergency between bernie and the villain that makes much of the events unconvincing and as a result  inappreciable . to add injury to insult  the soundtrack was unbelievably laughable and sounded more like self  evident songs you would hear in team america  see the  date  montage  .  br    br   loyal corey haim fans  however  should not be disappointed to see their boy in abundance . however  others understanding that haim  s career probably peaked when he was   or   and never recovered  might expect mediocrity  as will viewers just looking for early   s b  comedy fluff to pass the time .  ,0
contains some spoilers this movie is cheesy   s horror in all its awfulness . the plot takes way too long to get off the ground  never steadies itself  and then just plain crashes about   minutes into the film . there are a few gem moments for zombie fans  but not nearly enough zombies to create a real sense of terror .  br    br   the zombies also take a long time to make their appearance . first  there  s a whole half of a movie about mobs and prison gangs . the hero of the movie is an ex  vietnam vet who gets caught up in the mob . the main mob boss sets him up and he goes to jail . in this jail  they are experimenting on the prisoners to find a way to cure them of homicidal tendencies and criminal behavior . but the badie psychotic head scientist  military guy has other plans in mind . he wants to use a slightly different version of the serum to make . . . . da da da . . . . super soldiers  after some infected prisoners kill a few guards and most of the prison has a round of infected communion wine  the military  crazy scientist guy goes  hey this might be a problem  and gives a call to the genius scientist turned investigative journalist hot babe ultra  empowered independent woman character  who of course invented the original serum . she goes to the prison to see what  s going down  the military guy calls in a few swat teams from his secure position outside the prison  and the hero guy takes charge of the few prisoners with a heart of gold when a riot breaks out . the hero guy and the scientist  journalist lady team up to find a cure  save the warden  s kids  and deal with some irate prisoners  both infected and not . meanwhile  the mob boss guy has made a deal to get into the prison so that he can save his imprisoned brother . the military gets ready to blow the place up  and everyone inside scrambles to find a way out .  br    br   there are a lot of gory scenes where people are killed by being pressed or pulled through prison bars . there  s also a creepy decapitation scene and electrocution scene involving the same infected rasta prisoner . still  the most disturbing scene is in the early part of the film  when a gross corrupt guard rapes a prisoner .  br    br   the main highlight of this film is one scene towards the end . the hero  woman  and kids are trying to make their way to the only escape route . their path leads them to a long hallway  on one side there is a wall and on the other are prison bars . hundreds of bloody zombie hands reach through  gracing their hair and faces as they pass by . there  s also a few good scenes of the classic  couple of zombies munching on freshly dead bodies  and  many zombies ripping one guy to shreds  bits .  br    br   overall  worth watching if you  re researching the zombie genre as it has so many zombie clichs worth noting it  s practically an instruction manual on what not to do when making a zombie movie . but if you  re new to zombie flicks and want a real scare  you should look elsewhere .  ,0
the first time i saw this movie  i fell in love with it . the atmosphere was what caught my attention first and foremost . i expected a gore fest  but instead got to watch a highly intelligent killer mess with my head to a chilling soundtrack  it  s actually my ringer at the moment p  . the fact that i couldn  t predict when he  d kill and when he  d disappear was a major plus in my book . predictable horror movies bore me . now  i know the storyline had some discrepancies  but  if you  re like me  you don  t even notice them until long after the movie  s over and you  re laying in bed mauling over the fact that you just witnessed a masterpiece in motion . finally  as i mentioned  the soundtrack is timeless . it  s one of my all time favorite theatrical scores  so i was very happy to hear that rob zombie is leaving it untouched in his remake . speaking of the remake  i read a very comprehensive article on it and  now that i know that mr . zombie reveres john carpenter  i have high hopes for his take on this classic . this movie is great for any time you have a craving for a spine tingling  but it  s the perfect addition  opener  finale  you name it for an all hallow  s eve movie marathon .    ,1

as usual  i am making a mad dash to see the movies i haven  t watched yet in anticipation of the oscars . i was really looking forward to seeing this movie as it seemed to be right up my alley . i can not for the life of me understand why this movie has gotten the buzz it has . there is no story   a group of guys meander around iraq . one day they are here diffusing a bomb . tomorrow they are tooling around the countryside  by themselves no less and start taking sniper fire . no wait here they are back in bagdad . there is no cohesive story at all . the three main characters are so overly characterized that they are mere caricatures . by that i mean  we have the sweet kid who is afraid of dying . we have the hardened military man who is practical and just wants to get back safe . and then we have the daredevil cowboy who doesn  t follow the rules but has a soft spot for the precocious little iraqi boy trying to sell soldiers dvds . what do you think is going to happen    well  do you think the cowboy soldier who doesn  t follow rules is going to get the sweet kid injured with his renegade ways   why yes  do you think the iraqi kid that cowboy soldier has a soft spot for is going to get killed and make him go crazy  why yes  there is no story here . the script is juvenile and predictable  the camera is shaken around a lot to make it look  artsy  . and for all of you who think this is such a great war picture  go rent  full metal jacket    deerhunter  or  platoon  . don  t waste time or money on this boring movie   ,0
after a promising first   minutes that makes you feel all warm inside  you  re pretty convinced that this will be a great romantic comedy . then the movie takes a turn for the worse .  br    br   the warm feeling might still be there  but as others has said the plot becomes so unbelievable and artificial that it  s almost unbearable to watch .  br    br   the movie gets sped up  and you get the impression that you  re either fast forwarding through it  or that the producers decided to fit it in less than  h   m and had to cut a lot of scenes out .  br    br   realism isn  t a goal onto itself  but as a viewer  i  m pretty convinced that this comedy isn  t intentionally unrealistic  it just happens to be .  br    br   on the plus side  this movie has a couple of nice interiors  and despite the bad script  i think that the actors performances are mainly good . if i could rate the first   minutes only  i  d probably give it an eight . as it is now  it gets a four . . . . and that  s being nice   br    br   if you  re a sucker for romantic comedies you  ll probably have a great time anyways . if not  i  d recommend that you watch something else .  ,0
corbin bernsen gives a terrifically intense and riveting performance as dr . alan feinstone  a wealthy and successful beverly hills dentist who  s obsessed with perfection . when he discovers that his lovely blonde babe trophy wife has been cheating on him and the irs start hounding him about tax problems  feinstone cracks under the pressure and goes violently around the bend . director brian yuzna  working from a suitably dark  witty and demented script by stuart gordon  dennis paoli  and charles finch  exposes the seething neurosis and psychosis bubbling underneath the squeaky clean well  manicured surface of respectable affluent rich america with deliciously malicious glee . moreover  yuzna further spices up the grisly goings on with a wickedly twisted sense of pitch black gallows humor . bernsen positively shines as dr . feinstone he expertly projects a truly unnerving underlying creepiness that  s right beneath feinstone  s deceptively calm and assured veneer . the supporting cast are likewise excellent linda hoffman as feinstone  s bitchy  unfaithful wife brooke  earl boen as smarmy  meddlesome irs agent marvin goldblum  molly hagan as feisty assistant jessica  patty toy as perky assistant karen  jan hoag as jolly office manager candy  virginya keehne as sweet  gawky teenager sarah  ken foree as thorough  no  nonsense detective gibbs  tony noakes as gibbs  equally shrewd partner detective sunshine  michael stadvec as womanizing stud muffin pool cleaner matt  and mark ruffalo as on the make sleazeball steve landers . the first  rate make  up f  x are every bit as gory  gross and upsetting as they ought to be . the polished cinematography by levie isaaks boasts lots of great crazy tilted camera angles and a few tasty zoom  in close  ups . alan howarth  s spirited shuddery score also hits the flesh  crawling spot . an enjoyably warped treat .  ,1
terry west had a good idea w this movie . he just didn  t flesh it thru . there are endless shots of the creepy looking school  s exteriors that go on forever and probably to pad the film  s running time . also at this school there are only  students . misty mundae is good as usual but this film will always belong to ruby larocca  which is the only reason to watch the film in the beginning  . if the script centered on her interesting character we  d have a movie to watch . she is so gorgeous   good news for dvd buyers  terry west  s earlier  and better  film  blood for the muse  is a special feature . one thing i  d like to say is that this movie feels like someone who  s not good at delivering the punch line at the end of a long joke for the ending feels that very same way . then again  just watch this for ruby larocca .  ,0
in all my years of film  going  only once have i walked out on a film  and that was the dreadful  stay tuned .  fortunately  the cinema refunded the ticket and i went to see  buffy the vampire slayer  instead  a minor improvement  . that film is  gone with the wind  compared to  dick   a comedy so unfunny that it nearly became the second film i ever walked out of .  dick  was so unfunny it was even impossible to laugh at it  let alone laugh with it .  br    br   granted  paying to see a movie with a title like  dick  suggests that it will be filled with inane  dick  jokes and wind up a huge letdown  and yet i had high hopes because of the notable cast  daniel hedaya  bruce mccullough  dave foley  kristen dunst  etc .  etc .  and a premise that at least promised something fresh . what the film delivered was  as portended  four woefully predictable  dick  jokes  comic timing suffering from jetlag  and a premise that wore thin after the first five minutes . in short  it was the watergate scene from  forrest gump  stretched   nay  laid on a rack and mangled   over    excruciating minutes .  br    br   as soon as you understand that the two main characters   airless  insipid squealers who gasp and roll eyeballs incessantly   will participate in every major watergate event  you begin to mentally check off the plot as it progresses   and a half minutes erased from the nixon tapes  check the deep throat meetings with woodward and bernstein  check john dean getting a change of heart and testifying  check . the process drags out more languidly and about as engaging as the real watergate affair with about as much laugh  getting to boot . and though it posits to be an amusing re  deconstruction of the events leading to president nixon  s resignation  it turns into a paint  by  the  numbers  choose  your  own  adventure  fill  in  the  blanks comedy that says very little and entertains even less .  br    br   even the film  s strong point   the aforementioned cast   is bewilderingly unproductive here . the most disappointing of all is harry shearer as g . gordon liddy . trapped as he is behind the thick liddy moustache and strait  jacketed in this numbingly morose screenplay  shearer mumbles a few lines  tries desperately to leer from behind the prosthetic nose and eyebrows  then disappears . dave foley  one of the comic masterminds from kids in the hall  two others  bruce mccullough and mark mckinney also appear in this film   ah  the blessings of nepotism  fares badly as well . his h . r . haldeman occasionally lends a much  need lightening of the funeral plot  but the funniest thing about him is the buzz  cut he sports   perhaps the films funniest bit of all . and then there  s daniel hedaya as richard nixon   oops  i mean  dick .   ha ha how amusingly funny .  he manages to play a solid nixon  avoiding the pitfalls  such as overdone make up  rubbery nose and false teeth a la anthony hopkins  while preserving the essence  the vacillations between human tenderness and coarseness  . i seem to be forgetting someone . . . oh yes  the two stars of the film  those over  bubbly teenagers . can  t remember their names  perhaps because i have repressed their performances . nothing could be farther from funny nothing could be more painful than having to endure their deliverly that ran the gamut of  hyperactive  and  super  hyperactive  with an occasional  pouty  tossed in .  br    br   this film seemed to be a bad excuse to string together a   s soundtrack and parade outrageous period clothing  both of which seem to be the norm these days for films and tv shows set in the  me decade .  but the clothes and the music wind up being an ersatz substitute for true characterization and plot  a kind of extra  plot shorthand that the producers hope will compensate for anemic writing .  br    br   the only possible use for this film is years down the road when any one of its talented cast appears on david letterman or conan o  brien . this dreadful cinematic excretion will be dragged out to embarrass and hopefully humble the stunned guest star . the sad thing is that the real bad guys in all this   the writers and producers   will be far from the cameras gaze  possibly cooking up another disaster such as this .  br    br    ,0
i saw this film when it was first released . the memory of how bad it was has stayed with me almost forty years . i didn  t want to trust my own sentiments about the movie when i saw it  so i consulted a movie review published in a major metropolitan newspaper the next day  sentiment confirmed  the reviewer wrote that the movie was incoherent  indecipherable  and uninspiring . a little research reveals that the producer was star leslie caron  s husband  thus the whiff of nepotism suggests the beginning for this awful film . the film  s roster of many capable actors  caron  warren oates  scatman crothers  gloria grahame  and james sikking among others  suggests that it holds some promise . but the death of this film is attributable to its terrible screenplay . the  mystery  implicated is so obscure and so little revealed throughout the film that the viewer is left perplexed from scene to scene . the movie seems torn between being a detective mystery and an espionage thriller  but never settles upon one or the other . the sense of suspense is entirely absent . the main characters settle on playing dry  emotionless types in a fashion that inspires no empathy whatsoever . the cinematography is pedestrian . the result is that the hapless viewer loses interest in the characters  the plot  and  in the end  the film itself . i am little surprised that there is no version of this pathetic film available to purchase . i hope that if tcm finds a print of this film and feels compelled to air it that it is safely relegated to the     am slot .  ,0
i have not seen each and every one of chans movies  but this is for sure the best one i have seen so far .  br    br   the story in it self is nothing special really  so i wont go deeper into that . what makes it special is the stunts  the fighting  the good acting  the warm sense of humor . the movie has a raging tempo all the way through and you are just stunned seeing it . all the cool stunts  of course made by jackie himself  makes you want jump around in the couch and scream . its just awesome  even my mom was impressed by this cool movie when she saw it .  br    br   i know this police story can be a bit hard to get a hold of  at least it is here in sweden . but i can assure you  its worth a try .  ,1
freeway killer  is a madman who shoots people on the freeway while yelling a bunch of mystical chant on a car phone . the police believe he is a random killer  but sunny  the blond heroine  played by darlanne fluegel detects a pattern . so does the ex  cop  played by james russo  and they join forces  and bodies  in the search for the villain who has done away with their spouses . also starring richard belzer  this movie has its moments especially if you like car chases  but its really not a good movie for the most part  check it out if you  re really bored and have already seen the hitcher  joy ride  or breakdown  otherwise stay away from the freeway .  ,0
definitely the product of young minds  this piece may very well appeal to the   s crowd  who is still trying to find their place in the world  while obsessing over every neurosis . however  i can  t imagine that the heavy amount of narcissistic navel  gazing  trite humor  or banal subject matter would be particularly engaging to anyone over   . another problem is that the peripheral characters  whom the filmmakers obviously have nothing but contempt for  are hyped up to such absurd caricatures for comic effect  that they fail to be relatable in any real way .  br    br   however  one has to give some style points to the filmmakers  who obviously grew up in the video generation  and use every conceivable editing trick in the book in order to spruce up an otherwise non  existent plot . there are  points to remember here . first  beware of festival darlings . second  even though we live in the age of youtube  not everyone  s account of their mundane lives deserves big  screen treatment . but these young filmmakers have every right to make their film  and if others    somethings can find something in it to identify with  then all the better . yet i could not help but think at the end of this film how this latest generation  just now coming of age  will fare in the real world that presents so many challenges and complications . in the age when every child is constantly reassured of how special they are  and that they all deserve their   minutes of exposure  resiliency and the ability to deal with adversity does not exactly appear to be this generation  s strong point .  ,0

though i did not begin to read the  classics  in literature until i was    it  s never too late . jane eyre is a favorite for many reasons  mainly because there isn  t a part of the book i liked less  only parts i enjoyed more . the     tv mini  series with zelah clarke and timothy dalton was everything i hoped it would be . i saw it as a full length movie in     . dalton  s  mr . rochester  was very good but i absolutely loved zelah  s  jane eyre  . relecting on another  classics  movie i saw recently  i was disappointed in the production  direction and dialogue . it was only faithful to the avarice and arrogance of hollywood . artistic license to the great works in literature is nothing short of plagiarism . using the title after such license is fraud . leave it to the brits to get this one right  among others  . you won  t be able to reread the book without reliving the movie with it  s proper context and spirit . well done bbc .  ,1
i won  t give anything away by describing the plot of this film other than to say that it begins with the return to israel of a young blind woman whose closest friend and companion has just committed suicide . it unfolds like a detective story as the blind woman tries to figure out why her friend ended her life . as she pursues her investigation and the information accumulates  it leads inexorably to a devastating conclusion . the film is expertly paced and the acting  especially by talia sharon as ya  ara  the blind woman  is excellent . israeli film has definitely come of age and is now fully competitive with other foreign films  though few have found a large audience in the u . s .  ,1
since i watched it for the first time   piedras  is a personal favorite and one of the few pictures i actually could watch over and over again . the great screenplay depicts the lives of a bunch of women  all of them somehow interconnected  with deep understanding and sensibility . ramn salazar achieved a compelling film in his directorial debut  and proves himself as an efficient actors  director .  br    br   not that all performances are excellent  though . of all leading ladies  they range from average  najwa nimri  to very good  vicky pea   but the standing ovation should be directed to newcomer mnica cervera  who convincingly plays antonia san juan  s retarded daughter . enrique alcides is irresistibly charming as the girl  s male nurse  and there are nice small turns from andrs gertrdix  geli albaladejo and the director himself  ramn salazar .  br    br    piedras  is beautifully written and filmed  when i watched it i got so moved that i couldn  t stop thinking of it for days . i highly recommend it .  ,1

it was and a simpler time  the seventies   a simpler place  san francisco   where a man could make a simple movie about a drug crazed psychotic re  crucifixion of christ as a woman on acid with never ending dream sequences and inter cut flashbacks while having a multi  racial inter gender orgies regardless of financial responsibilities or moral repercussion .  br    br   this movie  tedious  slow  boring  is the worst example of the kind of pretentious heavy handed art school dreck that passed as art in the midst of the    s . and i love it  once this train wreck of endless slow motion zoom ins and heavy reverbed echo chamber acid guitar licks starts you can  t take your eyes off of it until the ridiculous and absurd end . its kind of a cross between jesus christ superstar  beyond the valley of the dolls  and a really crappy acid trip with your parents on a water bed . its simultaneously a train wreck  completely fascinating  and also a great snapshot of the worst  or best  elements of b  grade seventies phychadelic film genre .  br    br   the plot .  br    br   i  ll just tell you the plot because you will hardly be able to tell whats happening due to the constant cross edited flashbacks to events that may or may not have happened to characters that may or may not be themselves  and the face painted hippy freak nicks endlessly cavorting about in banal sequences of performance art level mime like street theater .  br    br    logan  is a really annoying iconoclast film maker who yells at people allot and is surrounded by a mostly silent film crew who are always dropping acid and having what seem like really bad orgies . richard dreyfus has an ancillary role as what seems like the accountant . the film crew seems to hate him for some reason and break out into maniacal laughter perhaps to torment him .  suzanne  the titular character is a willowy blond who stairs vacuously into space and comforts the totally insane  artist  character .  the artist  is going completely mad  by the way . either from his hamfisted overacting or the incredible awfulness of his paintings . all of course terrible nudes of susanne . there are some other characters that randomly show up  a cigar chomping  the man  character . who also is all hot for suzanne i guess . he has a monologue . i couldn  t really ever figure out what he had to do with the story except everyone had to hate  the man  back then and you couldn  t make a movie without one . there is also a mute girl . the mute girl pays off in the end trust me  its incredibly stupid .  ,0

this woman who works as an intern for a photographer goes home and takes a bath where she discovers this hole in the ceiling . so she goes to find out that her neighbor above her is a photographer . this movie could have had a great plot but then the plot drains of any hope . the problem i had with this movie is that every ten seconds  someone is snorting heroin . if they took out the scenes where someone snorts heroin  then this would be a pretty good movie . every time i thought that a scene was going somewhere  someone inhaled the white powder . it was really lame to have that much drug use in one movie . it pulled attention from the main plot and a great story about a photographer . the lesbian stuff didn  t bother me . i was looking for a movie about art . i found a movie about drug use .  ,0
you will marvel at the incredibly sophisticated computer animation  and the novelty probably won  t wear off on the first  second or third viewing  but you  ll be drawn in by the characters which are so simple yet intriguing  that you may find yourself actually caring for them in an unexpected way  which may or may not make you feel a little childish due to the medium .  br    br   disney continues to firmly hold the title of  greatest animation in the world   with  a bug  s life  standing as one of their greatest achievements . one of the innovative attachments being the delightful  out  takes  added to the end of the film . the dvd has two sets of these out  takes where as i  m told the vhs cassette has one alternating version per tape . the dvd also features  gerry  s game  which is a delightful little pixar short that was also shown prior to the film in theaters .  br    br   this is by far the superior insect  film in comparison to dreamworks   antz   which in all fairness is pretty good  but lacks something in the animation and in the story development and characters . if you look at the star voices of both films   antz  is largely cast with big name  movie  stars with a few familiar  tv  star voices  where  a bug  s life  is just the opposite  loaded with  tv  stars with kevin spacey as the only stand out exception . but the difference in quality is distinct and obvious .  br    br   dreamworks can  t be blamed or surprised though  when you go head to head with disney  you have your work cut out for you . this is the kind of film that almost makes me wish i had children to share it with . don  t think for a second that this is just a movie for kids  though .  ,1

the story  line of  the thief of bagdad  is complex  owing to its being told in flashbacks and having three separate and equally important strands woven together . the screenplay by lajo biros and the dialogue by miles malleson keep the story moving skillfully at all points . the young king ahmad of bagdad is angry at his vizier jaffar for executing a man for having different ideas . he discovers while in disguise that people blame him for jaffar  s deeds and hate him . he is imprisoned by jaffar  where he meets abu the young thief . the two escape and take a boat to the city of basra . there the companions spy when men clear the way so none will see the princess of the city passing by . ahmad falls in love with her and visits her in her garden . he tells her he has come to her from beyond time and wins a kiss . then he is captured . when jaffar comes to win the princess of basra for himself  ahmad attacks the evil vizier who blinds him and turns abu into a dog . jaffar then asks for the princess  s hand  and he gives the gift of a mechanical flying horse to the sultan of basra . the blind ahmad then tells his tale in the marketplace  accompanied by abu as his dog . the prince has fallen into a sleep and nothing can wake her . so jaffar sends his servant halima for ahmad and the dog  in hopes the prince can rouse her . he does awaken her . she boards a ship to find a doctor to cure ahmad  but she is captured by jaffar who then throws the dog overboard . she then allows jaffar to take her in his arms  on his promise to restore ahmad  s sight and turn abu back into a thief . the princess sees a vision of ahmad he is in a boat jaffar sends a storm to beset him and abu is shipwrecked on a deserted island . abu finds a genie or djinn who wants to kill him now that he is free after many centuries spent imprisoned in a bottle . abu tricks him into proving he really came from so small a vessel  then corks him in again . for freeing him  he gets three wishes . his first is for sausages . in the meanwhile  the princess pleads with her father to refuse jaffar but jaffar shows the sultan a new mechanical toy  one of whose six arms stabs him to death . abu makes a second wish  to find ahmad . the cunning genie flies him to the goddess of the all  seeing eye . abu has to climb a great web to get to the gem that is the eye  battling a giant spider  then scaling the goddess  s statue . abu gazes into the  eye  and sees ahmad in a canyon . he has the genie take him to ahmad . ahmad uses the eye to see the princess . she smells a flower and forgets everything at once . abu wishes they were in bagdad  but the genie laughs and leaves jaffar tells the princess that she is in love with him  omitting mention of ahmad . ahmad tries to fight his way to the princess  but jaffar smashes the  eye  . abu finds himself in the  land of legend   where the old men who rule want to make him their king . he steals a bow and a magic carpet and escapes instead  to hurry to save ahmad and the princess . the thief arrives in time to save the young king from the executioner  using his bow from the flying carpet  to the wonder of the throng who had come to watch the execution . jaffar tries to flee on the mechanical flying horse  but another shot from the bow finishes him . ahmad is ruler again and plans to wed his princess but when he tries to make abu his vizier  the young thief refuses  saying that what he wants is adventure  not hard work and confinement in a palace however grand it may be . this fantastic story was given a sumptuous production by producer alexander korda . the production was designed by vincent korda who was also art director  while georges perinal did the colorful cinematography . the directors credited are ludwig berger and michael powell  with tim whelan  alexander korda  william cameron menzies and zoltan korda participating . the extraordinary and numerous costumes designs were the work of john armstrong  oliver messel and marcel vertes . the production  apart from its gorgeous and expensive  looking visual splendors  i claim is dominated by two other elements  the choral music of miklos rozsa and the performance by conrad veidt as the evil jaffar . rex ingram plays the genie with a curious accent  plus his usual intelligence and power . june duprez is lovely and effective as the princess mary morris is a sad and beautiful halima  and miles malleson a properly bumbling and avaricious sultan . as ahmad  john justin appears to do most of what can be done with the part of a young prince in love and then some he is memorably good in his winning role . this film has a spaciousness about it that is found  i assert  in other korda works also . its imaginative content stands in contrast to very  strong realistic sets  costumes and set  design elements . this is one of the most memorable idea  level fantasies of all time  worthy to be enjoyed over and over .  ,1
if dick tracy was in black and white  the pope wouldn  t be religious . giving a new sense to the concept of color in a movie  we are offered an unique experience throughout a comic  strip world  and it  s one of the few movies which succeeded in doing so  thanks to a serious script  good direction  great performances  al pacino is astonishing  and most importantly a powerful mix of cinematography  art direction and costume design . using only primary colors  the experience is quite different from anything we have seen before . and there is also a quite successful hommage to all the gangster  movie genre  pratically extinct from modern cinema . overall  i see this movie as a fresh attempt and a touch of originality to a cinema which relies more and more on the old and already  seen formulas .  out of   .  ,1
i read the book and really enjoyed it from beginning to end . however  when i saw the movie i was very disappointed . first of all  no disrespect to deborah raffin but she was too mature to play a woman of      . the late christopher reeve was also miscast  same reason . will  according to the book  was around   . i would have love to see a little more exploration of his military life  his friend red  elly  s trip to see him as that was an important part of the characters  storyline development . also miss beasley was miscast as the book mentioned her being a plus size lady . i know the movie didn  t have the budget of the  bridges of madison county  which i believe was released around the same time .  br    br   but to me this was a very poorly made  low budget  miscast movie . as someone mentioned  i wish that miss spenser would come out of retirement and write screenplays for her books as they ought to be . she knows her characters better than anyone  i hope that she would consider doing the casting too . the movie let me down   ,0
after seeing the poster from the film smother  i knew i was about to live one of those intolerable film experiences which make me want to take my eyes out . however  i felt a slight optimism because the movie had a solid cast which i thought it was going to rescue the movie . unfortunately that did not happen . smother is a horrible movie  but it is not execrable . that is the best i can say about it .  br    br   the screenplay from smother  written by the same guys from license to wed  something which explains they have anything but talent for writing movies  is full of cheap and predictable humor . seriously  i did not laugh even once watching this film . besides  the solid cast i previously mentioned is absolutely wasted . after the big number of garbage she has been involved in  like the monumentally atrocious and execrable because i said so   some people may think the career from diane keaton is extinguishing . however  it is impossible for me to forget the excellent performances she has brought in previous decades  on films like annie hall or baby boom . on smother  she makes her best effort with her performance  but her character is so horribly written she cannot do anything with it . dax shepard has left on me a good impression with his solid performances on the films baby mama and idiocracy . however  he does what he can with his character . mike white also makes a good effort  but he does not reach too far away . he is a very talented screenwriter  like he has shown on films like the good girl and school of rock   so i would have liked to see he was one of the screenwriters from this movie  instead of only acting on it . liv tyler suffers from the same situation of all the previously mentioned actors  being wasted .  br    br   the worst fail from smother is being absolutely boring and unfunny . its screenplay is nothing more than a collection of forced scenes and situations we have seen on sit  coms . stay far away from this crappy comedy .  ,0
  capites de abril  is a very good . the story isn  t a documentary about the     revolution in portugal . but it gives us an idea of how it was like . the fiction of the story isn  t of great interest  but it doesn  t spoil the movie . the heroic actions of captain salgueiro maia aren  t exaggerations and the film is also a tribute for his deeds . captain salgueiro maia remains one of the greatest heroes of the   th of april revolution .  br    br   all the actors are very good and even the smallest roles are played wonderfully . lisbon looks beautiful as ever . don  t miss it  i liked this film very much .  ,1
it is an almost ideal romantic anime  must see for all ages  but the english dubbed version is not too good . perhaps the     version will be better .  ,1
not many reviews  hence thought i would add one .  br    br   do not go by the other reviews  this was a excellent movie .  br    br   rks is one of the very few indian directors that can actually put together a really good movie .  br    br   ab and akshay given yet another example of great acting  as does bhoomika too  which was a little unexpected  but great to watch .  br    br   am surprised there has not been much hype around release .  br    br   or filmfare  other awards nominations  considering how good the movie was .  br    br   better then khakee i thought and i thought khakkee too was good movie .  br    br   is a fairly long movie  but definitely worth it and while watching it  definitely does seem long .  br    br   cant wait for rks next movie and the next ab  akshay movie they always seem to do well together . . . e . g . waqt .  br    br   bhoomika too has acted really well in the movie and should do really well if she continue in the same fashion in the future .  ,1
anyone who doesn  t think bill and ted  s bogus journey is one of the greatest movies of all time needs their head checked . it somehow manages to be both completely inane and no  brainer  but also terrifying knowing and clever at the same time . one of those rare films that actually improves upon it predecessor  bogus journey can be enjoyed again and again . notable highlights include the duel with death and the ending  which is highly  emotional  . keanu wants to forget all that matrix rubbish and get down to doing what he does best  ted theodore logan in bill and ted the return .  ,1
sure it takes place in the west  but the title makes it seem like it is a conventional western . instead  it is a movie of a woman sheriff . make no mistake though this is a bad movie about a woman sheriff . she becomes sheriff when her husband is gunned down she is only a tad bit upset by this . her main goal is to go after the villain who is also a woman  but the villain hires a guy to kill her . so this is what happens  the hero falls in love with the killer and vice versa . utterly stupid  as anyone killed in this movie has the new sheriff to thank . she had more than a few chances to put the killer behind bars  but i guess because she liked him she wouldn  t do it . the killer is also after the mayor of the town for personal reasons that are also rather dumb . this movie is very boring and not really worth watching . . . it is not one of the better episodes of mst     they made . i can not imagine anyone seeing this without them because that would make it that much more painful . corman is a low budget director  but even he should know better than to have people go into one place and coming out another .  ,0
this is at least the third remake of this movie so if while watching it  there is a sense of deja vu  don  t be surprised . all they did was change the setting of the story and tell it differently but the differences are not significant . and it doesn  t get any better because the plot is flawed to begin with . it never works . and like its predecessors  the acting is mediocre .  br    br   the plot has a unique ending which will surprise any one who has never seen the movie before but the ending doesn  t fit the story . had this movie ended ten minutes earlier  it would have worked and have been very satisfying and i would have thought it more worthwhile . but here is the spoiler and that in the end crime does pay because the criminal is not caught . i never like this message resulting from a movie .  ,0
what is wrong with you people  if you weren  t blown away by the action car sequences and jessica simpsons hot body then you are majorly screwed in the head . of course the film isn  t a masterpiece  i don  t think it was aiming to be . it was fun and funny  i never watched the show when i was younger  i only recently saw one episode  and when i watched the movie  i felt it had the same kind of atmosphere . the movie seats were practically shaking  and the car sequences were good because it didn  t bore me and drag out like some of the scenes in  fast  furious . and jessica simpson is plain hot  i just wish they had used her more in the action sequences . all in all  i had a hell of a time watching this and i would go and see it again soon and i will buy it on dvd . people  enjoy it for what it is .  ,1
massacre is a film directed by andrea bianchi  burial ground  and produced by legendary italian horror director lucio fulci . now with this mix of great talent you would think this movie would have been a true gore fest . this could not be further from that . massacre falls right on its face as being one of the most boring slasher films i have seen come out of italian cinema . i was actually struggling to stay awake during the film and i have never had that problem with italian horror films .  br    br   massacre starts out with a hooker being slaughtered on the side of the road with an ax . this scene was used in fulci  s nightmare concert . this isn  t a bad scene and it raises your expectations of the movie as being an ax wielding slaughter . unfortuanitly  the next hour of the movie is so boring . the movie goes on to a set of a horror film being filmed and there is a lot of character development during all these scenes but the characters in the movie are so dull and badly acted your interest starts to leak away . the last   minutes of the movie aren  t so bad but still could have been much better . the gore in the movie was pathetic and since fulci used most of the gore scenes in nightmare concert there was nothing new here . the end of the movie did leave a nice twist but there was still to much unanswered and the continuity falls right through the floor .  br    br   this wasn  t a very good film but for a true italian horror freak  like myself  this movie is a must have since it is very rare .     stars  ,0
i figured that it  s about time i let this one out . pokmon fans are suffering in america these days . why  because we rely on kids wb and  kids entertainment to provide us with our beloved series and movies . as far as the series goes  they do a pretty good job in bringing the fun and magic of the japanese versions to television . so what is their problem when it comes to the movies  honestly now  i have seen all three pokmon movies in japanese and i will definitely be seeing the fourth one . they are excellent movies . they are all enjoyable and fun to watch . and  after seeing pokmon     in theaters  i can  t help but wonder how these american producers read the japanese scripts . the way it appears  it seems that they read and see something that says insert empty moral here  in big bold faced letters . it definitely appears that way as they used the same wonderful dubbing methods they used on msb  extreme sarcasm there  and created this crap .  br    br   possible spoilers from here on  br    br   well  i guess i should first talk about pikachu  s rescue adventure . my first gripe with this came with no narration . i guess they got enough bad comments on the pokdex narration that plagued pikachu  s vacation  and  instead of going with a caring  gentle woman  s voice as appeared in pikachu no natsu yasumi and pikachu tankentai  they just cut the narration all together . this wouldn  t have been a problem  except for one thing . did anyone really understand why the exeggcute didn  t let togepi go until the end  possibly the fans  but i  m sure not the parents . then  there  s the theme song . i couldn  t help but roll my eyes at this one . the japanese theme song was tankentai wo tsukurou  and was sung by japanese children . it was fun and enjoyable . this one nauseating . now  one of my favorite parts of the short was the dancing kireihana . nice music  fun to watch . that  s changed with the bellossom . the music sucked for one  but on top of that  they had all the pokmon talk during the music  which turned out to be jumpy  annoying  and just unnecessary . oh  and then there  s the poliwhirl who thinks he  s a poliwrath . you  d think that guys that work with these characters constantly would at least learn what they are . basically  not much could save this little ill fated dub  which is very unfortunate considering its potential . but  i haven  t touched on the worst of it yet .  br    br   you  d think that the warning signs would  ve been apparent to me when i received my issue of nintendo power . for some unfathomable reason  i had been placing some faith in  kids and the wb . my thoughts were well  they screwed up on the first movie  but the second is different as far as the theme goes  so they should do well .  that in mind  i just didn  t pay attention to the warning signs i encountered in the theaters when the trailers said  you will believe that one person can make all the difference .  with the way they said that at every turn  i was hoping that this would not turn into a moral fest like msb did at the end of the english version . then comes nintendo power  in which i see all my fears realized in the words the main feature  the power of one .  at that point  i became a bit more uneasy . the power of one    not a good sign . however  i still kept some of my false faith . big mistake .  br    br   sitting in the theater  i was literally getting stomach cramps watching another movie which i loved in japanese being turned into complete and utter junk . i hear comments that say it was better because the moral was more subtle . i can see a point in that since they didn  t pander this thing  repeating it over and over like in msb . however  it did more damage than anything else in this movie . first of all  the legend that was read throughout was changed a bit to read the world turns to ash .  ah hah . so  ash is the chosen one  whatever . in the japanese version  the inhabitants of arshia needed a pokmon trainer to carry out their traditional ceremony . this time  he  s the chosen one . a greater way that this did damage was to lugia . lugia was one of the coolest characters in a pokmon movie . . . . when the movie was about lugia . in this one  lugia is forced to take a back seat to ash . in the scene where they  re flying back to the main island  lugia and ash are discussing the conditions of lugia  s existence  not that ash is going to make all the difference . overall in this category  ash wasn  t really the one person  that would make the difference  since he was helped by many along the way .  br    br   a lot of the other stuff is kind of nit picking . furura  s flute song wasn  t nearly as sweet and enjoyable as the japanese one . jirarudan  s speech to them saying his collection started with a mew card   ugh . even worse  misty  s outrage originally concerned the way moltres and zapdos were being held . why didn  t you put them in pokballs when you caught them  this is like caging them to be displayed .  much different from whining about him thinking pokmon are things to be collected like stamps . if there were any real redeeming values in this  they came from team rocket . some pretty funny lines . not really to make me laugh out loud  but more to make me giggle and slightly ease the pains in my stomach . well  that was officially the last american pokmon movie i  m going to see . i  ve imported the third one and find it very enjoyable . i would rather not see another japanese movie be ruined in the same fashion as the first two . i  ll be importing the fourth one as well . forget you  kids wb and  kids . you have forsaken me for the last time .  ,0
the prerequisite for making such a film is a complete ignorance of nietzche  s work and personality  psychoanalytical techniques and vienna  s history . take a well  know genius you have not read  describe him as demented  include crazy physicians to cure him  a couple of somewhat good looking women  have his role played by an actor with an enormous mustache  have every character speak with the strongest accent  show ridiculous dreams  include another prestigious figure who has nothing to do with the first one  freud   mention a few words used in the genius  works  overdo everything you can  particularly music  and you are done . audience  please stay away .  ,0
this may be the worst film adaptation of a broadway musical ever . even the music has been destroyed . attenborough knows nothing about theater  almost every shot and moment ring false . i will say  though  that it is almost bad enough to be funny .  br    br   the hairstyles are remarkably dated . i can not for the life of me understand what is meant  conceptually  by opening the film with an exterior of the theater where  a chorus line  is playing . are we to think that these people are auditioning for  a chorus line   which contains the stories about the people who are auditioning  oh no  the show is collapsing on itself .  br    br   i saw the original production  and have listened to the album hundreds of times . why  oh  why  did they do this   ,0
i originally came across linda feferman  s seven minutes in heaven when i was   and worked at a video store and i loved it . i recently watched the movie again and have realized that it is a lost treasure . the movie stars jennifer connelly  almost twenty years before she would go on to win an oscar for beautiful mind  as natalie becker . byron thames plays her best friend in the world  jeff moran . the film is definitely a milder  cuter and softer version of the pretty in pink  s and some kind of wonderful  s of the      s  which is exactly why it is so good . it  s honest  not forced like those films  and parents will enjoy watching this movie with there kids .  br    br   when natalie  s dad leave home on a business trip  jeff convinces her that he should move in because his home life sucks . with support from natalie  s friend  polly  played exquisitely by maddie corman  she lets him . but this movie isn  t about putting kids in situations and seeing what they can get away with . the three leads are so natural and the script  surprisingly so honest  that what comes through best in their performances is heart breaking . these characters really do care about each other . it  s a great film to show to kids who are reaching pre  teen adolescence .  br    br    ,1
absolutely one of the worst movies i have ever seen  the acting  the dialog  the manuscript  the sound  the lighting  the plot line . i actually can  t say anything positive about this  although i enjoy swedish movies . the fighting scenes are so ridiculous that it  s impossible to take it seriously . and when the lead character just happens to loose his shirt  while dodging bullets in a strip bar  i  m not sure if it  s supposed to be a joke  or if someone really thinks these are ingredients in a good film   regina lund is the only half descent actor  but she disappears in a flood of laughable pronunciations and unbelievable reactions . it leaves you horrified that someone actually spent time and money on something like this . . .  ,0
yep . . this is definatly up there with some of the worst of the mstifyed movies  but i have definately seen worse . think gremlins rated r . well anyway  i met rick sloane at some sci  fi convention  that amazingly  he was lecturing at  it was one of those really low budget conventions  where everything goes  an everyone brought in something  if you want to see crap  you should have of seen what some friends and i brought in  .  br    br   he seemed like a very nice guy  he was very cool about my questions and comments on hobgoblins  and he even told me not to take it seriously  and said he loved the mst  k version   br    br   all in all  rick sloane knew what he was doing . and i think was meant to bad like mars attacks . so i guess i  m standing up for this movie and giving it a   and betraying all my fellow msties . sorry guys .  ,0
this movie is utterly hilarious . its cast clicks immediately with frame one and takes us on a wonderful ride through spoofing gangster films . the conflict of brother vs . brother appears when johnny  s brother becomes a do  gooder d . a . however  the best character is johnny  s crimelord rival  the overly accented moroni . as johnny says  that man should be arrested for butchering the english language .   br    br   check it out on video . it  s worth a look .  ,1

it  s a colorful slasher movie . that  s about it .  br    br   it has the mystery element that scream made so popular in slasher movies  but i never care for such things . figuring out who  s the bad guy is not that interesting considering the clues are all misleading anyway .  br    br   the death scenes were inventive and gorey  bringing back memories of    s horror movies like friday the   th .  br    br   another nice thing about this movie is that it  s hard to pinpoint the surviving girl  unlike in scream and ikwydls where it was obvious .  br    br   people who don  t like slasher movies won  t like this movie . as simple as that . i truly enjoyed it and i plan to watch it again while waiting for more of the same .  br    br     mb  ,1
i wondered why i didn  t like peggy sue got married more than i did  when it first came out in      with all the hype . somehow i found nic cage  s character off  putting . way off  putting . then the plot didn  t seem to make sense . then by the end of the credits  the question came to mind what point was this movie making  what was it saying  the answer  unfortunately  was not much  if anything . i really don  t think this movie aimed at making a statement unless it was  your life is your life  you  re gonna make the same mistakes no matter what  so keep your eye upon the doughnut  and not the hole  . not a very profound statement  and i  m sorry  not profoundly made in this movie . the writing simply isn  t that good . the direction is uneven  and is strangely overblown at times . kathleen turner was the best  and in my opinion  only worthwhile thing in this movie  and performed something of a miracle creating a whole character despite bizarre  unexplained circumstances  with a script that had no apparent statement to make .  br    br   she also finally cleared up the mystery for me of the main reason i didn  t enjoy this movie more . she states in her autobiography that cage made a point of fighting his uncle coppola  s direction every step of the way  doing it  his own way   not a good idea for a new actor   and putting on a goofy voice she called  stupid  . his voice was annoying  abrasive and unnatural  and his character was obnoxious and overbearing as a young guy . i understand what he was attempting to do play a young  guy  hot shot  who is not as hot as he thinks he is  setting up his own karma for future failure . but he goes overboard  the way he does it is abrasive  not effective  and if he had listened to his uncle instead of  fighting the man   we would have had a more enjoyable film . cage slips a little with his obnoxious voice stylings in the movie and occasionally sounds like a real person  and those scenes are more watchable than others . but if i had to watch the movie through in its entirety  i would find myself wanting to pay someone in l . a . to pour a bucket of water over his head during some of his more affected  put  on  scenes .  br    br   the movie doesn  t aim for a statement  doesn  t make a point  is great to look at except when cage is doing a demented elvis impression  but without the voice   and is  ultimately  confusing and a waste of time . given all this  kathleen turner surely deserved an oscar in this flailing mess of a movie . i can  t recommend anyone spending two hours watching this  unless you like turner and have a remote to pick out all her scenes . believe me  you will miss nothing plotwise by skipping the other scenes  and it will make just as much sense .  br    br   kathleen turner is getting a lot of flak from critics regarding her cage comments  which proves that she  s strong enough to be honest  and to hell with other people  s comments . you go  turner  i  m not particularly a fan of this actress any more than i am of any other first  rate actor or actress  but her candor is refreshing . cage  s acting can be good to annoying  and here it doesn  t work . at least  in this film  now we know why .  ,0
this is the worst film i have ever seen . i was watching this film with some friends and after   minutes we had enough . the plot was bad and there wasn  t a single likeable character . i could get more entertainment watching static . i gave this movie a  only because the scale didn  t go into negative numbers . avoid this movie at all costs .  ,0
overall the film is ok . i think it  s better than sepet and much better than gubra in term of its story  its sentimental value .  br    br   there are a few scenes that makes me touched . yes i agree that the boy  mukhsin  did his acting very good . brilliant . i can say that his acting is almost natural .  br    br   however  the song  ne me quitte pas  by nina simone really   menaikkan  my  bulu   roma   .  br    br   i love the song . both the song .  ne me quitte pas  and  hujan  . i just downloaded the song . beautiful .  br    br   and salute to yasmin . the movie  s ending credit makes me touched again . we can see how yasmin really appreciated her parents in an unique way .  br    br   i think the movie deserves that grand prix of international jury at berlin film festival .  br    br   i give  .  out of  o stars .  ,1
this is a must see for independant movie fans  but it also holds up well against mainstream movies . i think we have the makings of the next woody allen or  br    br   trentin tarrentino here .  br    br   the budget is painfully low . no special effects whatsoever  and they seemingly used ambient lighting  shot in digital video .   and yet this movie grabs hold of you and never lets go . the screenplay is somewhat bizarre  yet the actors and director pull it off with complete realism . it has humor  it has intrigue  and it has pathos  and it all works together .  br    br   no point in describing the details . if you want to see an independant  br    br   masterpiece  a virtual lesson in how to make a low budget flick that really works  see this one .  br    br    oh yeah  it  s also really entertaining .  br    br    ,1
this may have been based on historical events  and we know that the makers of this tv docu  drama took liberties to make it more dramatic  i can live with that  but it was just so badly done  i was amazed in the event of an unfolding mid  air crisis how calm everyone seemed  surely someone would have panicked  and what a smooth flight  no passenger discomfort apparent  come on  not sure about the regulations  nowadays some of the airline security stuff seems ott nonsense  but why take your shoes off before the emergency landing  common sense tells me this is not a good idea  the shots of this massive airliner coming down on this remote airstrip were unconvincing and fake . in reality it would have been an awesome sight viewed from the ground nearby  in this movie it was out of proportion and looked like the model it probably was . escape slides appeared at the front and mid emergency doors  yet nobody appeared to exit from the front  even though the drop was much less . the captain went back into the plane after the landing  why  this was never explained . we know the emergency landing was due to being out of fuel  but even so there must have been some fuel sloshing around at the bottom of the tanks  and the risk of explosion must have been a very real danger  yet the evacuation seemed almost leisurely  and everyone stands around at the foot of the escape slides instead of getting as far away as possible  as i am sure i would have done . there were just too many inconsistencies  errors and faked action in this . i would have preferred to have seen a representation of the drama in real time  and with realistic motion of the plane portrayed . it had the potential to be quite thrilling  but doubtless due to the budget restrictions failed  and made one feel that a plane losing all engines was no big deal really  and you would safely glide down to a bit of a bumpy landing  but no real danger   the reality of course being somewhat different   ,0
this was so lame that i turned the dvd off . . . maybe halfway through . it was so weak  i couldn  t even pay full enough attention to tell you how far in i made it . though i really wanted to believe that the depiction of the young carlito would be somewhat different  i just couldn  t buy it . i don  t really blame the actors  because i think it was the script that may have fallen flat . i did find myself laughing a few times  but i don  t think those lines were intended to be funny .  br    br   it  s only saving grace is that i bought it in a  dvd set and i would have paid the price i did for the original alone . this is one of those cases when they should have let the classic stand alone .  ,0
well this movie actually made me feel so strongly that i signed up for an imdb account just to warn people . it is patently awful   nothing makes sense in this movie . there is way too many subplots for a start . josh hartnett  s character is an aspiring actor and yoga instructor as well as a cop who seems to be living way beyond his means and only teaches yoga to hot girls  some of whom wait naked in his jacuzzi for when he comes back from work  . add to that the fact that his dad was killed by a crooked cop who just so happens to be in on the current crime being investigated by the hapless duo . harrison ford  s character is trying to sell real estate on the side and is sleeping with the internal affairs investigator  s ex  wife who happens to run a psychic radio show which ford  s character calls from time to time . nonsense    br    br   i can  t remember the characters names  that  s how forgettable this is  so i  ll refer to them as ford and hartnett .  br    br   then there  s the dialogue which is brutal . i mean cringe  inducing stuff here . throw in every clich in the book  having a heart  to  heart in a dark bar during the day over a drink where the bartender knows his name the duo being investigated by internal affairs  why     hartnett confronting his dad  s killer  and you  ve got one hell of a mess .  br    br   as i mentioned the plot is preposterous and continuity is non  existent   when ford  s car is being repossessed  how the hell did the repo guys know where it would be parked  were they following him     when hartnett goes to the morgue and it just so happens that the only clue from the crime scene  an earring  is replicated on of the charred bodies there  that was lucky     when the two are arrested and taken in for questioning  ford keeps answering his phone and hartnett  centers himself  with a yoga pose on the table . instead of taking the phone from ford the ia guy waits for it to ring each time and then tries to grab it off the table before ford does . meanwhile the female ia officer in with hartnett is rubbing herself all over him . then  inexplicably  the two are released without answering any questions .   during the car chase hartnett  s car is crashing and smashing its way around hollywood but then suddenly the car is perfect again . not a scratch    when ford chases the bad guy into the building and he gets in the elevator how the hell does he know which floor the bad guy got off at     when the two are chasing the bad guy around in hartnett  s car  ford is trying to close a real estate deal . come on    the bad guy is the most unconvincing record exec ever . his motivation for killing an aspiring group of rappers on his label  they might leave his label and it  s a warning to keep his other groups loyal . but hang on  how is he ever going to sign anyone new with that business plan     why is the ia guy who is investigating ford arrested in the end  there is no explication     and hartnett gets to use his  acting  to capture the bad guy in the end .  br    br   i could go on  i really could . anyone who is looking deeper into this movie than a straight up action comedy needs their head examined because that  s all it is . there  s nothing else to it  it  s not supposed to be satirical or ironic . it  s just crap .  ,0
the idea is nice . bringing so many stars in one movie is great . but . . . . too many stories  too short and lacking really any sense . no connection between the scenes . there were some    brilliant stories . . . but these were out of   . the frame reminded me of  all the invisible children   a movie which i liked a lot . compared to it  however   paris je t  aime  lacks the intriguing short story  which develops  starts and has its end . and it lacks the topic connecting all those  children . i do not find paris enough of a topic to connect   short sketches together . perhaps for people who know paris it is interesting . otherwise  i wouldn  t recommend it . . .  ,0
as i was watching this movie i was thinking  ok it  ll get good any moment . . . i was wrong . the real best part of this movie was when it was over . a complete waste of   minutes . all seriousness aside the best part was when the wendigo finally showed up which was at the end and you couldn  t really even see him that good . and the tail end was really kind of dumb as well . there was too many sections in the movie where you thought something was going to happen but was a let down . the worse part is there was more talk of the wendigo then there was wendigo . for the creature to be so bad  you definitely couldn  t tell it by this movie .  ,0
i just rented this movie to see dolph lundgren  whom i hadn  t seen in any movies since rocky iv . unfortunately this movie was a big disappointment . the acting of all the parties was bad except for mr . lundgren  who was okay  ish . kata dob was something nice to look at despite her ridiculous outfit and make  up .  br    br   the plot is not at all clever  it  s something that  s been repeated a million times in different movies . the crooks were utterly stereotypical  and lundgren  s character hadn  t any depth in it . i didn  t really expect a movie masterpiece  but unfortunately this is not even decent action . every turn in the plot is extremely predictable and the unbelievable amount of over  the  top unrealism and comic  book like characters started to annoy me strongly pretty soon .  br    br   i would recommend this to young kids wanting some comic  like action  but only if nothing else is available .  br    br       .  i guess the current average vote of  .  with  votes must have been influenced by somebody involved in making this movie   ,0
hm . while an enjoyable movie to poke plot holes  point out atrocious acting  primitive  at best  special effects  all of which have caused me to view this movie three times over the past six years   severed ranks among the worst i  ve ever seen . i  m never sure who the protagonists are  all i know is that the killer uses a portable guillotine  as seen in the dance floor murder scene . all in all  i don  t really like the movie  because only the first   minutes are enjoyable  the rest is a mishmash of confusing dialog and imagery that fail to progress the story to a logical conclusion  which i can  t remember anyway  .  ,0
guy is a loser . can  t get girls  needs to build up  is picked on by stronger more successful guys  etc . seen it  saw it  moved on . i  d have to say that rob needs to move past the adam sandler part of his life . and get out of the adam sandler plots . there are two funny parts in the whole movie . i couldn  t even finish the last  minutes . i was getting bored .  the animal  is an alright film . i do usually enjoy adam sandler films that have the same plot . but this was trying too hard to impress . the jokes are very old . so  trust me . this is not a film that most people could really get into . but some did  so i  ll be nice .  br    br        ,0
david aames is a rich good  looking guy who lives in new york city . when his  sleeping partner  julie gianni gets very jealous after david falls for spanish beauty sofia  she gets david into her car and tells him that he  s the only guy she loves and wants to be with  but seeing as he  s in love with sofia  she decides to commit suicide with david in the car with her  by driving off a bridge . david survives the crash  but is left with a disfigured face . he is then charged with the murder of julie . the thing is  david doesn  t know what  s real and what  s not as he keeps having these strange dreams  most of which are actually nightmares .  and flashbacks  some of which just don  t make sense to him . everything will soon come back to him though as he  s begins to find out the truth .  br    br   well  there  s an all star cast here  including tom cruise  penlope cruz  cameron diaz  kurt russell  jason lee and noah taylor who all give good performances in the movie . in the movie they all put off different things about there characters  like happiness  sadness  angry  etc . really well . there  s also a cameo in the movie from the brilliant  steven spielberg .  br    br   vanilla sky is a well made  different  interesting and original movie which will leave you talking about it a lot after it  s finished . it  s not just a thriller  but it  s a real psychological thriller . the trailer for the movie is really good  but the movie is so different from what it might be made out to be . it  s been directed very well and there were a couple of really great scenes here too . all in all  an enjoyable movie which should be really be paid attention too . they are sure making a lot of  are they dead  if not who is dead  movies recently .  ,1
i completely agree with jamrom  . . this was the single most horrible movie i have ever seen . . holy crap it was terrible . . i was warned not to see it . . and foolishly i watched it anyway . . about   minutes into the painful experience i completely gave up on watching the atrocity . . but sat through until the end . . just to see if i could . . well i did and now i wish i had not . . it was disgusting . . nothing happened and the ending was all preachy . . no movie that bad has the right to survive . . i implore all of you to spare yourself the terror of fatty drives the bus . . if only i had heeded the same warning . . please save yourself from this movie . . i have a feeling those who rated it highly were involved in the making of the movie . . and should all be wiped off the face of the planet . .  ,0
i can only believe that garson kanin must have been two people . the one who wrote the brilliant  a double life  and the funny  born yesterday  and co  wrote such excellent screenplays as  adam  s rib  and  pat and mike  with his wife ruth gordon and then the one who wrote and  or directed such tiresome  sad drivel as  bachelor mother    some kind of a nut   and this . the cast tries  but the script is so tired and clichd that even the efforts of the always wonderful brenda vaccaro are defeated . the script sinks to it  s nadir in the truly offensive sequence in which janssen  s character tests drivas  s character to make sure he  s not gay . an ugly sequence  but sadly one which could easily play in a film today .  ethnic  jokes are now totally verboten  but  fag  jokes are still  good  clean  family fun  .  ,0
i  m a fan of matthew modine  but this film   which i stumbled upon on cable   is absolutely witless . i see that the screenwriter and director were one and the same  so there was no one around to check her worst instincts . there are no surprises  no original lines  and no original characters . the goldfish was basically the most sympathetic character . what a waste of all this acting talent . given how expensive it is to film in new york these days  i have to wonder how this got made in the first place . and if you  re wondering why i watched it at all  it came on after a film that i like on cable and i left it on while i worked at the computer . it  s not a very demanding picture   ,0
domestic import was a great movie . i laughed the whole time . it was funny on so many levels from the crazy outfits to the hilarious situations . the acting was great . alla korot  larry dorf  howard hesseman  and all the others did an awesome job . because it is an independent film written by a first  time writer  it doesn  t have the clichs that are expected of other comedies  which was such a relief . it was a unique and interesting and you fall in love with the characters and the heart  warming story . i heard it was based on a true story  if so  then that is hilarious  and amazing   . i highly recommend this movie .  ,1
refreshing lost  gem  featuring effective dialog combined with excellent acting to establish the characters and involve you enough to care what happens to them . the douglas and widmark characters are realistic heroes . palance is his usual evil presence . widmark win the fisticuffs fight scene  a car chase of less than   seconds with a logical  end  and a lengthy chase on foot that shames the overdone chase sequences of contemporary hollywood . you know how it will likely end  but the suspense and interest are sustained throughout . the end of the chase is one of the most realistic you will ever see . the film seems to slow a little past the middle  but stay with it for the rewarding conclusion .  ,1
winchester   gets credit from many critics for bringing back the western after wwii . director anthony mann must get a lot of credit for his excellent direction . jimmy stewart does an excellent job  but i think stephen mcnalley and john mcintire steal the movie with their portrayal of two bad guys involved in a high stakes poker game with the treasured winchester   going to the winner . this is a good script with several stories going on at the same time . look for the first appearance of rock hudson as young bull . thank god  with in a few years  we would begin to let indians play themselves in western films . the film is in black and white and was shot in tucson arizona . i would not put winchester   in the category of stagecoach  high noon or shane  but it gets an above average recommendation from me .  br    br   .  ,1
i don  t remember ever seeing this one before tonight  probably the title sounded so ordinary it kept passing me by . but it is a well crafted b western  with an interestingly brooding storyline complimented by acting veering from the good to corny .  br    br   robert mitchum slopes into wide open town looking for his wife and news of their daughter  and stays for a time as town  tamer . as usual the good business folk have mixed emotions  they want to get rid of the baddies but like the business they bring . it still applies relax drink and gambling laws and encourage the industries but pretend to deplore the seedy effects it can have on ordinary people . what  s fascinating about this film is mitchum  s cynically intense portrayal in going about cleaning the town of baddies  and the townsfolk  s acceptance that his violent methods were the only ones . favourite bit the sudden demise of  of the baddies in the red dog saloon . the firing of the main saloon bordered on nasty  but it was an effective way to combat the spread of poison .  br    br   overall a very good film with its only fault tending to be a little hokeyness  not so good for do  gooders who would probably prefer a lifetime of negotiation with evil rather than end it .  ,1
we loved the movie . i am a mother to two little men . i love having a movie i can watch with them where men have integrity and character . moveis where money is not the most important thing . and family  s are forever and love means more then words .  br    br   i do wish we saw more of the davis family . but over all i loved it left me with the same feeling the others did  please don  t be over  . we both wish actors would not change . the new actors were good replacement tho .  br    br   my  year old son loved this movie too . asked me to go buy them all . he is a movie critic so for him to say this tells me something . family should all see this move buy it for friends . help bring back a time of values . we will be reading the books now that we are hooked . really hope to see more . be blessed happy moving  ,1
a remake of the superb     movie of the stage play  nicely casting caine as the nemesis of his character from the first movie . but doing nothing else nicely at all .  br    br   a under  parr performance from the actors  law and caine  diluted further by weak self  indulgent direction .  br    br   the warmth of the setting in the original is forsaken for a super  modern homesetting . the subtle interplay between oliver and caine which made the first movie so watchable  is replaced with a horrid  brash arrogance that instantly breeds disdain in the viewer . but this is not the clever  to  ing and froing of liking one then the other character the original fostered so well  this is an obvious ott character assassination of both character from the word go .  br    br   this version of sleuth is not really worth seeing  watch the original film and be dazzled from the opening act .  ,0
i saw this movie once a long time ago  and i have no desire to ever see it again .  br    br   this movie is about preston waters  a hard  lucked preteen  who always seems to be overlooked by his family and who always seems to be short on cash . all this changes when a bank robber runs over preston  s bike and passes him a blank check as compensation . preston uses the check to withdraw   million from the bank  ironically  the money belongs to the bank robber who gave him the check  . preston then buys a mansion and says that he  s working as the assistant of a mysterious and wealthy backer named mr . macintosh  named after his computer  . after that  he just goes crazy with the money .  br    br   on paper  this sounds like a great idea . however  on screen  it is one of the emptiest movies i  ve ever seen . for one thing  it  s too unbelievable . i know some parts of the movie were meant to be incredible  but i draw the line at a twelve  year  old boy going out with a thirty  year  old woman  and being put in charge of a imaginary person  s small fortune . also  this was a shallow movie with weak acting  a predictable plot line and characters who are less than memorable . the characters were either cheesy  over the top  annoying  or underdeveloped . but  juice  was a funny character .  br    br   if you  re looking for a good movie to watch with your family  skip this one .  ,0
i have watched quite a few cold case episodes over the years  beginning with season  episodes back in          . and while most have been good  this particular episode was not only the best of the best  but has few rivals in the emmy categories . though some may not agree with the story content  i . e . the male  to  male romantic relationship   i doubt that anyone could watch this without being deeply moved within their spirit .  br    br   the story is essentially about a case that was reopened  based on the testimony from a dying drug dealer . the two central actors are two police officers in the      s named sean coop  aka  the cold case victim who goes by his last name  coop  and his partner  jimmy bruno .  br    br   in the story  coop is single  a vietnam war vet  with a deeply troubled past . jimmy  however  is married  with children no less . both are partners on the police force and form not only a friendship  but a secret romantic relationship that they both must hide from a deeply and obviously homophobic culture prevalent at that time .  br    br   the flashback scenes of their lives are mostly in black and white  with bits of color now and then sprinkled throughout . examples include their red squad car  the yellow curtains gently blowing by the window in jimmy  s bedroom  where jimmy  s wife watched coop and jimmy drink  fight  and then kiss each other while being in an alcohol  induced state . i found it interesting that only selected items were colored in the flashback scenes  with everything else in black and white . i still have not figured out the color scheme and rationale .  br    br   the clearly homophobic tension between fellow patrol officers and the two central actors only heightens the intensity of the episode . one key emotional scene was when coop was confronted by his father after the baptism of jimmy  s baby . in this scene  coop  s father  sarge  who was a respected fellow officer on the force  confronts coop about the rumors surrounding coop  s relationship with jimmy . one can feel sorry for coop  at this point  as the shame and disgrace of coop  s father was heaped upon coop   you are not going to disgrace our family . . . and you  re not my son  either .   clearly indicative of the hostile views of same  sex relationships of that era .  br    br   additional tension can also be seen in the police locker room where coop and another officer go at it after coop and jimmy are labeled  batman and robin homos  .  br    br   as for the relationship between coop and jimmy  it  s obvious that coop wanted more of jimmy in his life . once can see the tension in jimmy  s face as he must choose between his commitment to his wife and kids  his church  and yet his undying devotion to coop .  br    br   in the end  jimmy walks away from coop  realizing that he cannot have both coop and his family at the same time . sadly  coop is killed  perhaps because of his relationship with jimmy  but coop may also have been killed for his knowledge of drug money and police corruption that reached higher up in the force .  br    br   the most moving scene in the whole episode was when coop  as he sat dying from gunshot wounds in his squad car  quietly spoke his last words over his police radio to his partner  jimmy . . . we were the lucky ones . don  t forget that .   br    br   the soundtrack selection was outstanding throughout the episode . i enjoyed the final scene with the actor chad everett  playing the still grieving jimmy  only much older by now  and clearly still missing his former partner  coop .  br    br   i highly recommend this episode and consider it the best . it is without a doubt the most well  written  well  acted  and well done of all cold case episodes that i  ve ever seen .  ,1
no awards show can please all the people . clearly if your favorite movies didn  t win  you will say the show wasn  t very good . that  s understandable .  br    br   however  the   th annual academy awards will be remembered for one magical moment of hollywood history  br    br   woody allen  s first appearance ever at the academy awards .  br    br   allen has often shunned the awards as being self  aggrandizing and pointless  and has never attended   even though he has won several of the coveted awards .  br    br   when the   th academy awards were held  the nation was still mourning the loss of life in the collapse of the world trade centers in new york . when it came time to pay tribute to the city of new york  they decided to show a video of the great movie moments form the city of cities . then the announcer simply said  br    br    ladies and gentleman  oscar award winning director woody allen .   br    br   the place erupted in an extremely long standing ovation . the entertainment industry finally got to give their applause to the man from new york who usually avoids the hollywood scene . as the applause died down  woody applied some of his legendary wit to the situation .  br    br   some highlights  br    br    thank you very much  that makes up for the strip search .   br    br    i thought they wanted their oscars back   he joked .  i panicked because the pawn shop has been out of business for ages and i had no way of retrieving anything .   br    br    but that wasn  t it . i couldn  t work it out because my movie wasn  t nominated for anything this year . then it hit me  maybe they were calling to apologise .   br    br   allen also disclosed why he had overlooked his lifelong oscar  aversion for this one special night .  br    br    for new york city  i  d do anything . so i got my tux on and came down here   said allen .  br    br    it  s a great  great movie town . it  s been a great  moving and exciting backdrop for movies and it remains a great  great city .   br    br    ,1
new york city houses one man above all others  the possibly immortal dr . anton mordrid . mordrid is the sworn protector of humanity  using his magical powers to keep his brother and rival  kabal  chained up so that he may not enslave the human race . well  wouldn  t you know it  a prophesy comes true and kabal breaks free  and begins collecting elements  including platinum and uranium  for his alchemy experiments . with the help of a police woman named sam  can mordrid defeat his evil brother   dr . mordrid  comes to me courtesy of charles band in the full moon archive collection . i had not heard of it  which is a bit odd given that i  m a big fan of jeffrey combs  mordrid  and the film isn  t that old . but now it  s mine and i can enjoy it again and again . the film certainly is fun in the classic full moon style . richard band provides the music  which doesn  t differ much from all his other scores  and brian thompson plays the evil kabal . we even have animated dinosaur bones  what more do you want  of course  the cheese factor is high . i felt much of the film was a rip  off of the dr . strange comics . and the blue pantsuit was silly . and plot holes are everywhere  i could list at least five  but why bother  . and why does the ancient symbol of mordrid and kabal look suspiciously like a hammer and sickle  combs has never been a strong actor  so he fits right in with the cheese . these aren  t complaints . full moon fans have come to expect these things and devour them like crack  laced grape nuts . i  m guilty . . . i loved this film .  br    br   if you  re not a full moon fan  or a jeffrey combs fan . . . you may want to look elsewhere . but if you like the early     s style of movie  making and haircuts  you  ll eat this up . stallone and schwarzenegger fans might like seeing brian thompson as a villain  looking as goony as ever and not being able to enunciate english beyond a third grade level . i did . i wish there was a  mordrid ii   but the company that makes a sequel to practically everything  is  gingerdead man   really necessary   passed on this one .  ,1
i caught this movie on fx last night  and as i was sitting there watching it  it occurred to me that it could quite possibly be the worst movie ever . bad acting  bad cinematography  bad sound  totally unbelievable fight sequences  stupid characters . all these made it up to be the most laughably bad movie i  ve ever seen . it was so bad  i was enthralled by it  s sheer lack of anything semi  competent that i had to keep watching . . . and they made a sequel   ,0
elephants dream was supposed to be the flagship project of the open source community . and while it was a very interesting idea in concept  in reality it has failed miserably .  br    br   the film is beautifully rendered  which is probably the only redeeming factor . a huge problem with them  however  is the vast overruse of light bloom . it  s horrible  although i guess it helps give the film a dreamlike quality .  br    br   one thing to note is the terrible voice acting . while proog  s voice actor is at least semi  competent  emo  s voice actor is horrible . i guess when you have a budget that basically amounts to zero  you can  t afford to hire real voice actors . to me it seems like they hired one of the animators to do his voice .  br    br   as a whole  the movie doesn  t really go anywhere . to me it seems like it  s more of a  look what we can do  kind of movie instead of a real film . the plot goes nowhere and fails at really showing any interesting point . the whole movie feels like it was made as an excuse to make interesting looking areas .  br    br   overall  it may be worth a quick download from the official site  but don  t expect anything except pretty graphics .  ,0
a couple of days after writing about how garbage like mad cows and this filthy earth receive money while ange  duncan and theo are totally ignored i had to sit through yet another british movie  that had me scratching my head as to why it received a single penny . some people may claim that because dead babies is based upon a highly regarded novel it has an in built market but both this filthy earth and mad cows were also adapted from novels and they were an ordeal to sit through as well  br    br   i had read the synopsis of the plot where a bunch of high class wasters go to a remote mansion where they  re stalked by an internet cult but to be honest this isn  t really how the story unravels and anyone expecting friday the   th meets the shining is going to be bitterly disappointed since       of the running time is taken up with said characters taking drugs and discussing sex . and what hateful characters they are too . not one of them is likable in any way and within minutes you  ll be getting nostalgic for stalin  mao and pol pot hoping that next time someone embarks on communist democide they  ll be successful in creating an egalitarian utopia . anything that will signal the end of such decadent bourgeois meaningless that the hateful characters in this movie embark upon can only be welcomed  br    br   not content with giving us a movie where the plot is meandering and where the audience fail to connect with the characters the director continues to spoil things further by getting all clever and arty . no doubt that is to impress us so we will fall upon our knees and cry  oh my god  what a wonderful director the way he bamboozles us with his highly artistic technique and only a worthless pleb will fail to appreciate what a god given talent this man is  . i  m sure the vast majority of people either screamed  how come my projects got turned down while crap like this didn  t   or  wtf was the last half hour of this piece of crap all about   you might defend the movie by saying the original source novel was unfilmable and this makes the film unwatchable . i will agree that this movie is unwatchable  br    br    i know the imdb classes this as an american movie but the style and faults with dead babies is uniquely british . americans might think they  ve got things tough with bush but we  ve got tony blair  not to mention dead babies  mad cows and this filthy earth . no wonder everyone is ashamed to be british in the   st century  ,0
one is tempted to define the genre of gert de graaff  s movie as event of the thought  following the example of merab mamardashvili . the nominal storyline is a certain bart klever  s torturous quest for that ephemeral substance which constitutes the essence of personality . the script for his new movie is taking shape simultaneously on his computer and in his own imagination . this film  monologue originated as a response to fellini  s     and cost gert de graaff   years of work . excitedly playing with real and fictional characters as well as with the audience  it reveals the whimsical interconnection of the real and imaginary  the paradoxical co  existence in two different galaxies that of guttenberg and that of maclhuen . for some time we are apt to side with the script writer  who believes that the cause of all misfortune is the damned stereotypes of mass mentality  man   catholic   window washer   . and together with him we fall into a trap when the author  creator is finally faced with the insoluble dilemma how can one eliminate from the future movie . bart klever  just five minutes before the finale thanks to the common petty reproaches of the wife of the creator  who is deeply immersed in work  we realize that together with the main character we have again been framed  . really  what is the price of the art for the sake of which it is acceptable to renounce one  s own name and the day  to  day care for the young daughter   br    br   so who is he  this bart klever  is he a brilliant prophet or someone possessed like frenhoffer from balzac  s masterpiece  just like the latter the script writer in the end erases from the computer memory everything has written   gert de graaff suggests that we answer this question ourselves .  br    br    ,1
made the unfortunate mistake of seeing this film in the edinburgh film festival . it was well shot from the outset  but that  s the last positive comment i have about the film . the acting was awful  i wonder if actual gogo girls were hired  but it was the plot that was truly laughable  in fact that it was laughable and not boring is the only reason i gave this     .  br    br    spoilers below  .  br    br   i just want to mention a few of the scenes that really got the audience laughing .  br    br   shoving the girl in the field who would have thought that a kid shoving another kid could be acted so badly . a real eye  opener .  br    br   the getting on the bus scene the girl is getting on the bus . but  according to the music  the world is ending .  br    br   the rolling under the clothes line wow  this one really demonstrates the plot writer  s skills . in the room  followed by raw meat and skill selling . why not just get her to perform all three  sins  at once  at least then the film might have been slightly shorter .  br    br   the running down the stairs of the mall watch as one of the girls takes to flight down the stairs pursued by a flesh eating dau  no wait . . she is just walking quickly trying not to break her nails .  br    br   the running covered in blood this is definitely my favourite scene  and a fitting end to the movie . a half marathon in red paint  completed by vaulting up stairs and over the bridge  only to be sent flying most unrealistically by a passing car . not only this  but this suicide is undertaken by the most self obsessed girl in the film  now that  s sticking to character for you .  br    br   i  d like to think that this film was created by a   year old and their mates . sadly  having met the director at the presentation  this is not the case .  br    br   but  if you  re in a sarcastic mood  and fancy a laugh with a few mates . . then still don  t even think about it .  ,0
a low budget effort from texas that  s at least filmed well  but that is little consolation . bad acting  or  should i say  bad over  acting  a pretty limp story line that  s nothing new  bad special effects  bad  bad  bad . seems like a bunch of young folks are putting together a haunted house for halloween  which is done every year  but this year things are different . has a long extended lesbian theme that is not only annoying but definitely fills out the empty spots  of which there are a lot . putrid  puerile  definitely avoidable  at all costs .  ,0
firstly  i have heard great things about this film  not least among the retro  vintage scene and the stockings lovers who absolutely love bettie page and it did not disappoint . shot in very clean black and white with colour added for key scenes  the film gives a documentary feel to the early life and career of bettie page .  br    br   there are many things i did not know about page . firstly  there was the gang rape  later on  there is her early attempts at developing an acting career and then glamour pictures  firstly with a camera club peopled with men who can  t get enough of her and later with the klaws  paula and irving  who despite their taking of bondage and fetish photos  come across as extremely pleasant and friendly people . if only modern pornography producers were like that  perhaps better porn would be a consequence  for the most part  the film is neither a diatribe against the evils of pornography but an attempt to show the kind of environment that existed in the     s for those producing fetish and nude pictures of women . this environment was extremely repressive  perhaps in a good way because it meant that there was none of the  saturation  effect that we have today  when it comes to pornography . it also appeared to be much less harsh . page comes across as someone who enjoys her work and doesn  t appear to be degraded by it . in many of her photos she is seen tied up and gagged  and trying to hold a conversation   brandishing a whip with a flourish  thus exciting the photographers taking her pictures and seen in  initiation style  girlie bondage movies which look quite tame compared with the hardcore stuff we have now .  br    br   page never became an actress and instead deserted pinup when she was in her thirties for  jesus christ  . her belief in god and jesus never goes away  even when bound and gagged she still insists that she has been given a  gift  by god to do  this thing  . seeing this film  i am more knowledgeable about page and in awe at her modesty  beliefs and demeanour . she is one of a kind  compared with the identi  kit clone blondes we have today and someone who can actually say  there is life after porn  .  ,1

sitting  typing nothing is the latest  what if   fest offered by vincenzio natali  and starring david hewlitt and andrew miller as two losers . one is having relationship problems  got canned from his job  because of relationship problems  and the police are out to get him  because of his job and his relationship problems  . the other guy is a agoraphobic who refuses to go outside his home  is met by a bothersome girl guide who calls on her mom to claim she was molested when he doesn  t buy cookies from him . oh yeah  the police are after him too  after the mom of the girl scout call them in to arrest him .  br    br   man  what a day .  br    br   what if you could make all of this disappear  that is the whole premise behind  nothing  . the two fools realize  the cops  the girl scout  the cars  the lawn  the road  everything disappear . there  s nothing but white space  this is an interesting concept i thought . i also looked at the time of this    minutes had gone in the movie  and i still had an hour left in the movie . could the  actors make this work and keep us entertained for   minutes  although the actors try    minutes is a long time and there is clearly dead air in places of this movie . but the two actors  whom are life  long friends with each other and the director  have such great repertoire with each other  that it was fun to watch for the dialogue and improve goofing around the two do . there are lots of supernatural elements  but it  s more of their response to these elements that ultimately make this film worth seeing .  ,1
i can  t quite say that  jerry springerringmaster  is the worst film i have ever seen . the film would be better off if it were  because at least the worst film i  ve ever seen   prom night ii  interested me enough for me to hate it . my only reaction after leaving the theatre happened when i looked up at the clock and discovered that only   minutes had passed . it had seemed much more like years . it is an endless repetition of poor people   or what jerry springer seems to believe poor people are   screwing each other  hitting each other  insulting each other  and then repeating the process with the same attention to duty the rest of us use when shampooing . the plot  which covers how a group of stupid people mangle their lives badly enough to provide grist for the jerry springer mill  advances solely because of the idiocy of the characters . this makes it impossible to care what happens to them . it never mattered to me whether they got on the show  or what they said  or who slept with whom . maybe i  m not supposed to care about them . maybe i  m supposed to look at them as some kind of comic type   to see their outrageous behavior as inherently funny . too bad it isn  t . the humor is not outrageous . it  s innocuous . it  s predictable . humor has to have something behind it  some kind of painful irony or life experience  in order to function . scatology is not wit . an example . a mother catches her daughter and her husband in bed . to take revenge she marches across the trailer park and gives oral sex to her daughter  s boyfriend . since i was over the shock of jerry springer  s show a long time ago  i had the same reaction i had to andrew dice clay  s obscene nursery rhymes not laughter  just yawning . lastly  i found springer  s pose as a populist tiresome and unconvincing . if he really were an advocate of the poor  he would bring on a single mom from bed  sty to talk about trying to raise her kids in new york city on        a year . or  failing that  he would at least give the participants of his shows a cut of his profits . jerry springer gets millions for his shows  his movie  his book and videos . his guests just get round trip air fare  hotel accommodations  and a chance to humiliate themselves . if he liked poor people so much  he  d give them at least some of the money they earn for him . it appears that springer wanted to make this movie to grab some legitimacy for himself . jeez  with all his fine work  you  d think he  d have earned our respect already . anyway  the film is weak and boring . it doesn  t even succeed at being offensive . if you want to have a better evening  videotape a bug zapper for a night and then watch that .  ,0
overlong drama that isn  t capable of making any real point . so she became an actress  so what  she learned to love  big deal . there is a certain eccentricity among the characters and in the dialog and situations  but the kind which is bad for the movie  causing it to often seem absurd .  br    br   summer phoenix  playing the lead  talks and behaves like a semi  retarded person  so there is no choice but to watch the movie as about a retarded girl that makes it in the world of theater  which was clearly not the intended point . we are told early on  in that  barry lyndon   like narration  that she learned to hide her emotions  which certainly explains her autistic stone  face  but the movie suffers for it . she basically walks around like a zombie  and her success as an actress isn  t quite credible given her lack of emotions . occasionally  the movie had that dull  sleepy feel of a dogma   movie . is it one  i wouldn  t be at all surprised .  br    br   summer phoenix is sister of joaquim phoenix and the late river phoenix . nepotism rarely works .  br    br   if you  d like to see my hollywood nepotism list  with over    pictures  entries  contact me by e  mail .  ,0
every time i see nicole i like her more . i love a movie like this . a woman you just won  t give up on  but she keeps breaking your heart . first movie i remember seeing like this was of human bondage  the kim novak  laurence harvey version . the beefs about the correctness of the russian spoken in this film are petty  it was good enough to fool me or anybody else who can  t speak russian  i  m sure . funny how people miss the point . the no  goodnik russian guys were well cast too . finally  i have to tip my hat to ben chaplin  as somebody else noted  he plays a sap with great dignity  and there was definitely some heat between him and nicole . to think  guys get paid for that  mind  blowing .  ,1
half the reviews were good so i took a chance for    . sure priscilla barnes had some sex talk but it wasn  t much . the whole plot later that she may be the other actress mother  the documentary maker falling for the young woman is stretching it . its not funny its not that raunchy its not much of anything but a waste of time . boogie nights was based on real people that were in the adult industry this is based on nothing that ever happened in the industry . it could have shocked with whats popular today in adult films mocking todays gonzo videos and that big orgy that they had  minutes to shoot what a joke a bigger orgy has been done bigger  better decades ago in the early     s .  ,0
the good i liked this movie because it was the first horror movie i  ve seen in a long time that actually scared me . the acting wasn  t too bad  and the  cupid  killer was believable and disturbing .  br    br   the bad the story line and plot of this movie is incredibly weak . there just wasn  t much to it . the ways the killer killed his victims was very horrifying and disgusting . i do not recommend this movie to anyone who can not handle gore .  br    br   overall a good scare  but a bad story .  br    br    out of   ,0
this was an excellent film . i don  t understand why so many people don  t like it . there was so much in it to connect with  so many beautiful images  and so much compassion in the things that weren  t said . i was thoroughly entertained  and was left with a feeling of joyous exuberance  just as i am when i finish most any tom robbins story . now i haven  t read this particular book of robbin  s  so i don  t now how this matched up  but i can  t imagine this movie could have been a very bad interpretation . the movie left a lot for you to define yourself  which is the best part of any tom robbins novel  dreaming up the details .  br    br   to all of you who said this was the worst movie ever  i pity what little must be left of the dimming light in your hearts . far from the worst ever this movie was glorious . long live the whooping crane .  ,1
star pickford and director tourneur   along with his two favorite cameramen and assistant clarence brown doing the editing   bring great beauty and intelligence to this story of poor  isolated scottish islanders   the same territory that michael powell would stake twenty years later for his first great success . visions of wind and wave  sunbacked silhouettes of lovers do not merely complement the story  they are the story of struggle against hardship .  br    br   the actors bring the dignity of proud people to their roles and pickford is brilliant as her character struggles with her duties as head of the clan  wavering between comedy and thoughtfulness  here with her father  s bullwhip lashing wayward islanders to church  there seated with her guest  s walking stick in her hand like a scepter  discussing her lover  played by matt moore .  br    br   see if you can pick out future star leatrice joy in the ensemble . i tried  but failed .  ,1
anyone who loves the rheostatics  music is going to enjoy this film . i have some minor complaints  mainly about pacing and the casting of certain actors  not maury  who aren  t really convincing in their roles  but i don  t have time write a detailed review . i just want to warn anyone who has seen this film or plans to watch this film as presented cbc television in canada the version that airs are the cbc is like the reader  s digest version of whale music    don  t watch it . it cuts out entire scenes and subplots  if you can them that  from the film . the cbc  which presents most of films untouched  took half the guts out of whale music . i don  t know why . it  s horrible what they did to the film . rent the video or watch it in a theatre  but don  t watch it on cbc television .  ,1
if you like original gut wrenching laughter you will like this movie . if you are young or old then you will love this movie  hell even my mom liked it .  br    br   great camp     ,1
pretty good picture about a man being in the wrong place at the wrong time . if the murderer wanted to whack the dame  why not just off her and let the cops try to figure out whodunnit  involving all these characters in the plot is dangerous  not to mention all the mouths you  d have to worry about staying shut . why did the depressed lady go out to the bar when she could barely sit up in a chair or say a word  are there really cops out there who are wise cracking  gum popping  grinning apes who approach a suspect in such a glib manner  this probably played well back before the wheel was invented  but it is so corny and unbelievable today . catch the manic drum break by elisha cook his frenetic hammering never once matched the recording . his mad facial expressions made up for the off kilter stick sync .  ,1
don  t be swayed by the naysayers . this is a wonderfully spooky film . this was a thesis project for the writer  director  jt petty . he did a great job of having me on the edge of my seat . i never really knew what to expect  and for a jaded horror  movie goer  this is nirvana  the film concerns an elderly man who lives in a isolated log cabin in the woods . one day  while searching for his cat in the woods  he witnesses the murder of a child  or does he  he agonizes about this the rest of the film . what is most unusual about this film is that here is no dialogue until the last few scenes . i found this to be intriguing . the writer manages to get hold of your senses and gives them a relentless tug . give this film a go  you won  t be disappointed .  ,1
i  ve seen this film at least  times since    and it  s still great every time i see it . it  s a very compelling version of the opera carmen  with amazing flamenco dancing  bare bones sets  and  of course  wonderful music .  br    br   this telling of carmen is a story within a story  with each paralleling the other  until the doubly tragic ending . obviously a low budget spanish production  the film contains dancing by some of spain  s premier flamenco dancers . the combination of the soaring opera music and the sound of the dancers boots on the wooden stage  makes the telling of the story even more powerful .  br    br   it  s independent movie making at it  s best and probably my all time favorite foreign film .  ,1
i cannot believe the same guy directed this crap and dracula     . dracula     was innovative  fresh  and well written  if poorly acted .  br    br   this pile can  t even claim that . it starts with the defeat of dracula at the end of dracula     . then ignores the narrative afterwards describing what happened after that . following the narrative properly could have made this a good sequel somehow  but craven chose to go in the style of his older films  having no good tie but the main villain  s name .  br    br   even the actor playing dracula was different  going from dark hair in dracula     to a blonde here  .  br    br   avoid this movie if you have any respect for your taste in movies .  ,0
that was definitely the case with angels in the outfield . it was on tv last night and i believe i hadn  t seen the film since my sophomore year in high school and i  m now in my  th year of college . although the film has many flaws  it is just so touching that you can  t help but sit down  watch it  and enjoy yourself . it is also hilarious . danny glover  s ranting is just so over the top that you can  t help but laugh out loud at him at most time . it adds to the film and i  m sure it  s exactly what the director wanted . you actually feel for the characters in the film even though the development isn  t the best . a must see . i highly recommend .  br    br        ,1
i was up late flipping cable channels one night and ran into this movie from about   minutes into the start  every time i even thought going to bed  something kept on telling me to keep on watching it even though it was way way way past my bedtime .  br    br   this movie could have been another easy slam dunk anti  gun film  but instead they chose to examine the aftereffects of the shootings . and even better  the movie kept on with the real life  just when you think they are going to take the easy and obviously contrived way out  a twist comes along and changes the whole outlook of the movie . this film not only doesn  t follow the formula  it shows how other events often lead up to and  or affect what happens afterwards .  br    br   i only wish the filmmakers had explored the issues around anti  depressant drugs more  the kids from columnbine who did the shootings were on them for years and it was frightening to watch the way deanna popped them every time the nightmares started . up until recently they were dispensing the stuff like candy and only now do they even begin to understand what long term effects the drugs have . it was very refreshing to see that the mental illness aspect of the story was given quite a bit of film  having a relative who suffers from a mental illness  i can say that the movie was dead nuts on in every aspect of mental illnesses . bravo to the director and writer who obviously did their homework on those issues . and for those who think certain things couldn  t happen in a hospital  i don  t want to tell any particulars   you  re dead wrong on that too  i  ve been there . the script was so real it was amazing .  br    br   go buy this film and show it to your teenage kids before it  s too late . someday they  ll thank you for it .  ,1
ella was excellent  franchot was unavoidably over  the  top  but he played similar parts in other films such as  the man on the eiffel tower   and alan was nearly non  existent but the film certainly  thrilled  .  br    br   mild spoiler ahead i wonder how many times elisha cook got strangled in his films but i seem to recall various other examples . i will avoid naming the murderer but i think it  s necessarily obvious because of the plot  thriller  demands .  br    br   a very well  done but dated film noire  for example everyone smoked like crazy and the police were really stock characters . and no dead bodies were ever shown  unlike today  s gore fests .  done in the familiar short  scene tableaux format of the period .  br    br    out of   .  ,1
impenetrable rubbish . this has to be one of the worst movies i have ever seen . the dialogue is ghastly  the horror effects are laughable . the only thing that kept me watching was the ever  splendid and totally underrated michael cule .  ,0
the only reason i elected to give this flick a shot was due to the presence of oscar winner ernest borgnine . all i can say is  it was the greatest waste of a good actor ever put to film . as far as i could tell  borgnine was the only actor in it . the other performances were so uniformly terrible  i am amazed a studio would actually pay the  performers  to appear . couple this level of talent in the acting department with a story so plodding and insipid that i thought my eyes were going to start bleeding by the time the credits rolled  and you have a perfect cinematic disaster . obviously the movie was made to appeal to an audience of children  and to its credit  it was better than most of the original programing on the disney channel and similar kid  focused networks . but honestly  that is not saying much .  ,0
that  s a problem i have with movies that come on television  when there is nothing else to watch . i somehow get sucked into really bad movies .  br    br   but this one was fairly watchable . the concept of being the only ones left on earth after a comet  then finding out zombies are around makes me laugh . and that  s why i gave this movie a   instead of  . the story was stupid . . . but in that way that makes you laugh  too stupid  funny  .  br    br   i think i only watched it because the guy from star trek was the lead . i was surprised to see him as a younger guy . . . and he was the only funny character anyway .  ,0
the first and second seasons started off shakily  with good episodes sandwiched in between average ones  and at times resorting to clichd stories . but once it started to set up the universe in which it exists and started to develop it  s characters more  it became a lot more fun and entertaining .  br    br   the main reason this show succeeds it because of four men richard dean anderson  peter deluise  joseph malozzie and paul mullie . richard  s dry sense of humour makes to show so much better  peter  s directing is excellent and makes any episode so much more entertaining  and joe  paul never fail to make a funny  interesting episode together .  br    br   once you understand what the show is about and get to know the characters  i doubt you won  t like the show . for those getting into the show i suggest the episodes  the other side   a good serious episode  and  window of opportunity   a classic comic relief episode .  ,1
how can you resist watching a film with some swing  it  s a delightful little film full of wonderful actors and a wonderful story line . too bad they don  t tour out here . . . i  d go see them . see it if for no other reason than to hear some good music .  ,1
i  m glad that users  as of this date  who liked this movie are now coming forward . i don  t understand the people who didn  t like this movie  it seems like they were expecting a serious        treatment  c  mon  how the hell can you take the premise of a killer snowman seriously  the filmmakers knew this was a silly premise  and they didn  t try to deny it . the straight  faced delivery of scenes actually makes it funny  yes  there are times where the low budget shows  such as that explosion scene   but i think an expensive look would have taken away from the fun of the movie  so if you like b  movies  and the goofy premise appeals to you  then you  ll certainly like  jack frost  .  ,1
lol  not a bad way to start it . i thought this was original  but then i discovered it was a clone of the     remake of king kong . i never saw king kong until i was   . i saw this film when i was  . the film  s funky disco music will get stuck in your head  not to mention the film  s theme song by the yetians . this is the worst creature effects i  ve ever seen . at the same time this film remains a holy grail of b  movies . memorable quotes  take a tranquilizer and go to bed .   put the yeti in your tank and you have yeti power .  i remember seeing this film on movie macrabe hosted by elvira . there is one scene where it was like king kong in reverse  in king kong he grabs the girl and climbs up the building  but in this film he climbs down the building and grabs the girl  who was falling   also around that year was another kong clone mighty peking man       which came from hong kong . there is a lot of traveling matte scenes and motorized body parts . this film will leave you laughing . it is like i said  just another king kong clone . rated pg for violence  language  thematic elements  and some scary scenes .  ,0
mean  spirited  ugly  nasty retro  action thriller  about a bodyguard who is determined to find  and destroy    the killers of the girl he was supposed to protect . this film is almost an anachronism in today  s politically correct atmosphere . director scott doesn  t have any desire to apologize for the inherently immorality behind the film  s dramatic structure . scott is either not aware or doesn  t care for   years of social advances . i really don  t think we will see a more violent film any time soon  so you better go and see this one while you can . despite its relentless grimness  i think the movie is a powerful example of cinema at its most sinister  exploitative  and effective . scott has a tough thing to sell  but i think i  m a buyer . the extraordinary technical aspects of this film are just too effective for me to ignore . scott  s directorial choices are simply astonishing  and he pulls a great performance out of denzel washington . sensitive souls need to stay away from this one  but i recommended it to those viewers looking for a great  action  filled movie .  ,1
i am so insulted by this movie  it  s not even funny . . . and i thought  mulan  was unbelievable  however low my expectations of disney have become  i never figured they  d do something so stereotypical yet so off . there is no respect here for any true chinese culture  just the hollywood tradition of random martial arts .  br    br   i appreciate that they tried to make wendy into a normal teenage girl . . . but  fortunately  most normal teenage girls   particularly asian teenage girls   are much less obsessed with such shallow aspects of life . and from a cultural stand point  it  s almost impossible . yes  there are girls who are wrapped up in popularity and fashion  but they  re pretty rare . and even the ones who are are still fairly decent scholars . another stereotype  maybe  but a fairly true one . because that  s how chinese parents work . that  s how chinese values work . if they wanted to go for authenticity  they would  ve made wendy an ironic girl with glasses and a love  hate relationship with her family .  br    br   this just adds to my frustration with american movies . asian culture isn  t about meditation and vague  nature  oriented phrases that sound wise . we don  t walk around smiling enigmatically all the time  and we don  t all know some form of martial arts . we  re a people  and i  d appreciate it if someone would write an asian part that doesn  t portray us as some sad caricature .  ,0
  the invisible mouse  is a delightful and different tom  jerry  s cartoon . it features the usual cat  mouse chases and battles  but in a different way this time . jerry accidentally falls in a bottle of invisible ink and is obviously very glad about this because he realizes that he can prepare lots of  surprises  for tom  scare him  torment him and confuse him .  br    br   as much as it is weird  it  s also very cool and funny to see what we can  t see jerry invisible . it  s amusing to see things lifting up in the air without seeing who  s doing it  we know who  right    it  s like those things had a life of their own or even almost like a matter of ghosts . it  s equally amusing to see jerry eating some candies and fruits while he  s invisible . i really like that instrumental music which plays when he  s not visible .  br    br   some of the best jokes on this short are when tom sees jerry  s shadow and slams him and even when tom tries to slam him with a frying pan and jerry writes  missed me  . i also like when jerry drinks tom  s chocolate milk  becoming visible again and with a happy look on his face .  br    br   overall  this short has the basic ingredients needed for a classic cartoon humor  entertainment  fun and some nice artwork too .  ,1
  nacho libre         br    br   directed by jared hess  br    br   starring jack black  ana de la reguera  hctor jimnez   darius rose  br    br   mpaa rating  pg      for some rough action  and crude humor including dialog   br    br   say what you will about it  i know some people who despise it to no end   but i have always thought that  napoleon dynamite  was a funny movie   not the brightest brick on the wall  but a funny movie  nonetheless . jack black is also a very funny man   irritating at times  yes  and massively overrated by adolescent audiences who practically worship him  but funny . there has rarely been a jack black comedy that i did not enjoy to some degree . so  i was very happy to hear that jared hess  the writer and director of  napoleon dynamite   and jack black would be teaming up for a movie about a spanish friar who becomes a wrestler to save an orphanage . my only reservation was that the plot seemed a little too thin . unfortunately  my one reservation turned out to be downfall of the entire movie . this plot  had it been done as a skit on some such show as  saturday night live  or possibly even  mad tv   would have worked flawlessly . unfortunately  the plot runs far too thin over the approximate one and a half hour runtime and this one  joke comedy falls flat .  br    br   nacho was raised in a mexican monastery and became a devout man of the lord . feeling shunned by the entire monastery  nacho  black   now the monastery  s cook  decides to follow his dreams to become a professional wrestler . as the monastery  s finances hit an all  time low  nacho decides to join a wresting tournament so that he can win the prize money and provide good food for the monastery  s orphanage . this plot sounds so sweet and caring . it seems like the perfect movie for jack black . look what he did with  school of rock  after all . well  to my displeasure  this plot is almost completely ruined by offensive and gross humor that just takes away from the heart of the movie . it is again hollywood  s way of showing that they feel that teen audiences will only understand fart jokes and stupid humorof course  for all i know  maybe that is the general thought of teenagers  as many seemed to enjoy this movie . watching an obese woman scurry like a mouse across the floor will certainly make people laugh  but don  t expect to get an award for putting it in your movie . a seven  year  old could make up the same joke .  br    br   the performances in  nacho libre  are actually good . jack black proves once again that he is absolutely hilarious and that he can make even the most idiotic  worthless lines in ever put on paper comical . unfortunately  this movie just wasn  t enough for him . it didn  t give him anything to go on and the only reason any of his jokes worked was because of him . i had never seen or heard of ana de la reguera before  but now i can say that  not only is she quite talented  but she is also one of the most beautiful women to have ever graced my eyesight . she just clicked in the role and it worked wonderfully well . hctor jimnez  who plays nacho  s bumbling partner  esqueleto  kept me laughing continuously . he did a very nice job and it was very effective when partnered with that of jack black  s . darius rose  who plays an orphan named chancho  didn  t have many lines  but  what can i say  i just enjoyed him . he was adorable . the rest of the cast did their job . it is unfortunate that they were wasted on such a sub  par movie .  br    br    nacho libre  just does not work . its plot is stretched far too thin . the heart of it all is soiled by moronic humor and sickening jokes that just don  t work . i very rarely laughed and  if i did  it was because of jack black or another member of the cast . and that leads me to the bright side of  nacho libre   yes  the cast . this cast was justwell  for lack of a better word  they were on . they all clicked  had excellent chemistry together  and pumped as much life as possible into the flat script . after jared hess  s  napoleon dynamite  kept me thoroughly entertained for the entirety of the movie  i was surprised to find myself so often bored with  nacho libre  . something was lost here and i have yet to understand what it was . all i know is that  nacho libre  is not a good movie and yet  because of its cast  it is completely worthless . there is a small reason to watch  if only to watch jack black work . but  if you are not a fan of jack black  then avoid this movie like the plague . i like black  but i am done with this movie and with this review .  br    br   final thought yikes  this is jared hess  s surprisingly disappointing follow  up to his hysterical  napoleon dynamite  .  br    br   overall rating      c   ,0
this is one of the most irritating  nonsensical movies i  ve ever had the misfortune to sit through . every time it started to look like it might be getting good  out come more sepia tone flashbacks  followed by paranoid idiocy masquerading as social commentary . the main character  maddox  is a manipulative  would  be rebel who lives in a mansion seemingly without any parents or responsibility . the supporting cast are all far more likeable and interesting  but are unfortunately never developed . nor do we ever really understand the john stanton character supposedly influencing maddox to commit the acts of rebellion . at one point  i thought  aha  maddox is just nuts and is secretly making up all those communications from escaped mental patient stanton  now we  re getting somewhere   but of course  that ends up to not be the case and the whole movie turns out to be pointless  both from maddox  s perspective and the viewer  s . where  s ferris bueller when we need him   ,0
this is a good movie  a good family movie to watch if you have nothing else to do . if you are expecting this movie to be word to word from the book  you will be very very disappointed . i was somewhat disappointed because i read the book a few times when i was in elementary school .  br    br   this is about a new kid in town named billy . he makes a bet with the school bully and the bet is not like most bets . billy has to eat   worms in one day or the bully wins .  br    br   the acting is ok  probably the worst part of the movie . the kid actors over exaggerate on many things . they think it  s apocalypse if billy does not eat the worms . hallie eisenberg did a magnificent job  though .  br    br   the plot line is good as a movie  but it sucks as a book adaptation . i was able to watch this movie without looking at the time . . . . sometimes .  br    br   overall  this was a good family movie with some weak points . i rate this movie     .  ,1
sorry  but i will spoil both the plot line and the ending for you in hopes of avoiding a holiday fiasco like the one that i now face . the father dies and the mother asks santa in a letter to bring him back to the family for christmas  . . . and santa does . dad is peachy  happy healthy and totally unaware of the fact that he had died . all ends syrupy sweet .  br    br   but as a parent who recently watched my five year  old lose his best canine friend  it was a horror flick . now my son is convinced that all he has to do to bring his buddy back is to ask santa  do not underestimate the willpower of a young heart  no amount of persuasion will convince him that it was only a movie and that his dog is not coming back for christmas . it has been heart breaking to watch his joy only to know that christmas eve he will have to face his loss afresh .  br    br   shame on you on behalf of all the believers that have lost a loved one recently . it is hard enough to deal with the loss one time for a child  but there are some wishes that we shouldn  t even portray as a possibility .  ,0
antitrust falls right into that category of films that aspire to make some great point while being uplifting yet falls completely flat . i don  t hate the film  but it is missing key elements  such as suspense . there have been other attempts to make an engaging film about computers  such as hackers and the net . they all fall short . the improbable ending of both the net and antirust seem to be nearly identical . these movie endings suffer from one huge error in perception people in the pc business having this over  indulgent self ego that assumes the general population lives it  s life waiting to hear the latest news about pc  s and software . i have worked for many companies and industries  and they all seem to suffer from an expanded view of their own self  importance  as does this film .  br    br   the way they introduced plot lines was pathetic . showing milo  who is deathly allergic to sesame seeds  almost ingest one from a restaurant breadbasket crossed the line of stupidity . only his  girlfriend  prevented him from sure death . this makes one wonder how milo could have survived as long as he did  braving the perils of big mac buns and sesame seed breadsticks  as they cloak themselves as  well . . . . sesame seed breadsticks and big mac buns .  br    br   antitrust also doesn  t provide much suspense . the patterned and predictable plot twists are easily figured out long before they are revealed  come on  was anyone really stunned when yee jee tso was killed    thereby destroying any real shock value . and here again we have yet another film  story where at the end  the bad guys are chasing the good guys to  get the disk  . we need to have a moratorium on this simple simon plot line for about   years . still  i pressed on . maybe the ending would be the payoff  but no . the completely ridiculous ending where we have the head of company security  another supposed evil guy  turn around and be the good guy that enables milo to bring down n . u . r . v ceo gary winston was laughable . and of course  the news coverage of the arrest of gary winston is more fevered than when hinckley or oswald was brought into custody . gary winston  played by tim robbins  is a cardboard cutout of the same character robbins played in arlington road . but that fits perfectly here in antitrust  which should be called  anticlimactic  or  anti  original  .  br    br   in the years to come  this film will likely be banished  to be shown only on your local third rate uhf channel .  ,0
this is the second movie i saw for horrorfest this past weekend  the gravedancers being the first . gravedancers was better . i can only guess from watching this that the production must have been quite limited . i will admit the story started out interesting but really fizzled for me in the end . we weren  t really given time to sympathize or understand any of the characters which only made each of their erratic characteristics even more annoying . i have to mention that there was also a bit of mis  casting with a    year  old boy acting as sheriff . the only reason i sat through the whole film was to find out what the big secret was  which turned out to not be all that interesting . some more background about the family would have helped but they didn  t really seem like a family at all to begin with .  br    br   to me  this film is so amateur that i couldn  t even see putting it on dvd . the four rating is for the initial potential the story might have had . this was one to skip for horrorfest .  ,0
the movie was awful . the theater was dead with silence  cause everyone was embarrassed to be in there watching such trash . i think someone gave jet li a lobotomy and made him perform a script with dialogue written by a five year old . the martial arts are  ok   but when put next to the jackie chan movies and  the matrix  you  re better off seeing one of those .  ,0
first of all  this film is glacially slow  moving  and i can see most viewers losing patience with it altogether in the first thirty minutes .  br    br   the film  s subject matter was one i think would form the basis of an excellent film what was most lacking here was a plot that would advance the underlying themes .  br    br   it  s unfortunate  because in the hands of a writer like  say  lanford wilson  i think symbolism like a mountain  lion invading a school campus could take on great  tragic proportions without being heavy  handed .  br    br   i think  with a good script supporting the film  the same filmmaker  with the same tastes  and even with the same actors  who didn  t really even get a chance to impress me   might have been able to present a meaningful and touching depiction of the pains and struggles that a boy goes through when he develops a powerful  crush  on an older boy that he admires .  br    br   however  i  m sorry to say that without this foundation  and armed with a vague  dull  witted  and vastly uninteresting script  without any sort of plot in sight  and lacking any sort of sensible structure  for example  after viewing it  i believe you will find that you cannot point to climactic scenes  and instead  will find yourself enumerating  well  maybe that scene  or that one  were climaxes . . .     the result is   minutes of tedium .  br    br   without a good plot  we never get terribly interested in any of the characters their trials and difficulties are simply dull and boring .  br    br   without a good plot  dramatic devices and surrealistic directorial liberties become puzzling and confusing rather than enhancements to the story  line . i never really could believe  for example  the creation of  leah  and i think that most viewers would be utterly baffled by the conventional way in which her telephone calls were filmed .  br    br   as the film stands  i  m afraid it  s one i cannot recommend at all . what i can never understand is why a film like this one isn  t re  made by an enterprising film  maker . . . instead of all the mediocre remakes of films that were superlatively good in the first release  all it needs is a good script  written by good writers  and i think this film could be easily turned into an unforgettable classic about an aspect of male coming  of  age that is rarely treated in drama . all the elements that were so tedious and seemed so recherche in the film  the messages written on the boy  s belly  the  leah  scenes  the television  screen fantasies  could become rich if underpinned with a good storyline .  br    br   i see in quite a few comments that people are talking of this film as somehow being about a  gay  subject  and i think that  s mistaken . obviously  the  crush  depicted is that of a newly pubescent boy on an older adolescent boy  but the character of logan is far too young to have settled on any particular sexual choices  and  indeed  in his depicted masturbation fantasies  we see all sorts of stimuli  sexual and non  sexual  as we would expect in a very young boy like him . i believe  crushes  such as logan  s are common among male youths who grow up to have a decided preference for female sex  partners .  ,0
hot millions is a great movie in every way . a fun  offbeat story with wonderful performances by four of the best professionals ever to work in the business . peter ustinov is brilliant  as usual  and maggie smith    definitely one of the greatest actresses of all time    is a total delight . karl malden and bob newhart round out the cast and are also perfect . if you want a movie that has perfect casting  this is it . what is so impressive is the way these people work off each other in such a natural and effortless way  creating lots of laughs and fun moments throughout . peter ustinov was a genius with a wonderful sense of humor and this is one of his most memorable performances . the direction  photography  and editing are also first  rate  and it  s a great time capsule of london in the    s . it  s definitely on my all  time favorites list .  ,1
if the themes of the girl from missouri sound familiar it should . that  s because anita loos who wrote the screenplay here also wrote the classic gentlemen prefer blondes . unlike marilyn monroe in that film  jean harlow will accept any kind of jewelry from men of means .  br    br   and it  s men of means that jean harlow is after . she leaves the road side hash house run by her mother and stepfather because she  s decided that the best way to gain the easy life is to marry it . her talents as a chorus girl are limited  but she  ll be able to trade in on that beauty .  br    br   her odyssey starts with her and friend patsy kelly getting an invitation to perform at a party thrown by millionaire lewis stone . but unbeknownst to jean  stone  s just having a wild last fling before doing himself because of the moneys he owes not owns . still she wrangles a few baubles from him that fellow millionaire lionel barrymore notices .  br    br   lionel  s amused by it until jean sets her sights on his playboy son  franchot tone . after that he is not amused and he looks to shake jean from climbing the family tree .  br    br   the girl from missouri went into production mid adaption of the code so it went under peculiar censorship . i  ve a feeling we would have seen a much more risqu film . still jean harlow as a younger and sassier version of mae west is always appreciated . what a great comic talent that woman had  seeing the girl from missouri is a sad reminder of the great loss the world of film sustained with her passing three years later .  br    br   ironically enough the casting of patsy kelly with harlow was no doubt influenced by the successful shorts kelly was making with another famous platinum blonde  thelma todd . harlow and kelly have the same easy chemistry between that patsy had with thelma . todd would also die a year later in a freak accident  suicide  homicide that no satisfactory explanation has ever really been given .  br    br   don  t miss the girl from missouri  it  s bright and sassy  must be from all that sparkling jewelry .  ,1
richard brooks  the last hunt was a film star stewart granger couldn  t even stand to hear mentioned  he even tore up a vintage poster for the film when presented it for signing in his later years  but then the director did run off with his wife  so it  s understandable . for anyone else this is one of the best of the adult westerns of the   s  and years ahead of its time in its attitude to the environment .  br    br   in many ways it plays almost like a sequel to one of anthony mann  s westerns that see their heroes dragged to their redemption kicking and screaming against it every step in the way . here granger  s legendary buffalo hunter has already seen the light but  after a buffalo stampede costs him his herd of cattle in a fit of poetic justice  he  s dragged back into the darkness by robert taylor  s callous and proudly racist gunslinger  justifying it on the grounds that  i  ve already got the guilty conscience . i might as well have the money as well .  raised by indians  he  s fully aware of the damage he  s doing as the disappearing buffalo heads for extinction  and he gradually becomes almost as consumed with self  loathing as taylor is with hate . when the two men fall out over debra paget  s squaw  the sole survivor of a band of indians taylor kills  and a white buffalo hide that  s priceless to the hunters and the indians for very different reasons  a showdown becomes inevitable  though the outcome certainly isn  t .  br    br   taylor  s is certainly ironic casting  it was granger turning down many of the epic roles mgm developed for him in films like quo vadis and ivanhoe that gave taylor his   s comeback after years of steady decline . his hair color may not convince but his performance does  a shallow and violent man so consumed with hate that he doesn  t wear a gun  the gun wears him . granger  s accent isn  t always convincing  but he makes a good quiet hero in the jimmy stewart mold  trying to keep hold of his newfound decency and reconcile his actions with his beliefs before finally getting a chance to make amends . russ tamblyn  s halfbreed skinner and lloyd nolan  s one  legged old  timer also give as good as they get  but the real star is the script tightly plotted with an excellent eye and ear for character  not to mention an ending stanley kubrick borrowed for the shining  it balances historical revisionism with entertaining drama without ever selling either short . the new french dvd is extras  free but does boast a  .     transfer with an english soundtrack .  ,1
an end of an era was released here in the states in spring     with  the rookie   a disney live action film that seemed to be the  best for last       it took place right here in texas  actually  the story began in west texas  as evidenced by an area code found on a sign over there . it was about a high school coach who was so convinced by his high class baseball team that he decided to go professional       br    br   what i liked about this movie it was sooo nice      it was a very good sports movie  ala  the mighty ducks  trilogy . it had also taken moviegoers across texas  from somewhere between the panhandle and el paso all the way to the metroplex  where i live  . i can tell because i recognize that ballpark  was  the ballpark in arlington  now it  s  ameriquest field    it was nice to see disney  s  golden age  end here in my area       br    br   r . i . p .  br    br   golden age of disney  br    br       s  spring      br    br    it all started with a mouse . . . and it ended with baseball .   sobs   br    br         ,1
i think you would have to be from the usa to get a lot of the jokes . but if you liked princess bride and forest gump  you would like this movie . you can  t compare the quality of the filming to those of course  but having the cameraman trip was obviously done on purpose . killer tomatoes is a hundred times better than nepolean dynamite . just my opinion . i  m sure that people from france would not appreciate the caricatures of the french . so this film isn  t for a world audience . and while i am not a trained film critic  i know what i like . i couldn  t stop laughing through the whole movie . my sides and my jaws were hurting at the end of the movie .  ,1
if you want a fun romp with loads of subtle humor  then you will enjoy this flick .  br    br   i don  t understand why anyone wouldn  t enjoy this one . take it for what it is a vehicle for dennis hopper to mess with your head and make you laugh . it ain  t shakespeare  but it is well done . ericka eleniak is absolutely beautiful and holds her own in this one  better than any episode of baywatch  and shows a knack for subtle humor . too bad she hasn  t had many opportunities to expand on that .  br    br   tom berenger fits his role of  real navy  perfectly and william mcnamara does a solid job as a hustler .  br    br   throw in a walk  on by hopper in the middle of the chase for  the cherry on this sundae  and you  ve got a movie that kept my attention and kept me laughing . i bought this one as soon as it was available .  br    br   brain  candy .  ,1
mighty morphin power rangers came out in      supposedly based on the japanese sentai television show that started back in the     s . now as a fan of japanese action films and series  you would think i would get a kick out of this show .  br    br   you could not be more wrong . what worked in the japanese version has become a complete abomination of television with mighty morphin power rangers .  br    br   mmpr is based on five teenagers who get powers to becomes costumed superheroes with robotic dinosaurs who form an even bigger robot .  br    br   now this premise is more far fetched and more laughable than anything in either transformers movie  yet  the ridiculousness of this show is often overlooked .  br    br   it was followed by two really bad  and i do mean  really bad movie knock offs  and the actors starring in this series  completely disappeared from the scene .  br    br   if you must choose  try watching japan  s zyuranger series instead .  br    br   also  what  s up with the awful long     s haircuts and all the earrings on the guys  it makes them all look feminine   ,0
i saw this move several years ago at the central florida film festival if i recall . i liked it  it showed great potential . i guess most people here are blasting this film because the film did seem hobbled together  by the filmmaker  s own admission on the official site   the short was exhibited as a  rough  cut   .  br    br   but nonetheless  it was an easy  going comedy . i think many people try to read far too much into a comedy . all they are supposed to do is make you laugh   that  s all . i did just that at its showing  so it succeeded on that level . just my  cents anyway .  ,0
this movie was so bad it was laughable . i couldn  t resist watching it though . the plot is standard  the acting quite horrible  supporting cast such as the nutty neighbor and the lawyer friend were better actors  . kind of amusing if you have some time to waste and like seeing the conclusion to a dramatic plot .  br    br   the headliner who plays  kathy  was just fascinating because i couldn  t decide if her deadpan  flat affect was the result of bad surgery or simply bad acting  i decided it was both  . this leaves the script to comment on  which was pretty awful . pat remarks  idiotic decisions  and reckless stupidity on the part of every character in the movie . maybe this is what was so riveting i don  t know . i just watched it to see how bad it could be .  actually the dialog doesn  t even qualify to be called  cliche    but it  s almost completely inane .   br    br   all in all  very bad  cheaply made movie . the sets  the same scenes  a house  a building  were shown over and over with no artistry or actual tie  in to the action more like props that were randomly dropped into the action in a bad play . a chase scene could have been shot by any juvenile in a warehouse or an old school poorly shot  cheap props  minimal action . . . . and i still wanted to see the ending . go figure .  ,0
this one is out there . not much to say about it except that it deals with a rarely touched topic in films of beastiality . i can see why this film was banned for so long  the topics dealt within the film are still a little taboo for most of the world will say the eroticism in the film is well deserved and fits in with the mood of the film . it  s a good film that is well acted and serves a purpose . . . to shock the viewer and cross boundaries that we don  t see to often in films . i came across this film on the net that i thought i might check out . i enjoyed the film as it is thought provoking and somewhat erotic at the same time . something you don  t rarely see in films today .  ,1
this couldn  t have been better . the strong restraints on mike sullivan  s expressions couldn  t have been portrayed in any other way . tom hanks delivers the best performance of his career . young tyler hoechlin drives an emotional wheel playing the basis character for the story . and veteran paul newman gives one of his best character performances in a long time .  br    br   this film is based on a bold graphic novel by max allan collins and richard piers rayner . this is a father  son story which basically employs the two candidates solely unfit for the roles . mike sullivan had no father as a child  so john rooney took him in . although a generous man  mr . rooney involved himself in organized crime . therefore  the debt of sullivan was only to be paid off in involving himself in the business . now  sullivan has a wife and two children and is trying to keep his children safe  but at the same time pay back his boss . the events to follow  will test sullivan  s loyalty and embrace his family  s fate .  br    br   with a great adaptation by david self  the dialogue comes out seldomly  but yet very virtuous . the story unfolds in a beautiful      s setting  brilliant art direction by richard l . johnson  nancy haigh  covered with a dark rainy  snow on the ground  exterior . driving the story  is thomas newman  s wonderful irish score  settling in only when necessary .  br    br   but the most important technical element in the film is conrad l . hall  s beautiful photography . this is some of the best cinematography i  ve seen and i watch a lot of films . the scene when mike and michael are in the car  entering chicago is quite impressive . the shot starts at the front of the car  revealing mike  hanks  through the windshield . it subsequently dollys around to the side of the car  to see michael  hoechlin  awakening and peering out his side window . as it continues  it trucks sideways and dollys back  completely around the car and reveals a gorgeous scenic      s chicago .  br    br   with a great cast and crew  the principle man creates a brazenly amazing film . i  m talking about sam mendes  who made his feature film debut in     with american beauty .  won him various awards  before american beauty  mendes worked as a play director for the british theater  but decided that he wanted to move on saying that there was nothing new for him in theater . with only two films  sam mendes has marked himself in my book as one of the great directors  in a list of about twenty  five  .  br    br   the film illuminates a brazen genre that has its hits and misses and expresses the true theme brilliantly . the photography  acting and story is phenominal . i  m still waiting for scorcesee  s gangs of new york  but for now  i  m fully confident in saying that this is the  best film of the year  . considering it  s competition  signs  insomnia  minority report  thats a strong statement .  ,1
first of all let me say the first   minutes are great  the monster looks superb and the cgi is reasonably done . it  s a shame then that the rest of the movie is such a disappointment   br    br    spoilers below   br    br   from the opening scene we can see this movie is anti  american  normally this sort of stereotyping wouldn  t bother me  we brits get enough from hollywood  but here it  s not subtle about making the americans brain  dead morons . it goes past the point of realism and your left wondering if a yank has raped the directors mother .  br    br   the grieving scene was really poor and the part of the movie where it starts going downhill .  br    br   here we are introduced to the olympic medallist auntie and drunk uncle who walk into the memorial and start blaming the father for his daughters death  then hitting him before they all start rolling around on the floor crying . hardly realistic bonding at a time of crisis   br    br   the whole virus sideline is ridiculous . if the americans know there isn  t a virus  why are they wasting time  money and resources investigating  the us government agent orders the brain drilling of an innocent korean for nothing  making the americans look evil  or stupid   it wasn  t helped by the fact this guy was cross  eyed for comical effect .  br    br   the movie is about hunting the monster . us and korean special forces are assigned to finding the creature although through  out the movie they are invisible . the only people hunting the monster  in the whole of korea  is the main family and some random tramp who appears at the end to save the day  naturally a few us  korean agents try to stop them along the way .  br    br   the sister was only included in the movie so she could make the vital shot at the end . it was clichd  you knew it was going to happen but to make it worse she does bugger all until that part  and my final annoyance  how the hell did that kid survive at the end  the monster had been swimming with it  s head underwater for about  minutes  why didn  t the monster eat the kids in the first place   ,0
those familiar with the two previous cube films pretty much know what they can expect a small group of people trapped inside a bunch of booby trapped rooms  paranoia  bad acting . . . this one is a bit different though . roughly half of the film takes place outside the cube  where we get to watch the people watching the people inside the cube  or at least five of them  .  br    br   i guess cube zero aspires to explain what the deal with the cube is  but you really don  t get to know much more than what was covered in the two first films . sure  there  s sort of an explanation in there  but it feels pretty lame compared to what was suggested in the first film .  br    br   cube zero looks rather cheap  as did its predecessors   and the fact that it shows more than just a couple of empty rooms only emphasizes this feeling . i also fell pretty confident in saying that there  s no risk that any of the actors will win any awards in the foreseeable future . they have brought back the traps from cube   though   by that i mean that they  re almost the same ones  which is a bit of a shame  .  br    br   i know that many people kind of appreciate this film and its ties with the first one  but i just feel that it  s a completely unnecessary contribution to a franchise that wasn  t that great to begin with .        ,0
i can only agree with taximeter that this is a fantastic film and should be seen by a wide audience . the imagination on display  the visual interpretation of the script  the humor is constantly surprising . the two leads are great and really carry the film . my advice would be to not even watch a trailer  just rent the film and watch without expectations . i rented from blockbuster  so it is readily available in brisbane  not everyone will enjoy it but i think most people will have an opinion and that  s always good  unless it  s just  that was stupid  . i loved this film  you just don  t get to see gem  s like this every day . this should become a cult favorite . give it a try  you may just feel the same way about it as i do .  ,1
a major moneymaker for rko radio  bombardier stars pat o  brien and randolph scott as trainers at a school for bomber pilots . o  brien and scott argue over teaching methods  while their students vie for the affections of anne shirley . o  brien  s methods prove sound during a bombing raid over tokyo . scott and his crew are captured and tortured by the japanese  but the mortally wounded scott manages to set fire to a gas truck  providing a perfect target for his fellow bombardiers . stylistically  bombardier is one of the most schizophrenic of war films  with moments of subtle poignancy  the death of trainee eddie albert  alternating with scenes of ludicrous  yellow peril  melodrama  the japanese literally hiss through their teeth as they torture the helpless americans  . though it can  t help but seem dated today  bombardier remains an entertaining propaganda effort  the film is sometimes erroneously listed as the debut of robert ryan  who  d actually been appearing before the cameras since     .  br    br   anyone interested in obtaining a copy of this film  please contact me at iamaseal  yahoo . com  ,1
another day stuck indoors  another film to watch . having finally completed my christmas shopping yesterday on a cold and foggy afternoon  i had nowhere else to go to escape  the land that time forgot  . or rather  i had nothing else to watch .  br    br   doug mcclure  that bastion of leading  man actors  leads a handful of allied sailors sunk by a u  boat somewhere in the atlantic in     . capturing the u  boat  in a scene that defies logic and reason   they eventually find themselves on a strange island  apparently untouched by human hands . together  they explore the land and discover dinosaurs and neanderthals  can they escape before becoming a permanent resident of the land that time forgot   br    br   despite being made few years before  star wars   these films are light  years apart in terms of special effects . the model shots are little better than anything you would expect to see in an episode of gerry anderson  s  stingray  and the creatures aren  t much better either . when the t  rex  i  m assuming that  s what it was  was killed  it fell in the same way that zombies do when you kill them  frozen in mid  walk and collapsing  arms and legs held out like a sleeping cow that  s been pushed over . granted  the sets aren  t too bad but the lousy acting and endless explosion noises  which all sound the same  do their best to ruin credibility and your enjoyment of the picture as a whole . characters are neither believable or worthy of your sympathy as they fire their guns at seemingly anything that moves . in the end  i just didn  t care if they got off the island or not and by the time the end came  i was more relieved than entertained .  br    br   costumes are authentic enough until the cavemen arrive and it is bear  skin bikinis and loin cloths all round . and although it was fairly obvious from their actions  you wouldn  t have known that some characters were german from their accents . the whole thing just lacked some polish and cohesion  leaving the viewer confused in places and nonplussed in others . overall  this film barely registers a ripple of excitement these days although you can find some small amusement in trying to work out where colin farrell is . i spotted his name in the credits and half expected a baby to appear with an irish accent and suspect facial hair . oh well . nothing particularly great here to see then  but just about ok if you  re eating your lunch and the weather is preventing further activity .  ,0
what could have been an engaging  and emotionally charged character study is totally undermined by the predictable factor . fox is ok as nathaniel ayers  the julliard trained musician who dreams of playing with the walt disney orchestra until his bouts with schizophrenia drive him into the street and ultimately skid row . looking for a good story to boost his flagging career  reporter steve lopez robert  rehab  downey  gets to know him and tells his story . taking every element of the classic  how we hit the skids  movies  borrowing very liberally from  a beautiful mind   taking the bogus  feel good  attitude of films like  rocky   you pick the sequel number  and whipping up too much     s style melodrama all that is left on the screen is a burnt out shell of a movie . it is corny  trite  utterly predictable and plays way too often on our sentiments . i hate to say it  but this is the kind of movie that  if you say you hated it  people will give you bad looks . i really wish i could say something positive about this film  but i really can  t . the acting redeems it somewhat  but not enough for me to give it more than one star . strictly made for tv movie stuff . not worth your time .  ,0
jazz aficionados will treasure this classic short showing some of the best men of jazz just doing their thing . it  s like watching a no frills music video today .  br    br   the jazz men give us an additional treat in the person of marie bryant who sings a classic version of on the sunny side of the street . i had never heard her sing before  bryant sounds remarkably like billie holliday . that  s a compliment folks .  br    br   their instrumental work is tops as well . with the black cinema of its time fed a lot of white stereotypes  this film is to be watched and treasured . no great production values  just a lot of good music .  ,1
sam mraovich should never be allowed to touch a camera again . if he does he should be arrested on the spot . . . at the very least for petty larceny . anybody who pays even a dime to rent any of his garbage should file a claim and be compensated . this was innocently my first viewing of his  work  . . . and it will my last . ed wood looks awfully good to me right now .  br    br   when i return this piece of crap to the video store  i will personally ask that it be taken off the shelf . an active supporter of gay cinema  i am incensed and angered that this warped  exceedingly untalented man  child be allowed to distribute and package something like this  with a coltish pretty boy on the cover  jamie brett gabel  who  thankfully  has no other acting credits in imdb  and an interesting synopsis on the back used as bait  and then market it as a  movie  rental . trust me  this has no place being on any rack anywhere it is simply not a movie in any sense of the word . offensive  irresponsible junk such as this can only be detrimental to the efforts being made to promote and support gay cinema  hell  gay rights in general   for those tempting to rent this out because of the cover  you will be disappointed . gabel is not as flattering to look at on film as he is on the cover  and he appears once or twice without a shirt   that  s it . instead  the homely mroavich inflicts on us his own disgusting  sorry  looking dough  boy nakedness .  br    br   this  thing  he  assembled  is a reverse vanity project for mraovich . both he and his friend michael habousch  who  i understand  puts out similar sleazy garbage  are terrible in this . mraovich is purposely posing as a complete no  talent  in all fields   desperate to grab onto any  loser  attention he can for himself . he is to be pitied .  ,0
this movie had so much potential  a strong cast  a reasonably strong idea and clearly a decent budget . i  m not sure where it all went wrong  but each of those elements was wasted . the story went nowhere  the characters were hollow to say the least and the result was a very boring  pointless  waste of a film . i hated it . judging by the other votes  i  m in the minority here and must be some sort of freak . however  i thought this movie was dreadful . i had high hopes  but was very disappointed . a particular disappointment was jody foster  s character . a very cocky  fixer  of sorts makes a nice idea . jody was confident and sexy  but the character did nothing and went nowhere . denzel washington played the same character he always plays  enjoyable but nothing new .  ,0
this film is another example of the curse of east asian cinema two or more separate stories rolled into one film . other reviewers have obviously picked up on it as well because there are several mentions of the  first part  and  second part  . how can you have any character development or a deep plot when the characters and the story are featured for such a short time  i was enjoying the first part until it abruptly stopped  it didn  t  end   it just stopped in what appeared to be the middle of the story  to be replaced by an inane and totally unbelievable second part that seemed to focus around a girl rearranging and cleaning a guy  s apartment  wow   i look forward to the day when wong kar wai is given a decent script to work with   ,0
i first saw  breaking glass  when it was released in england in     . . i loved it then and having just caught it in august     on a canadian station it still is great . the only thing i regret is i can  t find the sound track or the dvd in the stores   . . . anyone care to shed some light or must i order it from some over priced internet company . but getting back to the film the music stands up to the test of time  hazel  kate had something to say about    s britain . . actually it was the same decade i moved to canada for some of the same reasons one being  thatcher  and what she was doing to the country at the time . please if you get the chance watch this movie you won  t be sorry   ,1

considering it was made on a low budget  the day time ended manages to make the most of its budget with some surprisingly good special effects work .  br    br   the story involves a family who are about to move into their solar  powered home in an isolated part of the mojave desert in southwestern california  only to find it trashed   by motorcycle vandals  they think . but their youngest daughter  natasha ryan  has begun to see mysterious things   a green pyramid  strange humanoid figures  etc . and only recently  the light from a trinary star explosion has caused extremely unusual auroras to show up in the desert skies . thus the family  led by jim davis and dorothy malone  finds themselves face  to  face with strange alien forces who have put them in a time  and  space warp .  br    br   mixing in elements of      a space odyssey and close encounters of the third kind  the day time ended  despite its obvious flaws and uneven acting  remains interesting due to the superb special effects work of david allen . the desert setting is very appropriate for this film  s close encounters and while the movie cannot really be compared with either kubrick  s or spielberg  s films  the day time ended is much better than many other      close encounters knock  offs . i give credit to director john  bud  cardos  whose     thriller kingdom of the spiders made for an interesting precursor to arachnophobia  for at least trying   and on that basis  i give the day time ended a  out of   .  ,1
writer  director henry brommel has done a wonderful job with his film   panic   from the year      and that includes his choice of cast william h . macy  tracy ullman  john ritter  neve campbell  donald sutherland  barbara bain  david dorfman . brommel has cast ullman and ritter in decidedly un  funny roles  and the offbeat casting is a welcome change from what we normally see .  br    br    panic  is the story of a hit man  alex  macy  who actually works for his father  sutherland  . he covers his true profession by doing mail order work by all appearances  he and his wife  ullman  and their son sammy  dorfman  are a typical suburban family . unhappy with his life  alex seeks the help of a psychiatrist  ritter   telling only his mother  bain  . in the waiting room  he meets a young woman  campbell  to whom he is immediately attracted  which complicates his situation further . his mother breaks her promise and tells his father about the psychiatrist . when alex receives his next assignment  he discovers that he is to kill his psychiatrist .  br    br   this is a profound story of a gentle  good man made into a killer by a monster of a father  with his mother  s knowledge  who kills to please his father but also can  t stand up to him and quit . his rage is so deep  seated that he has lost emotional attachment to just about everything and everyone except his son  and it  s finally his son who wakes him up out of a nearly lifelong repression . when it  s time for  panic  to moves  it does  quickly .  br    br    panic  doesn  t seem panicked at all . in fact  it moves very slowly . but it moves slowly not because it  s poorly made  the slowness is deliberate  mirroring alex  s own psyche slowly coming out of the fog . by making a decision about sara  the campbell character  and by seeing his mark  his own psychiatrist  as a living  breathing human being  alex starts to make the connections between what he does and who he is  and how they don  t jive . and the difference between the two could lead to the loss of another psyche  sammy  s .  br    br   william macy gives another brilliant performance  as a loving father  a distant husband  and a cold killer  the child of two monsters who never cared a damn for his feelings or desires  a man who realizes finally that he has to step up to the plate or have the cycle repeated .  br    br   this is not the kind of drama that plays well in a movie theater . it  s too adult  too small  too subtle  too character  driven  and too good .  ,1
this was the best movie i  ve ever seen about bulimia . it hit the exact spot of what bulimia is really about and how it  s not always about being skinny and dieting . it showed how people with bulimia tend to think about things such as their outlook on life  friends and themselves . the best line and the part that really shows what the problem with bulimia is  is when beth says   it  s not about you   that line really showed a lot about the character and others with the same problem . it showed that people with bulimia don  t have this problem because of anything that has to do with anyone else . it has to do with them and them only . it shows that it  s time to talk about the person with the problem instead of putting the attention all on themselves . it showed that beth needed to call out for attention at that moment and she needed her mom  s attention at that time the most .  ,1
this film has all the size and grandeur of many of the great biblical epics of the      s and     s . but it is also perhaps the first that really humanizes the biblical characters themselves . the best thing about it is that it does not diminish them in the eyes of the viewer . this is a unique and compelling balance that helps us to realize that even great people like david are flawed people who find their faith and greatness in facing their flaws .  br    br   the actors are all first rate in the film from gilbert barnett as david  s second son absolom through to the wonderful susan hayward as bathsheba . hayward is at her best in this film . her own truthful but larger than life style of acting is quite at home here . she is ever the seductress  but she plays the role in such a way that you sympathize with her .  br    br   raymond massey does a great job as nathan the prophet . as a child when i first saw the film  massey seemed like he truly had just conversed with the lord himself and was an awesome sight . no doubt helped also by the great music composed by the always amazing alfred newman who also had great successes in other biblical epics like  the robe  and  the greatest story ever told  along with perhaps    other films too  the cinema photography by leon shamroy is well done and adds to the size but also the intimacy of the film . henry king  a truly underrated film director who like william wyler never really pigeon  holed himself into any one genre  pulls together a larger than life production that never loses sight of the love story between david and bathsheba and david  s own deep struggle with his faith in god . the path tread in this film could have been very hokey  but king keeps it real and interesting all the way . plus we never lose the sense of mystery about trying to understand the will of god  just as david himself is struggling with the same . from the first scene where a soldier dies trying to save the ark from destruction . david is not satisfied with nathan  s answer   to paraphrase  that no one can understand the will of god . this is the journey we embark on right through to the powerful ending where david is finally confronted with himself .  br    br   finally this film belongs to gregory peck who wonderful as king david . his david is a man you can believe could rule a country ruthlessly but was at one time a faithful singer of psalms . this is one of his best performances .  br    br   i don  t see this movie on television much anymore  but when i do i never fail to watch it . i think it still holds up very well today .  ,1

worst movie of all time  wow  whoa now . you cannot be serious .  br    br   maybe it  s all about what you expect a movie to do to you . i live in oregon  so i got to enjoy the beautifully  filmed shots of familiar yet still amazingly beautiful smith rocks and other areas in central oregon  as well as the sweet cameo of our own ken kesey and ken babbs looking down on baby sissy  s cradle at the beginning of the movie  . those alone were enough to spur me to give the movie a better than  average  score .  br    br   or . . . . maybe it  s all about what expectations you have . having read the book ages ago  and thinking to myself  goodness  no one could ever make a movie out of this interesting  quirky  weird book . . . especially   years later  when mores  morays   can  t put in the accent mark online  have changed    i was actually quite pleasantly surprised when i first watched the movie when it came out in     and even liked it more today watching it again .  br    br   sissy was exquisitely cast  and i don  t care what you all say  i was also pleasantly surprised at rain phoenix  s and john hurt  s performances . i am not a lesbian nor bi nor trans  but have met many folks who are similar to the folks they were supposed to portray   and those  real  folks kinda acted the same way as these actors acted . stilted a bit  stage  ey   always a bit  on .  gus van sant is one weird native oregonian but by garsh he done a good job adapting this crazy book  imho .  ,1
i suppose that any novel that  s as much of a downer as moby dick would not find much favor with depression era audiences who had enough of their own troubles . but any resemblance to the classic herman melville novel is a pure coincidence .  br    br   in fact half of the film is a prequel to the main story as we know it  not that too much of it was kept for the film . we first meet ahab creely  he  s got a last name and a brother  as one happy go lucky soul with two legs and intentions to marry joan bennett who is father mapple  s daughter . that brother derek  played by lloyd hughes  also wants to marry bennett .  br    br   john barrymore is ahab in an over the top performance . barrymore had not quite mastered the sound cinema and he gave out with all the silent era histrionics plus a stage voice that would have shaken the rafters of any movie theater this film was playing in .  br    br   we see ahab lose his leg to the great whale moby dick and i have to say the amputation scene was pretty gruesome . of course this was all before the code . still i  m sure     audiences shuddered .  br    br   after that the story of ahab  s hunt for the whale that he thinks made him unsightly in joan bennett  s eyes . that is not exactly melville  s motivation  in fact there are no women characters in moby dick as he wrote it .  br    br   one of the things melville did was invest the crew of ahab  s ship the pequod with personalities . other than queequeg the cannibal harpooner the names are there  but not the personalities . starbuck and stubbs might as well be smith and jones .  br    br   i  d see this version of moby dick strictly for curiosity and nothing else .  ,0
i absolutely despise this movie . no wonder jose larraz  disowned  it at one point and refuses to discuss it . i admire larraz  s work  especially his more obscure slasher  sex maniac thrillers like savage lust or scream and die . his work has a kind of inescapable artiness about it that he can  t seem to switch off  owing in part to his secondary career as a painter  cartoonist . it  s too bad he never made a western  his vision would have been perfect .  br    br   black candles is easily his most notorious film and probably his best known after the masterpiece vampyres . and it  s notoriety revolves around one scene where a satanic coven enacts a bizarre rite involving extracting the reproductive fluid of a goat   symbolizing the beast   as some kind of nauseating balm to be used in preparing the waif like sister of a murdered man for her role as the bride of satan . the scene in question is staged in a way that looks rather convincing even without the display of any plumbing apparatus the goat may have been endowed with  relying upon the histrionics of the actress recruited to play the supplicant in the ritual and lots of guttural chanting on the film  s recycled musical score heard in a half  dozen films attributed to jacinto molina . the perverse nature of the scene is more implied than shown in graphic detail  heightened somewhat by the knowledge that said supplicant is actually the teen  aged daughter of the satanic priest . my but they had fun concocting this movie .  br    br   the problem with it is that there isn  t much to deconstruct or contemplate aside from the paper thin rosemary  s baby derived story of a woman being weaned into her role as satan  s bride by a sophisticated coven of satanists living in the hedgrowed outlands of a very sinister britain . led by eurohorror sensation helga line these satanists are comprised of doctors  lawyers  land owning magnates and other upper crust dignitaries who actually owe their professional success to their worship of the devil . all you have to do is sell your soul and the world can be yours  only watch out whom you may sell out to pay back petty personal conflict or you may end up being felched with a sword .  br    br   the film attempts to combine this heady satanic trip with oodles or borderline graphic sex  and should correctly be regarded as a kind of apex or culmination of the sex and horror spanish thriller traditions popularized in part by mr . molina  ms . line  and which had amazingly flourished under the disapproving eye of one generalissimo franco  the dictator who controlled spain up until     . while he lived his decree was that spanish cinema was to be free of graphic depictions of on  screen sex . spanish directors often made two versions of their films  one with the sex concealed for their own screens and one with the fornication on display for export . as difficult as it was for the filmmakers to express themselves the result was a sort of interesting tension that usually results when artists flirt with the forbidden spanish horror from the     s has a very special flavor to it that is somewhat of an acquired taste . it  s not for everyone .  br    br   but in a bizarre turn of events  without franco  s influence on their culture spanish horror sort of dried up in the late     s  when their gothic castles and demonic orgies suddenly found themselves pass when compared to new sensations like jaws and the star wars phenomenon . and without franco  s constraints their were suddenly a flood of overtly graphic thrillers that came tumbling out of the pipes in the very late   s  early   s  of which black candles is perhaps the best known due to it  s emphasis on sexual deviancy with a barnyard animal . larraz  major horror films have always revolved around sexual taboos  the lesbianism of vampyres  the incest of scream and die  deviation  but here the effect of the depravity is to overshadow the rest of the production . nobody cares about anything else but the traditionally censored trip to the goat barn  and watching a cut version without the scene in the barn is almost an exercise in pointlessness . the sex isn  t graphic enough to rate as porn and the chills aren  t chilling enough to rate as horror .  br    br   so  black candles is essentially a behavior study   here is how high society british satanists might behave in their secluded mansions out in the west midlands or whatever . between sex scenes the actors  actresses sit around and have lots of discussions . the best thing the film has going for it is an undeniably oppressive atmosphere of claustrophobia  with most of it  s action taking place in the tightly confined interiors of ms . line  s character  s mansion . nearly every avenue of fornication is hinted at so fans of soft  core sex romps with a hinting of supernatural horror will be amused  and of course the vicarious sex criminals amongst us will enjoy choking their chickens to the goat barn scene . but the ultimate conclusion of the film is silly  pretentious  intelligence insulting  and probably perfect for such an otherwise forgettable exercise in applied sleaze .  br    br        without the goat barn this movie just isn  t the same  and with the scene it  s probably a bit too much for most viewers . larraz was correct to disown it .  ,0
there  s not a drop of sunshine in  the sunshine boys   which makes the title of this alleged comedy neil simon  s sole ironic moment . simon  who adapted the script from his play  which goes uncredited   equates old age with irrational behavior   and  worse  clumsy  galumphing  mean  spirited irrational behavior . walter matthau is merciless on us playing an aged vaudeville performer talked into reuniting with former comedy partner george burns for a television special  it  s said they were a team for   years  which begs the question  how long did vaudeville last  anyway    . burns  who won a supporting oscar  has the misfortune of coming to the film some thirty minutes in  after which time matthau has already blasted the material to hell and back . the noisier the movie gets  the less tolerable and watchable it is . director herbert ross only did solid work when he wasn  t coupled with one of neil simon  s screenplays here  ross sets up gags like a thudding amateur  hammering away at belligerent routines which fail to pay off  such as semi  incoherent matthau showing up at a mechanic  s garage to audition for a tv commercial  . at this point  matthau was still too young for this role  and he over  compensates by slouching and hollering . it was up to ross and simon to tone down the character  to nuance his temperament to give  the sunshine boys  some sunniness  yet walter continues to project as if we  d all gone deaf . the picture looks terribly drab and crawls along at a spiritless pace one loses hope for it early on .     from   ,0

ok  the story  a simpleminded loony enters a life of bored to death young chick and her kid brother and wreaks havoc in their lives  is mildly interesting one . anyway  ideas are nothing  everyone has some . . .   the execution is everything .  br    br   this is what bothered me with this flick . and it did bother me immensely . the rhythm  directing  editing  was slow  the pace was uneven and the climax expected . we have seen those frigging highways five  six  seven times  why  norton character  s troubles were seen as a childish game  not enough deep to understand his problems  soul  blah and to root for or against him . is he a coward  a manipulator or just a loony  references to the  taxi driver  were ridiculous and unnecessary and for certain not in favor for this flick  or to e . n . for that matter  .  br    br   and imho  it is cowardly executed at the end . cheap emotional tricks for teenage lovers somewhere in mid america . this guy should have killed the kid  blamed the father  create a real havoc . or the kid should have killed the father at the end etc .  but no  we have gotten cheesy ending where kids miss the loony  the father is puzzled over his own life and relationship with them and the loony  of course  dies . the happy dysfunctional family stays unharmed  safe and happily bored again so we could enjoy our pop  corns  undisturbed .  br    br   and that scene where the loony enters the movie  oh my god  i would have to think long and hard to find something stupider than that  you do not shoot such a scene with a hidden camera and hidden crew . creators of that movie probably thought that was a good idea but it was more than annoying . again  if you  re a   years old girl somewhere in kansas nowhere or whatever  where and dream about having sex with a crazy man twice your age  ok  then you might enjoy this movie and its  message  .  ,0

wow   br    br   this film is the best living testament  i think  of what happened on        in nyc  compared to anything shown by the major media outlets .  br    br   those outlets can only show you what happened on the outside . this film shows you what happened on the inside .  br    br   it begins with a focus on a rookie new york fireman  waiting for weeks for the first big fire that he will be called to fight . the subject matter turns abruptly with the only existing footage of the first plane to hit the towers . you are then given a front  row seat as firefighters rush to the scene  into the lobby of tower one .  br    br   in the minutes that precede the crash of the second plane  and tower two  s subsequent fall  you see firemen reacting to the unsettling sound of people landing above the lobby . it is a sight you will not soon forget .  br    br   heart  rending  tear  jerking  and very compelling from the first minute to the last        deserves to go down in history as one of the best documentary films ever made .  br    br   we must never forget .  br    br    ,1
this movie was awesome    not quite as good as the leif garrett masterpiece longshot  but still awesome   i thought ashley looked freakin  huge compared to mary  kate in this film . i wonder why . who woulda thought they could swith places like that and almost get away with it . dad was kinda a jerk though and mom was a little too chummy with helmit head . i give it  . any one who likes this movie shoudl check out longshot .  ,0
i scooped up this title by accident with the grindhouse vol .  collection of pure euro  trash movies . but this movie has a nice stamp of approval and should deserve a better transfer than what is out there . stupednous it is not . . . satisfying it is  watching this movie i couldn  t help to wonder . . . how come sergio martino didn  t make this flick  this has his signature all over it and punctuated by edwedge fenech  alas not as well known as she should be but she did get a nice cameo in hostel ii  . double  crosses and triple  crosses underly and cement this film from beginning to end with lee van cleef oozing coolness under pressure from the  st second . did this guy have to go to italy to finally reach his potential or did the studio system let this guy slip through  besides lee  s more recognizable films  film  goers should try this on for size and see how if sergio leone would  ve lowered his epic scale down on once upon a time in america to half the running time  and    of the budget  this is what it would  ve turned out to be like . so refreshing  it should be taken in during the day at home and make it for an couch matine  ,1
the plot of this film is not strong at all  lots of holes . if you approach it as a car movie its not bad  lots of great cars in this one . the reason i like it is because i am from the area where this was filmed . i get the most enjoyment looking at the recognizable places in st . cloud mn and seeing how the town has changed since   . its an interesting historical piece for us locals . seems like whenever a film is made here everyone wants some relationship to it . it is impossible to find a copy in any of the local video stores as they were all stolen once it came out on vhs . had to get a copy from japan on ebay i find it interesting how the path of the drag race is all over town . i didn  t know the director was from st . cloud .  ,0
i saw the film at the nashville film festival . it was beautifully done  from cinematography to the acting . it  s the story of a father and son  and how they come to appreciate each other during a family crisis . beautifully written with dialog that never rings false  the film showcases the acting talents of paul reiser and peter falk  among others in this outstanding cast . the film begins with the aging father  peter falk  is trying to figure out why his wife  olympia dukakis  has left him . the father presents himself  unannounced  on the doorstep of his son and daughter  in  law . the father and son take off the next day to look at some property and end up taking a classic road trip . they fish  play pool  watch a baseball game  get drunk  get involved in a barroom brawl  and dance with strange women . but more important  they each confront the unspoken tensions that can affect any family . it  s the kind of film that touches the heart and makes one appreciate those who are closest to them .  ,1
a friend told me of john fante last summer after we got into a conversation about charles bukowski . i did not know that fante was a favorite writer of bukowski  s  an author with similar edge and humor except from one generation earlier .  ask the dust  was the first fante book i read  and it remains one of my favorite novels . the novel was a brilliant piece of writing about a sad  frightened young writer posing to himself and the outside world as an overconfident  masterfully talented author who had no idea how to write about the real world experiences he had none of . in the novel the protagonist is a virgin  with no idea how to win the graces of the women he desperately wants to write about in magazines . the story of his bizarre relationship with camilla  how he settles for his first sexual experience with a  wounded  admirer  and how he eventually is left with nothing but the story of his failed attempts at love is biting and real  with no touching hollywood ending . the film adaptation stays true to the book for a while  but meanders into the cinematic trap of love persevering through racism  sickness and death . the heart of this story lies in the fact that bandini is a jerk and camilla is f  ing crazy  and their love never was and never would be the real thing  no matter how much either of them wanted to find it in each other . this movie tore out the real meaning of the story out and replaced it with schlock . i can  t believe the man who wrote chinatown could read this book and make a movie about it that got it so wrong .  ,0
the dukes of hazzard will academy awards   best actor and actress  the persons who can say with a straight face that this was a great movie .  br    br   this  movie  was a torture to watch . so sad how an weekly half hour entertainment was destroyed by these amateurs . the only good thing about this crap was the car  i remember when daisy was a real threat to look  ward  . who  s the moron that decided that jessica simpson is hot   we know she can  t act but come on . in the tv show daisy was a fox and brunette .  br    br   all members who contributed in these waste of time please please please don  t even think about makin a sequel  a prequel or anything that  s got  do with a former tv show .  br    br   i gave a empty dvd so this  movie  could be burned  me . i sat trough it and i want my money back   ,0
this movie was a rather odd viewing experience . the movie is obviously based on a play . now i  m sure that everything in this movie works out just fine in a play but for in a movie it just doesn  t feel terribly interesting enough to watch . the movie is way too  stagey  and they didn  t even bothered to change some of the dialog to make it more fitting for a movie . instead what is presented now is an almost literally re  filming of a stage  play  with over  the  top characters and staged dialog . because of all this the storyline really doesn  t work out and the movie becomes an almost complete bore  and obsolete viewing experience .  br    br   it takes a while before you figure out that this is a comedy you  re watching . at first you think its a drama you  re watching  with quirky characters in it but as the movie progresses you  ll notice that the movie is more a tragicomedy  that leans really more toward the comedy genre  rather than the drama genre .  br    br   the characters and dialog are really the things that make this movie a quirky and over  the  top one that at times really become unwatchable . sure  the actors are great peter o  toole and susannah york  amongst others but they don  t really uplift the movie to a level of  watchable enough  .  br    br   the story feels totally disorientated . basicaly the story is about nothing and just mainly focuses on the brother  sister characters played by peter o  toole and susannah york . but what exactly is the story even about  the movie feels like a pointless and obsolete one that has very little to offer . like i said before i  m sure the story is good and interesting to watch on stage but as a movie it really isn  t fitting and simply doesn  t work out .  br    br   the editing is simply dreadful and times and it becomes even laughable bad in certain sequences .  br    br   more was to expect from director j . lee thompson  who has obviously done far better movies than this rather failed  stage  play translated to screen  project .  br    br   really not worth your time .  br    br        ,0
both robert duvall and glenn close played their roles with such believability  i simply cried . glenn close  s role as ruth  showed her wanting to deal with the situation  but she was under the domination of her husband .  let him think about what he did   robert duvall  s character  joe  said staunchly . the story depicted a rural family dealing with an accidental death of a son by his brother  called  the stone boy   meaning he was so distraught and overwhelmed by what he did  he became emotionally paralyzed . then towards the end when jason presson  s character  arnold  let it all out to a stranger  i was so broken hearted for him  that i actually thought of some of the terrible things that i did in my life . i personalized and identified with his character . frederick forrest  s and gail youngs  roles  did not add not much to the film . i thought of frederick forrest  who played ruth  s antagonistic  womanizing brother  andy  as a jerk who did nothing to try to help the situation . his wife  lou  played by gail youngs  acted like a crazy  lady smacking arnold around out of frustration with her own problems without pity and blaming him for her troubles . i could not really feel sorry for these two . though lou tried to keep her marriage together  she was unsuccessful . both did not deal with their problems effectively . they really did nothing for the film and were totally ridiculous . wilfred brimley  s minor role as the grandfather was  touching for he was the only character that showed arnold any attention . i felt his role should have been elaborated . the players were just doing what they felt was adequate and sufficient . however  i really liked the ending so much  i actually smiled and cried tears of joy . i felt good . the hillermans were a family again . i actually wanted to be a part of this family . they were so realistic .  ,1
cult classics are nearly impossible to predict . who could guess that vision quest  fight club  and      a space oddysey  movies that were panned by critics and audiences alike upon their release  would become immensely popular  like many imdbers  i consider myself a movie expert . unlike the majority of those who hated envy  evidenced by a dismal  .  rating   i found envy to be one of the funniest movies in the last decade .  br    br   the plot of the movie is ridiculous . the dialogue isn  t clever  the scenes have little continuity  and the script seems like it was written by a fourth grader . but that  s exactly why the movie is so hilarious . you see  in order to appreciate the accidental genius of envy  you have to enjoy the movie from an ironically  detached point of view .  br    br   why do i love envy  because the movie is bad to the point that it becomes good . this is the recipe for a cult classic  and envy definitely fits the bill .  ,1
before seeing this movie  i was expecting a fictional drama based loosely on ideas from the book instead  it  s the book  interrupted with dramatic scenes illustrating the different  illnesses .  that didn  t bother me much  but it hindered my enjoyment of the film . one story or even two or three long stories with excerpts from the book interspersed through the movie would have been preferable  in my opinion . if you  re going to base a movie on a psychology text  you  ve got to find a more interesting  and preferably accurate  text than this one . the film drags during parts where it  s little more than a video encyclopedia of   th century sexual psychology and would be utterly intolerable if it weren  t sexual in nature  because  sex  interesting  for most of us  even me  . luckily  there are several stories with actual character development that pull us in .  br    br   but  disappointingly  krafft  ebing  s theories of sexuality went unchallenged  for the most part . i was hoping it would use stories to show how the imperfections of his archaic view of psychology which is still held by many to this day .  br    br   so  in the end  what do you have  a detailed catalog of a few fetishes and orientations  with some mildly interesting stories showing the trials and tribulations of a few  sexual deviants  before they are cured . for most of the film  the film moves with the crawling speed  and mood  of a wake . and  as an obviously low budget film  the cinematography and acting are not exactly top tier . although i was pleased with the music  costume and interior design .  br    br   i felt this film  s subject was right up my alley  and i still feel it  s a below average film . it deserves a      a     if i were feeling extremely generous . i can  t imagine anyone enjoying this if they didn  t already have an interest in sexual fetishism .  ,0
wow  it  s been years since i last saw this movie . watching it in     is certainly different than watching it in     . initially i didn  t  think i would make it through the movie . hunt stevenson  michael keaton  was so obnoxious  arrogant and disrespectful that i found it hard to watch him . he embodied every negative stereotype of americans . if that wasn  t bad enough  once the small american town  s finest workers were shown the image only got worse . on the opposite spectrum the japanese were presented as emotionless  robotic workaholics . the movie wasn  t even all that funny  i only hung in there because of the nostalgic value of it . and i  m glad i continued the watch .  br    br   just like boxing  judges are swayed by how you finish the round . this movie went from about a three up to the seven i rated it because of the ending . the end was excellent . you always want a harmonious ending and this was just that . it was great that the town got to keep there jobs and keep the factory  but what was most special was the marriage between the japanese customs and values and the american customs and values . it was a mediocre movie that ended on a high note .  ,1
after a day at work  i sat down to relax and turned on the movie channels . the movie came up on the guide and sounded interesting so i tuned in just before it started . the first   minutes were enough to make me interested  but the lack of acting ability in jamie foxx and the slow plot movement made me want to get up and find food during the movie . if there is any credit to be given for acting in this movie it should go to david morse who at least tries to make the movie interesting . all in all  don  t plan on impressing your friends by picking this one as a renter for a movie night .  ,0
although in some aspects seven pounds is solid and interesting in some of its narrative style  gabriele muccino  s project is rather mediocre . the movie becomes more and more sappy and manipulative as it move toward the end hearts human and emotional  eyes physical and metaphorical . seven pounds is more of an amateurish imitation of alejandro gonzlez irritu  s amores perros and   grams  with lots and lots of flashbacks . the problem is the story is quite predictable from very easily on through the movie . that  s too bad  because seven pounds could have been as authentically  good  if ben and emily had been put in the right hands .  ,0
this film plays really well with an audience . especially once the chase begins . plus  trevor howard with his sensible  smart charms and jean simmons with her innocent demeanor and piercing eyes are terrific together .  br    br   the film starts as a psychological drama but after the murder it segues into a chase thriller as the two leads head for the border . some may think the chase is superfluous but actually the chase is essential because it aids in clearing the mind of the jean simmons character by getting her out of the oppressive household  plus it helps bring out the real killer  who is suddenly put into such a position that they have to finish the job . the killer rightly believed that once the simmons character was arrested she would be put away . and it is true that her lack of control in the household  as well as evidence pointing her way  there is no way she would have gotten out of the murder charge . the chase that ensues helps bring out the truth .  br    br   this is an entertaining film . seek it out if you can find it .  ,1
don  t spend your money or your time on this pitiful piece of film in the guise of cinematography . when every third word is devoted to foul language and there is no real plot as well as having a cast of old actors who are still giving the same dated performances from the past and have not evolved in their careers  leaves a lot to be said . i was expecting something better from award winning actor benicio del toro . the vision that others may have of puertorricans will be irreversibly distorted by such trash as maldeamores . a foul word at a given moment in a film may be used to emphasize a given point of view and may even be funny or sad depending on its context  see the movie elsa and fred for example  but it should not permeate the plot . the movie is a total embarrassment and there was absolutely nothing funny or even cute about this film .  ,0
the film starts with a voice over telling the audience where they are  and who the characters are . and that is the moment i started to dislike the movie . with all the endless possibilities any film director have in hand  i really find it a very easy and cheap solution to express the situation with a voice over telling everything . i actually believe voice overs are betrayals to the film making concept .  br    br   i hate to hear from a voice over saying where we are  which date we are at  and especially what the characters feel and think . i believe that a director has to find a visual way to transmit the feelings and the thoughts of the characters to the audience .  br    br   but after the bad influencing intro  a very striking movie begins and keeps going for a fairly long enough time . the lives of a middle class family and all the members individually are depicted in a perfect realistic way . i think the director has a talent for capturing real life situations . for example  a father who has to make his private calls from the bathroom might seem abnormal at first  but life itself leads us some situations which might seem abnormal but also very normal as well . i think the director is a very good observer about real life .  br    br   but that is it . after a while the realism in the movie begins to sacrifice the story  telling . i really felt like i  m having a big headache because of the non  stop talking characters . it was as if the actors and actresses were given the subject and were allowed to improvise the dialogs . it is realistic really  but characters always asking  really  is that so  etc . to each other  or characters saying  no  or  are you listening to me   ten times when saying it only once is just enough causes me to have a headache .  br    br   i also think the play practicing and book reading scenes are more then they should be . i understand that the play and the book in the movie are very much related to the plot  but i think the director has missed the point where he should stop showing these scenes .  ,0
it  s official  folks   hou hsiao  hsien doesn  t have a thought in his pretty little head . are you wondering why he chose shu qi as his muse   br    br   shu  or is that qi   doesn  t appear in this one . instead we get a snaggletoothed yo hitoto  apparently a pop star in japan   judging by her song at the end  she  s a pop star just like the girl who serves you at rockin  curry is  a actriss    and a wasted tadanobu asano  typically an indicator of quality  who is required to do nothing here but stand around and look like a mumbling asian hipster and is too old to manage even that .  br    br   hou  s philosophy  life is limbo  a big nothing  feel it and move on . i  d like to do that but hou gives us nothing to feel in cafe lumiere beyond a bland photo essay of life in tokyo circa     and the flabbergasting observation that people are ships that pass in the night  no  make that trains that pass in the day  never connecting  each hurtling to its own destination  usually some variant of a dark tunnel or maybe a bridge if they  re lucky . yikes . flowers of shanghai is one of the most rarefied  technically accomplished and mesmerizing films of all time . how could the same director who created the opening shot of that film  which features about twelve actors conversing at machine  gun speed for about ten straight minutes   an impossible directorial feat   get trapped making this laconic sub  jarmusch reality porn for two films in a row now  millennium mambo may be dead weight  but at least it has two great shots  shots that hint at hou  s true calling as the film equivalent of odilon redon those shots are the sex scene with the arrhythmically blinking lights and the opening shot of shu qi floating down a blue corridor . his m . o . while making cafe lumiere seems to have been to remove the two great shots from millennium mambo to make it more consistent . you be the judge if that sounds appealing .  br    br   hou does not need to refine   you cannot refine the limbo idea further than flowers of shanghai . he needs to expand  to bloat outwards  to release the inner expressionist and genre  revitalizer that is being squandered so senselessly on clichd minimalism . it  s time for him to do a live  action remake of akira or something . this kind of art film where the actors are supposed to be authentic because they are held facelessly in long  shot and speak in monosyllables is now every last bit as safe  ghettoized and stagnant as the hollywood action blockbuster .  what is the connection between  reality  and people who can  t talk  it seems to me that people  in real life  never stop jabbering .  then again  considering that     alone brought big  budget movies as diverse and rich in ideas as aeon flux  the island  and king kong  it  s now safe to say that even michael bay has surpassed hou  and that  s really sad .  br    br   the good news is that  though hou is in his   s  it frankly feels to me as if he hasn  t even begun . there are a couple moments in this film that show the promise is still there  such as a moody bit early on in the bookstore when the room dims to a bloody sunset  red while hitoto talks about babies with the faces of goblins . but whatever fear is holding him back  however comfortable it is to make the same film over and over and be hailed by the gullible and pretentious as the savior of cinema  hou  your time as the darling of the rotterdam  venice  toronto  berlin and whatever else film festivals is almost up and people are catching onto your ruse double  quick . two words for you atom egoyan . two more words  or maybe three tsai ming  liang . you are now cribbing from both of these tedious frauds who are about to go up their own dark tunnels forever . risk your shirt on a sci  fi epic  sell out  be reviled   but leave the social critiques to people that have no eye and no heart . let your painterly talent express itself to the full . you  re not going to ever get out of limbo otherwise .  ,0
spanish horror icon paul naschy stars in this  one of his weakest werewolf films . . . but bear with me for a moment . most people will be familiar with it under its most common television title  the fury of the wolf man  and there have been many home video versions of it over the years . if you want to be serious about giving it a fair shot though  the most workable edition i  ve seen of it goes by the title the wolf man never sleeps  and it  s an unedited and complete european version which restores a couple of disturbing scenes and contains the original nude shots which are missing from fury  s print . it is also letterboxed .  br    br   naschy plays waldemar daninsky  returning home from a trip to tibet only to find out that he  s contracted a werewolf curse and that his wife has been having an affair . he takes care of her and her lover while in animal form  but then becomes a guinea pig for a sexy woman doctor and her female assistant . apparently  the doc attempts to  tame  the werewolf  and there is a very strange sado  masochistic love scene between her and the hairy and fanged daninsky who is under her trance  at least in the original version . ultimately we get two werewolves for the price of one as daninsky battles a she  wolf   br    br   the biggest problem with the movie is that the director  according to naschy  s claims  was often drunk  and the results are indeed rather incoherent . when watching the wolf man never sleeps copy  it  s not quite as difficult to make out what  s going on  though the editing remains atrocious in spots . worst of all is occasional non  matching footage of naschy  s ravenous werewolf swiped straight from another previous film  la marc del hombre lobo  aka  frankenstein  s bloody terror   and mixed into this one without any sensible reason  the wolf  s clothing changes from black shirt to white and back again  as does his demeanor one moment the wolf is walking around lethargically in a hypnotic trance from fury  next he is growling and running around savagely from bloody terror . really bizarre .  ,0
this movie was the beatliest mormon movie made yet . it made the rm  sons of provo look like well done films  it was supposed to be funny from what i was told . the best part was the best actor in the movie  travis eberhard  if he wasn  t in the movie it probably wouldn  t have been made  he ruled   br    br     . it wasn  t funny  . it was beat  . it had thurl big t bailey  who  s character made no sense  . it was made in provo  . it didn  t make fun of brokeback  . it had larry h . miller in it  . it was the  st movie clint howard wasn  t funny in  . gary coleman chose the perfect movie  a comeback  . they should have cast at surreal life auditions  . it was made by halestorm entertainment    ,0
this is one of the movies that get better every time you see them . it  s packed with so many original and unconventional ideas that you always find a new detail . as in sabu  s subsequent movies  i didn  t see  unlucky monkey  yet  but the other ones are as great  failure  chance and humanism play great roles . the cutting and montage is inventive and artistic  without the movie being an  art  picture  but a highly entertaining one . when comparing it to  run  lola  run  you have to keep in mind that  dangan ranna  was made some years before and was shown on german tv as early as     . . . so it  s more probable that it served as inspiration for tom tykwer  s movie  and not the other way around . complementary to the other reviews i have to add that i like the acting and the ending very much . this movie is a lot of fun in many ways  and it manages to deliver a message without being annoying or pretentious .  ,1
this starts off bad  what with the three women acting like simpering junior high school wussies sitting around giggling with their gin  endless cigarettes and a caramel chocolate treat for the one who tells the best  man  story  and then it gets worse    spoiler alert    what with andie  s character falling for the young organ player who used to be her student when he was    she  s the headmistress of an english school  believe it or not   only to have him destroyed thanks to her bitch  from  hell  girlfriend  . . . and then from there  it  s basically unwatchable claptrap she forgives her  friend  and has the organ player  s love child and the  women end up as they started  drinking more gin and smoking more cigarettes blah blah blah . andie  s character throws the caramel chocolates out in the street  in a pathetic attempt to symbolize growth . have mercy .  ,0
this is far worse than those awful laurel and hardy cartoons of the   s . they were terrible  but at least they were simple ripoffs of a then stan and ollie resurgence . new audiences had rediscovered the pair  s comedic genius and the cartoons were mind  numbing garbage geared to cash in on children  s interest . it was to be expected . but  how does one even attempt to rationalize this work of . . . i can  t even think of a word . i  m sure the makers hoped it would somehow inspire another laurel and hardy revival  but you can  t inspire interest in the past with a shallow and unfunny caricature of what made the original so appealing . the impressionists  i hesitate to call them actors  do a vegas act and that  s where it belongs . the plot is even flimsier than those used in the old days  trying to stretch out two  reel ideas for a feature . if this film was someone  s first exposure to the real laurel and hardy  i  m sure that viewer would dismiss the original duo  s reputation as senility gone amok . the only movie i hate worse than this is i spit on your grave . and  you know  these filmmmakers basically did the same thing to stan and ollie .  ,0
this film is hardly good  not great at all . a few memorable scenes and the unlucky choice of pairing norma jean with an actual actress . jane russell has it all working for her  marilyn  s lesser woman and  or actress . one can only wonder why this is considered being one of the highlights of her lame career .      ,0
what is supposed to be a simple generic mystery plot involving a dead philanthropist is  in fact  a head  ache inducing tale about a bunch of characters  the only big actor being ginger rogers  in a very early role  all trying to find the murderer among a small cast of residents in a posh apartment building . these characters range from utterly stupid to downright mean . as a cheap  low budget production  most of the action revolves around rogers and her lead man  some guy  i don  t care who he is  cause he really sucked  talking about their various possibilities of solving the crime  while being constantly cut off by an absurd detective with his head in his butt . honestly  i  ve never had a worse time watching an old b  rate movie of this type  and i  ve seen some real head  slappers .  br    br   oh  and the butler didn  t do it  because there wasn  t a butler . but pay attention to the guy who  s closest to a butler . there ya go .  br    br     polarisdib  ,0
that  s what i found myself saying time after time in the remarkably inept  rd act of this sorry excuse for a film . first off  the computer effects are absolutely mind  blowing  those computer wizs  really deserve a pat on the back . the rest of the movie  though . . .  br    br   none of the characters act in a realistic manner  especially in the aforementioned  despicable  rd act  i promise i won  t give it away  but trust me  it  s not worth keeping a secret   . a lot of laughs in the film come unintentionally  like when they try to explain that an invisible man  s eyelids don  t work . please  give the viewers more credit than that     br    br   some of the sexual aspects of the film were interesting . what would you do  after all  if you were invisible  no one could catch you  these issues were dealt much more intelligently in the classic the invisible man from     . there is one scene of violence in particular that is so incredibly ambiguous  and is not mentioned once later on . if more attention had been paid it  kevin bacon  s mad scientist might have made a little more sense .  br    br   the movie would actually be much more successful as a porno  since the premise could actually be carried out in a unique and interesting manner . but this piece of work . . . go see something else . or don  t  and live with the consequences   br    br        ,0
this is one of the best movies i  ve ever seen . it has very good acting by hanks  newman  and everyone else . definitely jude law  s best performance . the cinematography is excellent  the editing is about as good  and includes a great original score that really fits in with the mood of the movie . the production design is also a factor in what makes this movie special . to me  it takes a lot to beat godfather  but the fantastic cinematography displayed wins this contest . definitely a best picture nominee in my book .  ,1
if you are a fan of zorro  indiana jones  or action in general this is a must  see . directed by republic  s ace team of william witney and john english  and starring reed hadley as don diego  zorro  this serial delivers  i won  t bore you with the plot  who cares  less talking  more fighting   what really matters here is hadley  s superb interpretation of the character  s and the stunt work of dale van sickel and yakima canutt .  br    br   stunt spoilers follow   br    br   you can see the influence this film had on lucas and spielberg   zorro gets caught in the original version of the star wars trash compactor in one chapter  trapped on a rope bridge a  la temple of doom in another  does a raiders horse  to  coach transfer and even flees through a tunnel while the baddies knock over a huge water tank and flood the tunnel behind him  exactly as mola ram does to indy in temple of doom . in addition to all this  the whip action is great as zorro disarms villains  swings to safety  etc . with his trusty lash . most of the sword work is fair to lame  except for chapter one  which features a terrific sword brawl in a cantina choreographed by sword  stunt legend ralph faulkner  who makes a rare screen appearance as the evil rodriguez . this was the first serial i ever saw  on matine at the bijou when i was a kid and i have been hooked on them ever since .  br    br   zorro  s fighting legion delivers  z  goods   ,1
fantastic documentary of     . this early   th century geography of today  s iraq was powerful . watch this and tell me if cecil b . demille didn  t take notes before making his the ten commandments . merian c . cooper  the photographer  later created cinerama  an idea that probably hatched while filming the remarkable landscapes in this film . fans of werner herzog will find this film to be a treasure  with heartbreaking tales of struggle  complimented by the land around them  never has the human capacity to endure been so evident . the fact that this was made when it was shows not only the will of the subjects  but of the filmmakers themselves .  ,1
this movie is the first of miikes triad society trilogy  and the trilogy kicks of to a great start . the movies in the trilogy are only connected thematically  and these themes are actually apparent in all his films  if you look close enough . shinjuku triad society is about a cop trying to prevent his kid brother from getting too involved with a rather extreme gang of outsiders  struggling their way to the top of tokyos yakuza . the kid brother is a lawyer  and the triad gang is becoming increasingly in need of one  as the movie progresses . the movie takes place in a very harsh environment  and is therefore pretty violent and tough . miike has done worse  but since this is a serious movie it hits you very hard . as usual there is also a lot of perverted sex  mostly homosexual in this one . the movie is in many ways a typical gangster movie  but with a great drive and true grittiness . if you  ve only seen miikes far  out movies  ichi the killer  fudoh etc .  this is worth checking out since it is sort of a compromise between his aggressive over  the  top style displayed in those movies and his more serious side  as seen in the other films of the trilogy . and as always with miike  there are at least two scenes in this that you  ll never forget  see it and figure out which ones for yourself  .  br    br        ,1
preminger  s adaptation of g . b . shaw  s   saint joan    screenplay by graham greene  received one of the worst critical reactions in it  s day . it was vilified by the pseudo  elite  the purists and the audiences was unresponsive to a film that lacked the piety and glamour expected of a historical pageant . as in   peeping tom    the reaction was malicious and unjustified . preminger  s adaptation of shaw  s intellectual exploration of the effects and actions surrounding joan of arc  her actual name in her own language is jeanne d  arc but this film is in english  is totally faithful to the spirit of the original play  not only on the literal emotional level but formally too . his film is a brechtian examination of the functioning of institutions  the division within and without of various factions all wanting to seize power . as such we are not allowed to identify on an emotional level with any of the characters  including joan herself .  br    br   as played by jean seberg  whose subsequent life offers a eerie parallel to her role here   she is presented as an innocent  a figure of purity whose very actions and presence reveals the corruption and emptiness in everyone . as such seberg plays her as both saint and madwoman . her own lack of experience as an actress when she made this film  which does show up in spots  conveys the freshness and youth of jeanne revealing both the fact that jeanne la pucelle is a humble illiterate peasant girl who strode out to protect her village and her natural intelligence . by no means did she deserve the harsh criticism that she got on the film  s first release  it  s a performance far beyond the ken and call of any first  time actress with no prior acting experience . shaw and preminger took a secular view towards joan seeing her as a medieval era feminist  not content with being a rustic daughter who  s fate is to be married away or a whore picked up by soldiers to and away from battlefields . her faith  her voices  her visions which she intermingles with words such as  imagination  and  common sense  leads her to wear the armour of her fellow soldiers to lead them to battle to chase the invading englishman out of france .  br    br   and yet it can be said that the film is more interested in the court of the dauphin  richard widmark   the office of the clergy who try joan led by pierre cauchon  anton walbrook  impeccably cast  and the actions of the earl of warwick  john gielgud  then in joan herself . the superb ensemble cast  all male  portray figures of scheming  machievellian  although the story precedes niccolo  opportunists who treat religion as a childish toy to be used and manipulated for their own ends . the sharp sardonic dialogue gives the actors great fun to let loose . john gielgud as the eminently rational earl whose intelligence   albeit accompanied by corruption   allows him to calculate the precise manner in which he can ensure joan gets burnt at the stake and anton walbrook  s pierre cauchon brings a three dimensional portrait to this intelligent theologian who will give joan the fair trial that will certainly find her guilty . richard widmark as the dauphin is a real revelation . as against  type a casting choice you  ll ever find  widmark portrays the weak future ruler of france in a frenzied  comic caricature that  s as close as this film comes to comic relief . a comic performance that feels like an imitation of jerry lewis far more than an impetuous future ruler of france .  br    br   preminger shot   saint joan   in black and white  the cinematographer is georges perinal who worked with rene clair and who did   the life and death of colonel blimp   in colour . it  s perfectly restrained to emphasize the rational intellectual atmosphere for this film . preminger  s preference for tracking shots of long uninterrupted takes is key to the effectiveness of the film  there  s no sense of a wasted movement anywhere in his mise  en  scene .  br    br   it also marks the direction of preminger  s most mature  and most neglected period  his focus is on the conflict between individuals and the institutions in which they work  how the institution function and how the individual acts as per his principles . these themes get their most direct treatment in his film and as always he keeps things unpredictable and finds no black and white answers . this is one of his very best and most effective films .  ,1
the name of this film alone made me want to see just what it was all about  so i taped this film during the early hours of the am . if you ever wanted to see what miners had to go through during the early days and actually see a dramatic scene when the mine crumbles in on the men . this film clearly wants to show that germany and france can work together and be friends after ww i and how the germans came to the aid of the french miners much to the unbelief of the french townsfolk . the actors were all outstanding  with unusual scenes in the mine with a horse and a small young boy who worked in the mine . there is an old old retired miner who manges to go down the mine by ladder when the elevator breaks down . if you are a real film buff  this is a film you will not want to miss .  ,1

this movie was bizarre  completely inexplicable  and hysterical to watch with friends while drinking in a big empty house . i really love the opening stuff with lisa wandering about lost in a gorgeous city . i want to be a beautiful stranger lost in some exotic european locale  though maybe not in a low budget horror flick . definitely get the ending where there are the strangely non  sexual sex scenes that were cut out  in my dvd copy anyway  . don  t attempt to understand it  just go along and watch out for the weird bits . . . which is everything . don  t watch this if you actually want plot or characterization or anything at all to make sense . pretty beautiful  though you may just give up on this and decide to watch an actual horror movie  like say  dead alive .  ,0
this is another one of those  humans vs insects  eco  horror  features a theme that was popular in the late    s . only you can  t really call it horror . there  s zero suspense and no gruesome events . in other words this movie is pretty lame . it  s not that it  s really bad or something it  s just very boring . a construction site near a hotel uncovers a big nest of ants . later on we learn that  probably due to different sorts of pesticides used in the past  their bite became poisonous . some people get bitten and rushed to the hospital and it takes ages for the residents of the hospital to figure out what  s going on . robert foxworth figures it out first and then you can see him go berserk with a digging machine for what seems like several hours . then they flee in the house  waiting to get rescued . and  man  you should see all the efforts they make for rescuing them . i won  t spoil too much  but at one point they even use a big helicopter . all the time when i was watching this  i sat there thinking  come on  people  you all got shoes on . just run out of the building . i  m sure a bunch of ants won  t catch up with you .  it  s all pretty ridiculous .  br    br   of course  lots of close  ups of crawling ants are shown throughout the whole movie . ants in the garden . ants in the garbage . ants in the kitchen . ants on the roof . ants in the bedroom . ants in the sink . and the best part ants crawling on people  s faces while the actors are breathing through straws . but when you see groups of ants in wider shots  they indeed look like black rice the set designers glued to the wall .  br    br   one small surprise came near the end . no  it has nothing to do with a twist in the plot . it was just that brian dennehy made an appearance as a chief  fireman . ehrr . . . what more can i say  this movie is called it happened at lakewood manor but the box  art of my copy read ants and the title during the opening credits was panic at lakewood manor . there you have it . now  since this is a made  for  tv movie from the    s  i  ll be once again extremely mild in my final rating . now  the savage bees  another  humans vs insects  tv  movie from     was much better than this one . i even feel i have to go back and add a few points to its rating after having seen ants . lacking suspense  action  thrills  shocks and creepiness  the only thing you  ll be left with after seeing ants is an annoying itch .  ,0
this show is beautifully done . when it first came out i though it nothing more than a light  hearted family comedy with quite a few good one  liners . it seemed to express many families really well too  with different concepts of both parent and child  however  like i said  i never thought any more of it then a good watch on an evening . however  my view was shot out the other window when the tragic death of the fantastically funny john ritter accrued . the programme stood it  s ground and really commended the characters life in a very sensitive way that also touched the hearts of all the admire res of john ritter  a fantastic actor with the talent to do anything . when the show aired after ritters passing  i really wanted to just give my dad a hug and let him know how much he meant to me . i thought this shone threw the acting talents of the three children  particularly that of bridget  s character  who was worried of the last words she said to him . it reminded me that no matter what horrible things i say to my dad  i don  t mean them and it  s very important that he knows this . great show  ,1
i read rice  s novel with interest  and became quite enchanted with its characters and heartbreaking tale based on historical truths .  br    br   however  i was simply appalled at this disastrous adaptation . the casting was based merely on physical appearance  and not acting talent  with the obvious exception of peter gallagher  who was neither blond  haired  or able to act his way out of a wet paper bag  . the cast  s embarrassingly clumsy and inconsistent attempts at affecting a french accent was hilarious  but not in an entertaining way . i found myself wincing through this muddled and melodramatic tripe  and was surprised i made it to the end .  br    br   a warning to fans of the novel  stay away from this one .  ,0
this is an amazing movie and all of the actors and actresses and very good  even though some of the actors and actresses weren  t very popular in show business it seemed like they have been acting since they were  one year old  it was funny  gross and just all out a very good movie . in most parts i just didn  t know what was going to happen next  i was like i think this is going to happen  wait i think this is going to happen . all age groups will love this movie  in some parts i couldn  t stop laughing  it was so funny  but in some parts i was totally grossed out and i couldn  t believe what i was seeing  i am definitely going to see this movie again  it is one of those movies where it can  t get boring . every time you see it is so suspenseful . i definitely recommend seeing this movie    ,1

i watched this show and i simply didn  t find it funny at all . it might have been the first episode . lately i realize abc is playing a lot of stupid shows nowadays and is going down as a station . all the characters on this show are pretty bad actors  but even if they were good the jokes and script are pretty horrible and would still bring the show down . i would say that i believe this show will be cancelled  but seeing as how abc is doing pretty horrible for quality of shows they are playing  they might just keep this one simply because it  s average compared to them .  ,0
one of the more  literate  lone stars  with time spent on character development and interaction  dialog and acting business . the opening scene sets the stage  literally  for the personalities of the gambler  kansas charlie  eddy chandler   and his buddy  john scott  john wayne  the rodeo  say roh  day  oh  star  both of whom are slightly randy . the film follows their adventures  as they try to best each other in the pursuit of the mexican juanita  and later in their pursuit of perky mary kornman  who has the inevitable evil brother  though he  d been led astray by the real villain  and wants to repent  . and oh  of course  they  re being wrongly accused of two crimes and have to serve jail time before escaping and being exonerated at the end .  br    br   the high point is scott continually and deliberately ogling mary  s butt in her grocery store  and knocking away the ladder she  s standing on so he can catch her and grab her as she falls . it all seems a little contemporary for a   s western  but it sounds better than it actually is .  br    br   sadly  the exciting action elements we find in many other lone stars are sorely missing here . no yakima canutt . cheap and bad uses of stock footage of riders falling off horses . no george hayes . tedious stooge  like bi  play between scott and charlie  with charlie swinging at scott  scott stomping on his foot and then punching him  repeated two more times   . the skilled paul fix is underused . eddy chandler himself  here in his big star turn  is not really believable as a randy side kick . the villain looks too old and fat . so does chandler  who spent his later career in    more movies as an uncredited meatloaf . mary kornman  of the twenties  our gang   see  mary  queen of tots       is cute in her scenes with john wayne  but that  s about it for this one . seeds of a better western lie buried here .  br    br   p . s . the ultra  short colorized version  which looks good  moves along so fast  it  s over if you blink more than once . thankfully though  the embarrassing scenes with eddy chandler have been cut .  ,0

december holiday specials  like the original frosty  ought to be richly  produced with quality music and a wholesome  yet lighthearted storyline . they should have a touch of the mystical magic of the holidays . basically  they should look  sound  and feel . . . well   special  and they should have a decent and appropriate december holiday subtext .  br    br   so when i saw legend of frosty the snowman in the tv listings  i got my kids   and   pumped up for it by telling them the story of the original frosty and passionately relating how much i enjoyed it as a kid . as my wife and kids cozied up on the couch to watch the movie the expectations were high  but   minutes into it my kids were yawning and my wife and i were giving each other  the look  and rolling our eyes . after   minutes my kids were actually asking to go to bed   i guess they were fed up with the insensitive language and pointless  disconnected segments . i was actually embarrassed about their  and my  disappointment with this movie .  br    br   unfortunately  legend of frosty the snowman is more like a bad episode of fairly odd parents crossed with a worse  than  normal episode of sponge bob than a classic holiday movie . don  t get me wrong . . . those shows are fine and i like them as much as the next guy  but when i watch fairly odd parents or sponge bob  my low expectations  for mediocre  off  color  zero subtext  mind numbing episodes  are always satisfied .  br    br   we picked out some good books and spent the rest of the evening reading together . a much better choice than the embarrassingly bad legend of frosty the snowman .  ,0

an underrated addition to the graham greene cinematic canon  its perceived faults can now be seen as virtues . director shumlin  theatrical director  frames his action with an oppressive rigidity appropriate to the material  and the seemingly inept compositions compellingly suggest unease . both a dark thriller and a story of moral regeneration  for the female character  in a   s thriller    the film has an upright hero who turns mad and murderous  and possibly paedophiliac   brilliantly brings the faraway ideologies of the spanish civil war into jolting dangerous reality  has one horrific murder  an astonishing insights into class and capitalism  clever theatrical metaphors  a rare approximation of greene  s god  and an ending that is only happy if you know nothing about history .  ,1

panahi  whose previous films such as the circle and crimson gold have seemed to range from dour to grim  has produced in his new offside a funny  obstreperous  joyously chaotic ensemble piece that ends on a note of liberation and heartfelt fun  yet the movie deals with material quite as challenging and relevant as anything else he  s done . by focusing on a group of ardent girl soccer fans caught sneaking into the pre  world cup bahrain  iran match in tehran stadium  panahi brings up issues of national spirit and independent  mindedness  and the contradictions  and sheer absurdity  of the regime  s religious gender apartheid in a world of modern competition with a majority youth population and urban girls who increasingly think for themselves .  br    br   as the film opens we breathlessly join one of the girls in a bus  with a father pursing a lost daughter . this one has a disguise and has national colors as warpaint  but we cringe with her in the knowledge of what  s going to happen she  s still easily spotted . the thing is  most of the men around don  t really care . still  rules are rules  and once they try to make it through the various checkpoints on the way into the big stadium the would  be soccer girls  or some of them anyway  get rounded up and held in a little compound upstairs in the stadium by some mostly young  green  and rustic soldier  cops who have no idea how to deal with these big city girls  independent ideas and would rather be watching the game  whose roar we constantly hear in the background  themselves . each girl is different  represents a different set of reasons for wanting to break the rules and different ways of doing it . one wore a soldier  s uniform and got into the officers  section . one is tough and masculine and mocking and provocative  she could pass for a pretty boy  and teasingly hints at that  are you a girl or a boy    which would you like me to be    . one doesn  t care very much about soccer but went to honor a dead comrade . one  aida sadeghi  is an ardent soccer player herself  and so on . these tehrani girls are stubborn and smart and they walk all over the uptight rural lieutenant in charge of them  safar samandar  . one of the rural cops  mohamad kheirabadi  takes the girl soccer player to the men  s restroom  of course there  s no ladies    forcing her to wear a poster of an italian football star as a mask . a comedy of errors and chaos follows in which the girl escapes .  br    br   later a spiffy looking van comes with an officer who directs the cops to take the girls to the vice department  violating sexual segregation rules qualifies as vice . a male gets mixed in with them  a kid who  s chronically guilty of smuggling fireworks into the games . the van turns out not to be so spiffy the radio aerial is broken . but one cop holds it in place so they can listen to the increasingly heart  stopping reportage . cops and prisoners are all joined in a common excitement now . there  s no score  the game goes to penalty kicks  and the winner will go to germany .  br    br   in the background through all this is a real game  a real stadium  and real masses of young men crazy about the outcome of this event . the excitement is tremendous  and the streets are jammed with cars and flags and a milling mob of supporters praying for an iranian win and united in their excitement .  br    br   what makes this film so good  as may be clear by now  is that it  s shot during the evening of an actual game with a real finale that turns everything around . this  in contrast to panahi  s previous highly calculated narrative trajectories  is spontaneous vrit film  making that improvises in rhythm with a captured background of actual events and sweeps you into its excitement in ways that are quite thrilling .  br    br   the essence of offside is the disconnect between modern world soccer madness and retro  islamic social prohibitions repressing women  the latter existing at a time when young iranian women are becoming part of a global world in which females participate in sport and share in the ardor of national team spirit . how exactly do you reconcile the country  s ambition to become a modern global power with social attitudes that are medieval  a lot of offisde is astonishingly real  including the way everybody tries to talk their way out of everything . the director  s decision to inject young actors into an actual sports mega  event leads to a stunningly effective blend of documentary  polemic  and fiction that is too energetic to seem to have a bone to pick  and that ends in a way that  s brilliant and moving .  br    br   i  ve had reservations about panahi  s films before  but this one kicks ass . panahi does something remarkable here . he critiques his society  presents an unusual drama  and touches our hearts with a sense of a nation  s aspirations .  ,1
this piece of filth is virtually impossible to follow . the sound is crap the picture quality goes from bad to worse to good to bad again  things happen for no apparent reason characters appear and disappear . was the director suffering from a massive brain injury during its production   br    br   poor film making aside  the story is vile just sick evil sht if you like rape  murder and self harm this is right up your alley . and if simulated scenes of murder are not enough you can enjoy clips of actual people being executed . i watched almost all of it but had to turn off after i seen someones brains blown out . never before have i seen a film that left me feeling so ashamed and dirty .  ,0
first off  i must admit that both films i  ve seen by this director i saw without titles and so may have missed the points . my czech isn  t bad but  having sat through two of his films  i wish i hadn  t even tried to learn . samotari is too cool . way too cool . it  s about ten different story lines that weave in and out together . that  s not so deeply unusual in a town the size of prague  tiny  really .  the main characters are between   and   . they  ve got jobs and only one studies . the best character is the young balkan girl . her sentiments are echoed by immigrants here every damn day . that  s about it . the only great character . everyone else is making their own lives hell quite on their own . how can i sympathise with such obvious incompetence  perhaps there are interesting bits with japanese tourists but do i need another stereotype in film  if you like alright music  see this film . if you want to laugh at others  stupidity  see this film . if you like irony and dry humor  see an original jarmusch not an imitation . and under no circumstances see ondricek  s film  septej  whisper .  that is unless you enjoy homophobic stereotypes .  ,0

so i  m looking to rent a dvd and i come across this movie called  end game  . it stars james woods and cuba gooding jr and has the synopsis of a taught political thriller . well worth a look then . or so i thought .  br    br   boy  was i wrong .  br    br   end game has just about the most ridiculous plot i have ever had the displeasure of enduring . now being something of a whodunnit  i can  t really tear into it as i would like without  ruining  it for those who have yet to experience this monstrosity . but questions such as  why has he  she  they done this    and  where on earth did they get the resources to pull this off   are all too abundant following the film  s unintentionally hilarious conclusion .  br    br   as for the acting  you know those films where you can almost feel that an actor  s realised that they  ve made a terrible mistake in signing on for a movie  and this then shows in their performance  this is one of those . accompany this with a laughable script and seriously flawed  irritating direction and you have the recipe for cinematic poison .  br    br   of course  this didn  t make it to the cinema  and for the same reason you should not allow it into your living room it is appalling .  ,0
james stewart stars in a classic western tale of revenge which ties in with the fate of the films other star the winchester rifle . stewart is it goes without saying excellent adding some cold hard obsession to his usual laid back cowboy . the story follows the fate of a winchester rifle and its owners after being won in a competition by our hero and stolen by the man he is hunting .  br    br   we meet a selection of gamblers  gun fighters  indian traders and bank robers as we follow the rifles path through indian battles  bank heists etc . the supporting cast are all solid with dan durya standing out as waco johnny dean the live  wire gunfighter with an itchy trigger finger . also as a trivia note a very early appearance from rock hudson as an indian chief .  br    br   the end showdown is a classic a tense rifle battle fought at long range in and around a rocky outcrop . throw in some good old western action  fist fights  shootouts and horseback chases it makes for a rollicking western adventure .      ,1
waldemar daninsky  paul naschy  travels to tibet and is bitten by a yeti  which causes him to become a werewolf . he is accidentally killed after he attacks his cheating wife and her lover  and is later revived by a female scientist  dr . ilona ermann  who uses him in mind control experiments . daninsky later discovers an underground asylum populated by the bizarre subjects of the doctor  s failed experiments .  br    br   upon hearing of naschy  s death from colleague jon kitley  i rummaged through my collection for a suitable film to watch . in my scramble  i found i own not one but three    copies of  fury of the wolfman  . the film is of questionable video quality  the sound is dubbed in a mediocre fashion  the cinematography is sort of slapstick style at times . and the american versions have two love scenes removed . quite frankly  without a remastered  uncut copy  i wasn  t really getting the proper movie in all its glory .  br    br   this film claims to be the fourth in a long series about the werewolf count waldemar daninsky . i suspect this is true  but you wouldn  t know this from the film itself . the plot is confusing at times  and there  s really no indication that this is a sequel . if you read the plot summaries on wikipedia and compare them to what is printed on the box  you  ll see that i  m not alone in my confusion .  br    br   perhaps the film  s shortcomings can be forgiven if we understand the production hell it went through . while floating around for years  it was only released in      due to problems involved in finding a distributor . and naschy said in his autobiography that the director  zabalza  was an incompetent alcoholic  and that he hated working with him . those really aren  t light accusations  and i have no idea what zabalza had to say on his own behalf .  br    br   chances are  sooner or later you  ll come across a low  grade version of  fury of the wolfman  . it appears in a variety of three  packs and box sets  so you might accidentally acquire it and not even know . what really needs to happen is an american uncut version  with a decent sound and video mix  and the love scenes thrown back in . as far as i know  this does not exist . let us honor paul naschy  s legacy and get his films to a wider audience in a level of quality he deserves .  ,0
this movie isn  t about football at all . it  s about jesus  god   it  s the same kind of sappy sanctimonious religious drivel you get from those arch idiots who wrestle for jesus  or pump iron for jesus . yeah  jesus was totally buffed  liked contact sports  and definitely owned a full set of dumb bells . duhhh  this movie should have been entitled  hiking for jesus   or something along those lines just to let the general public know that the real intent of this movie is to convert people to christianity  and to pander to those whose brains have already been thoroughly washed in the blood of the lamb . that the title is derived from the bible is made clear when the head coach is reading his bible and asking jesus for help . the recent sports movie  invincible  was    times more inspiring than this was  and jesus wasn  t even a factor . it was just the desire and determination of an individual with a dream .  br    br   any broad appeal as an inspirational sports movie is ultimately lost amidst all of the blatant bible thumping and sanctimonious religious propaganda . one gets the impression that the sole message is the only way you can succeed and make positive gain is if you accept jesus as your personal savior . but this is simply not true  and is therefore a lie being perpetuated by those who believe that it is true and want everyone else to believe it . the image of the winning athlete thanking jesus when he wins comes directly to mind . what does he do when he loses  does he curse jesus  of course not  when he loses jesus isn  t responsible . jesus is only responsible when he wins . and the logic goes round and round and round  and it ends up exactly where the true believer needs it to be  every time   i had to hit pause when the scene with the coach receiving a brand new truck came on so i could stop rolling on the floor laughing my ass off and catch my breath . materialism is not what jesus taught . i find it odd that most so called  christians  seem to either forget or ignore this message from their  savior   especially when i see a jesus fish on the back of a huge gas guzzling suv that passes me like i  m standing still .  br    br   another message this movie implies is that jesus apparently cares more about the win loss record of a mediocre high school football team that he does about the millions of starving children in the world . the final scene where the insecure and unsure kicker boots a   yard field goal and it is hyped up as an unbelievably incredible miracle puts the final gag me with a spoon religious red flag on this turkey . i only gave it three stars because the guy who played the black coach could actually act .  ,0

well  one has to give the director credit for how gutsy he was . gutsy would be the right term . not only did he use a total cast of five people  no extras at all   but he also decided to use sub  par special effects with a confusing and boring plot  he also  and i am not kidding  put a warning at the beginning of the movie that you might die of fright    however  they do promise a freeeeee coooofffffffiiiiinnnnn . to have a creepy limping gardener is always a good move . yaaa  unique  aaawwwwnnn . . . .  br    br   if you watch mystery science theater      you might  ve seen this . they like to showcase horrible movies  just to let you know .  br    br   a good gift for someone you hate .  ,0
penny princess finds american working girl yolande donlon the inheritor of a small kingdom that lies in that triangle where france  italy  and switzerland meet called lampidorra . it seems as though the lampidorrans owe bills all over europe and the main occupation of the country is smuggling due to its geography . an american multi  millionaire buys the place  but dies before he can take title . his nearest heir is donlan .  br    br   but of course the estate has to go through probate in america and what are the lampidorrans to do  especially since donlan who has now become a princess has forbade smuggling .  br    br   enter dirk bogarde who is on a trip to switzerland to learn about the cheese industry . it seems as though the lampidorrans have a kind of cheese that they playfully refer to as schmeeze . with a few bumps in the road  schmeeze solves all the problems both financial  geopolitical  and romantic between donlan and bogarde .  br    br   how does schmeeze work  well that  s the gimmick to the whole film . but here  s a hint . in lover come back jack kruschen might just have gotten a hold of the secret of schmeeze when he was busy inventing vip for rock hudson and his advertising agency .  br    br   anyway penny princess is a delightful blend of british farce and romantic comedy . yolande donlon once again plays a role that marilyn monroe would have been cast in if the film had been made this side of the pond . dirk bogarde was well cast in the part which was at the beginning of his career as a romantic heart throb  way before anyone but him suspected he had the acting chops he had .  br    br   this film was sadly shown at three o  clock in the morning on tcm . but at least i found a reason to be grateful for insomnia .  ,1
the only explanation i can muster as to why this film isn  t widely distributed is because it hits too close to home for some . this movie was a genuine happy surprise  the satire is genius . this film turns the lights on in the dark that is organized religion and big media  and the roaches scurry for cover . rent the dvd and watch it for yourself if you haven  t yet  this film succeeds where many have failed  dogma comes to mind  to poke it  s nose under the tent  both by using humor and very clever analogies coupled with telling backdrops and locations . can  t comment in depth without revealing some significant spoilers  there are some surprises in this film which even the seasoned film buff will be caught off guard by .  ,1
big s isn  t playing with taboos or forcing an agenda like  say mencia or chapelle  though i like them both  . she states the obvious in subtle  near subliminal remarks . her show won  t change the world  nor is it meant to . but  along with the hilarious brian posehn and paget brewster  s ex  boyfriend jay johnston of  mr . show  fame  this is one mean show with an appetite for destruction  my side  s were thoroughly wrecked by the first episode . look  i love this woman and like her famed boyfriend  jimmy kimmel  she just delivers the lines and lets the viewer run  with  it . the best kind of comedy around . spoofing anything and anyone  like  mary poppins  in the second episode when she sings to the fake birds on to quick hitting commentary on society and college aged existential nonsense . this one is highly recommended  but only for those who still have a funny bone  and didn  t lose it in their most recent lippo  suction treatment or boob job  .  ,1
what we have here is a classic case of too much patriotism . this is what happens when you live in a small country with very little  next to none  even  cinema history . whenever somebody does come up with a slightly more ambitious film project  other than the usual dramas about struggling farmer families or long feature slapstick movies of local comedians  everybody feels obliged to love it and even responsible to spread favorable reviews across the countries  borders . this is especially the case when the writer  director of this particular film is already a nation  s sweetheart  because he  s also the founder and lead singer of a popular rock band .  any way the wind blows  is by no means a bad film  but it  s definitely overrated  if that is even possible within the boundaries of a small country  and has absolutely nothing new or even remotely original to offer . this is basically the flemish version of classic movies such as  short cuts  and  magnolia  and illustrates a mosaic of characters whose daily lives initially appear to be unrelated but eventually come together in the end . the only thing that seems to unite the eight protagonists at first is the city of antwerp  where they all live and work  but gradually the deeper relationships between them become transparent and near the climax they all gather for a party . the main problem with  any way the wind blows   at least according to yours truly  lies with the characters . they really are random  uninteresting and honestly don  t experience anything that could be considered out of the ordinary . it was presumably writer  director tom barman  s intention to depict the average  regular inhabitant of antwerp but then  seriously  what is the point  one of the characters gets fired from his film projectionist job  another one is a failed novelist struggling with a marriage crisis  two siblings recently lost their father and the most  mysterious  one of them all is followed by the wind wherever he goes . there are a couple of more characters regularly walking through the screen  but they  re even less worth mentioning . these people simply drivel on and on about very random topics  like life in the    s  dates and each other  s bowel motions  and philosophy about matters nobody cares about . some of the dialogs do evoke mild chuckles  especially the interactions between the two twenty  something guys from ghent  but still nothing extraordinary or even memorable . the film actually works best as a touristy video to promote the city of antwerp and as an extended  versatile music documentary . there are several stylish  nifty sightseeing images of antwerp and there  s always beautiful music playing  whether really loud or subtly in the background . generally speaking  any way the wind blows  is a competently made and stylish effort  but too mundane and slightly boring  and i honestly wonder most of its fans would even had bothered to watch if it weren  t a flemish production .  ,0
the social commentary was way overblown and the mystery itself is built and solved through a series of implausible coincidences that were entirely unbelievable . nothing has changed in fitz  s personal life in the past decade that makes it remotely interesting .  br    br   i even had trouble understanding why he was complaining about his stay in australia as compared to the opportunities to solve mysteries that he has in england . can he not insinuate himself on the australian police  it seems like a very artificial plot point to get him involved in a crime investigation .  br    br   the latter episodes of the original series were pretty melodramatic and implausible  sometimes bordering on silliness  and this one picks up that mantle rather than returning to the focus of series one . sad .  ,0

even duller  if possible  than the original  i hope i may say that under the imdb guidelines  . the french connection at least tried to absorb european influences  to complicate the conventional view of the american police detective  even if the attempt was foundered by friedkin  s ambivalence  americaness and general indirection . the  relative  arthouse boom of the     s  especially with the nouvelle vague  allowed for a huge influence of european cinema in hollywood . this lent a new vigour and complexity to a weary medium  and  in the best of them  eg bonnie and clyde  early scorcese   a new subversion of received practice . the original connection was part of this movement  with its difficultly distanced style  and anti  detective figure . two is old hollywood  s right  wing reassertion of american values .  br    br   this is figured in the film  s very tiresome america vs france dialectic . for instance  two is shot like a   s french policier . it was the french  of course  who insisted on the greatness of american movies when they were ignored at home  and this  in a sense  is a reclamation  a warning against gallic presumption . this can be seen in the pattern of the two movies . connection has french gangsters invading new york  with the french style smothering the american thriller  this leads to the dissolution of the detective figure  and irresolution of plot  the baddie got away .  br    br   two has the american returning to france  with american thriller values imposed on the native genre  the power of the detective is reasserted and conventional resolution is achieved . this is further dramatised in doyle  s relationship with french inspector barthelmy  whose dominant influence he must shake off before he can control the plot .  br    br   two seems to follow the original by undermining its detective hero . from the start  doyle  s importance is diminished at every turn . despite the ending of connection  he is considered a hero . but he is an american in a foreign land  and his inability to control language or customs means he cannot dominate the plot . he even misreads the signs of the police force  mistaking an informer for a criminal  and getting him killed .  br    br   a detective  s power comes from his power as subject to see and interpret  but doyle spends much of the movie being watched  controlled  an object  a body  literally in the scenes after he is dumped by charnier  to be viewed and interpreted . in connection  he instigated the action  chasing the criminals  forcing the plot here he is passive  tied to a bed  locked in a cell  an addict  a dependent .  br    br   this loss of phallic power is predictably symbolised in the loss of his gun  and the film follows a depressingly familiar oedipal trajectory . in the heroin sequences  he is comforted by an old lady who says he looks like her son . his drugged state is like a return to the womb  robbed of adult pressures . her taking his watch reinforces the timelessness of this state  doubly significant for a man whose career depends on timetables and precision .  br    br   oedipus was the first detective  and to avoid his fate  doyle must reject this false mother who is dissolving his unified identity  and kill the father  charnier  so that he can take his accepted masculine role in society . psychoanalytic theory was popular among academics in the   s  ironically instigated by a frenchman  jacques lacan   but it  s rare to see a film so literally full of it .  br    br   if all of these facts tended towards the minimising of doyle  then the film  s style doesn  t . friedkin distanced us from his hero by refusing empathy or character motivation  focusing on the mechanics of plot . here  doyle is a very conventional hollywood hero . instead of being lost in murky long shot  he is made knowable and understandable to the viewer with the traditional devices  point  of  view shots  close ups  connecting shots etc .  br    br   two is all about the fall and rise of popeye doyle . plot in this case is subservient to the acting  which is the usual hackman showiness . the cold turkey scenes  therefore  despite their tediousness  are not disturbing . we are allowed to share rather than coldly observe this a far less discomforting experience . the scenes are also shot through with a lachrymose manly sentimentality that is very american .  br    br   so while connection tried to imitate the complex thrillers of jean pierre melville  two does the complete opposite . melville  s le samourai featured a gangster who started the film whole  powerful  outside language  and charted his eventual disintegration . two starts with a disintegrated character  achieved partly through inability with language  whose dominance begins when he steps outside language  the concluding action sequences are largely wordless .  br    br   in the film  the locale and language are important as they fixed and undermined the detective  but as he regains his power  figured in the return of his gun  and the cathartic burning of the primal site of vulnerability  the tower block where charnier held him   the marseilles setting becomes more irrelevant  and the mythic stand  off  which could take place anywhere  takes over . compare the endings of the two films one admits ambiguity and despair  the other absolute certainty .  br    br    ,0
i noticed that this film has taken the brunt of a lot of insults . it probably earned some of them  but it wasn  t that bad . well  i  ll be honest i never want to see this film again . it was a bad film . but i don  t hate this film  it tried to tell a story . as a drama  this film could work very well actually . i just think the filmmakers misgauged which road to take when they made this  they should have added more funny bits if they wanted it to be a comedy  . with a rewrite  it could have been a great film . but as a satire  it didn  t work in its current form   many scenes did not fit within the context of the plot for example  the robbery scene makes little sense in the story . still  it wasn  t the worst independent film ever made   is it in the top   worst  that  s debatable .  ,0
i  m probably one of the biggest nancy drew fans out there . i  ve read every book three times over and i  ve played a lot of the nancy drew games . i loved this movie . it kept you entertained the whole time you watched it . i went with about   of my friends and everyone loved it . there were three woman sitting behind us who appeared to be in their late    s to early    s and i asked them how they liked it  they said they loved it  so you see it will be an entertainment to all ages . you just have to give it a chance . and it teaches a lesson too  just be yourself even if everyone around you is exactly alike . so overall  this move was great . i  m going to see it a second time now  so stop bashing it please . its a really good movie   ,1
this movie surprised me . some things were  clicheish  and some technological elements reminded me of the movie  enemy of the state  starring will smith . but for the most part very entertaining  good mix with jamie foxx and comedian mike epps and the  wannabe thugs julio and ramundo  providing some comic relief  . this is a movie you can watch over again  say . . . some wednesday night when nothing else is on . i gave it a  for entertainment value .  ,1
i thought it was not the best re  cap episode i  ve every seen  though my viewing partner handed me a tissue in anticipation of the brendan fraser moment . . . sigh  . it was nice to see cox outside of the incessantly brittle  coxism state  he is in these days  if only for brief moments . i also enjoyed trying to place the episodes included by the length of the character  s hair  or height  in case of jd  and the youthfulness of the earliest episodes . i can also see how zach might be well on the way to a very chevy chase  or is that matthew perry  prat  fall induced chemical slide  already acknowledged on conan  . a little side note  the song  now stuck in my head  from the janitor  induced dance montage was  diner  by martin sexton .  ,0
i lived during those times and i think the program caught the heart of the era . i do think it should have dealt with more of the afro american issue but i think it cover a lot in the program . it was scary to sit and watch the riots on t v hoping that they would not go as far as your families home and that it would not get burnt down . i thought jerry o  connell did a great job portraying a vet coming back from the war . i went to school with guys who came back . some had changed more than others and some not so much . it bothers me when someone comments that an issue was not covered enough or it was not entertaining enough . live through it and then make comments . i thought the movie was great and that everyone in it did a remarkable job . thank you for a trip  sad and good  down memory lane .  ,1
finally we get a tv series where we get to see the acting talent  episode one was excellent  the script gave us a little more than usual  yeah  there was still the  i  m not your father  i  m your father and omigod you cheated on me   rubbish but the script allowed the actors to actually feel and live those real moments rather than show us what it would feel like if  like so many tv soaps do .  br    br   the camera work also gave us a little more than usual  there were no boring shots of repeated angles for hours yet there was no unnecessary  shots inside shots or hand  held camera crap  to add an  artistic  edge it gave us what we needed to see and also some beautiful scenery pictures as well   br    br   nothing was over  dramatised or melodramatic they were real people in a real place dealing with real situations  the show lacked nothing in drama and was completely relevant . it was such a relief to be exposed to real acting and so nice to let our country see just how talented our actors can be when given a real script  a real opportunity  thank you tony tilse  sam miller  channel ten and all cast and crew  wonderful work   please continue what you are doing  your efforts are much appreciated and do not go unnoticed   ,1
i really thought that this movie was superb . not only is the history correct  but the style is sumptuous and yet intimate . i was a fan of emily blunt  s portrayal of victoria and how she kept her spirit even though she was forced into a virtual exile while in her youth . blunt depicts the charismatic and sometimes dogmatic manner that vicotria became famous  perhaps infamous  for . the romantic elements of the movie are so genuine and tender that by the end of the movie you genuinely understand why vicotria chose to live the rest of her days in mourning of albert .  br    br   the technical aspects of the film are worthy of note as well . i appreciated the beautiful score  which moves quite wonderfully along with the dramatic movement of the story . i also considered the cinematography to be outstanding  some scenes leaving me quite breathless because of the lushness and splendor they depict .  br    br   there have been so few movies this year as beautiful and tender as this film and it rates as one of      s best   ,1
sure  for it  s super imagery and awesome sound  it  s a great home theater  show off  disk  but this is also a touching drama as well as an informative documentary . the parallel stories that are intertwined throughout this film will keep all viewers interested . young  old  boys and girls alike will find that deep down  we are all fans of the automobile  especially the high performance indy machines that are the result of generations blood  sweat  tears  ingenuity and perseverance . the mark knopfler and ry cooder sound track is perfectly matched to the visuals and the content . i don  t want to give away the ending  but the final driving sequence to quincy jones   days like these  just might bring a tear to your eye . enjoy it   ,1
this movie is an awesome non  stop laugh riot incorporating all the usual ingredients of a dawid dhawan comedy  bumbling heroes  buffoonish supporting characters  made  up dolls for heroines  nasty villains  wisecracks  rocking soundtrack  choreography and a little dose of action .  br    br   amitabh bachchan and govinda both are in double roles of policemen and conmen . the heroine of amitabh the cop is ramya krishnan and raveena is opposite govinda the cop . heroines are mere rouge  smothered props as usual . the conmen have no heroines . paresh rawal carries his villainous act in daud forward  he played a similar don in khoobsurat too  . asrani shines in a brief role . he does a retake on his famous  angrezon ke zamaane ke jailer  act in sholay .  br    br   govinda is impeccable as usual  as a wisecracking  good  humoured policeman pyaare mohan and as a conman chhote miyaan . he imitates bihari style of hindi speaking with hilarious results . amitabh bachchan  believe it or not  pales in comparison with him . but still ab is fine . madhuri dixit does a cameo as herself in the song  makhna  . she dances like wind .  br    br   viju shah  s music is awesome . check out  kisi disco mein jaayen    makhna  and the title track .  br    br   do not go looking for any logic since it is a comedy and the screenplay is of convenience completely . just enjoy yourself .  ,1
i only hope that no classicists  ancient historians saw  cleopatra   or  if they did  that they took it as a laugh . the movie is horrendously inaccurate  more laughably  even  than  gladiator   which is at least a well  written script whose historical errors are articulate and correspond well to the story  . most blatant is octavius  caesar  s heir  in the senate before caesar  s assassination at the ripe old age of     br    br   besides this  the acting is mediocre . timothy dalton has more than a hint of james bond in him when he says   caesar . julius caesar .  billy zane is a laughably dense marc antony . and leonor varela tries her best to be the seductive pharaoh  who in real life was not good  looking at all  but comes off as unbelievable .  br    br   so this is a warning for all historians   this movie is not true to life   ,0
i  m really suprised this movie didn  t get a higher rating on imdb . it  s one of those movies that could easily get by someone  but for romantic comedy  moonstruck  is really in a class by itself . it  s setting and ethnic charm are things people seem to take for granted . the casting alone makes it a nearly perfect movie . few movies in the      s were as good as  moonstruck  and it  s funny too .  out of   ,1
i admired rob marshall for chicago  but memoirs of geisha turns out to be yet another failure of combing western and asian arts . overall  the scene is beautiful  but after restless emphasis on exoticism  oriented scenes some might just find himself fed up with them . the excessive cherry blossom was  frankly  overdone . it  s probably the cultural difference of perception here the ultimate beauty is not the showy type  as truly beautiful geisha would not be the over westernised pumpkin in the movie .  br    br   some other comments have rightly mentioned the biggest flaws . as a taiwanese  i have no doubt the actress are great . an actor  actress can play any kind of role when he  she can look like it . gong li is great  but the power of emotions that she showed in this movie had not been translated into japanese style . all i saw was a bittersweet and jealous chinese woman . michlle yeoh  one of my favourtie actress  did not even look like a japanese . some comment has mentioned the peculiar delicate  feminine characteristics of japanese women  with which i can  t agree more . these are so delicate that i assume not even all modern japanese actresses are eligible for the roles in geisha  let alone the two chinese and one malaysian actress who grew up in different cultures and probably did not know japanese culture that much .  br    br   geisha is a good shot for arousing the curiosity of american audiences . but it would be an insult for the movie itself and for art alike if the movie wins the oscar for best costume  best director or best picture .  ,0
this is the best version  so far  that you will see and the most true to the bronte work . dalton is a little tough to imagine as rochester who jane eyre declared  not handsome  . but his acting overcomes this and zelah clark  pretty as she is  is also a complete and believable jane eyre . this production is a lengthy watch but well worth it . nearly direct quotes from the book are in the script and if you want the very first true  romance  in literature  this is the way to see it . i own every copy of this movie and have read and re  read the original . the filming may seem a little dated now but there will never be another like this .  ,1
a group of hunters track down a werewolf  kill it  decapitate it and then sell the head to unethical dr . atwill  played by director  writer tim sullivan   who runs a private clinic specializing in corneal transplants . research chemist rich stevens  mark sawyer   whose eyes were destroyed when acid flew into his face during a lab explosion  is the unlucky recipient of the werewolf  s eyeballs . it takes awhile to get to the first full moon  so first we get a tender love story between rich and his compassionate  big  breasted nurse sondra gard  stephanie beaton  . sondra is so compassionate that she strips off her clothing and starts riding rich in bed before he even has a chance to remove his bandages  after a month in the hospital  rich returns home to icy wife rita  deborah huber   who promptly tells him  you look pretty ugly  before speeding off in her kia . our hero soon discovers that rita is not only a bitch  but an adulterous skank who  s been carrying on an affair with his supposed friend craig  lyndon johnson  . finally  the full moon rises and rich finds himself in a hairy predicament as he transforms into a  very silly looking  werewolf creature . predictable carnage ensues .  br    br   after ripping out craig  s throat on a beach  rich wakes up in the brush the next morning with his clothes tattered and vague recollections of the evening  s events . he makes friends with dwarf psychic  occult expert andros  kurt levi  and is hassled by both local author siodmak  jason clark  and lesbian  police  detective  in  a  pants  suit justine evers  tarri markel  . when rich confronts dr . atwill  the doctor sends his sadistic bald henchman kass  eric mestressat   who gets a kick out of dismembering corpses with a machete at the clinic  after him . with help from sondra  rich manages to escape . sondra takes him back to her place and basically rapes him on the couch during an overlong sex scene that lasts about five minutes . will rich be able to control his lycanthropy or find a cure for it before he claims more victims   br    br   shot on the cheap with a camcorder  this homemade werewolf flick has a somewhat unique premise with the eye transplant angle  but trots out clich after clich otherwise . the sets are sub porn level  the clinic scenes seem to have been filmed inside someone  s home or apartment . the wolf transformation scenes don  t even look as good as the time lapse photography used way back in the     s . instead  they employ ragged editing . throw some hair on the actor . cut . throw on some more on . cut . more fur . . . and fill his mouth full of white gunk he can spit out . cut . no need to worry about continuity  there  s no fade  no dissolve  nothing . it  s pretty sloppy . once fully transformed  the werewolf costume  designed by jeff leroy  who also edited and shot the movie  is pretty awful . it has red  glowing christmas bulb eyes  fur that looks like shag carpet and a plastic face that  s almost completely immobile . there are several times you can see the cameraman  s fingers in front of the camera lens  and does the moon really stay full five nights in a row  as far as the cast is concerned  they  re amateurish  but tolerable . and as far as b horror flicks are concerned  there are worse out there . this one is paced fairly well  is only   minutes long and does provide plenty of the red stuff during the attack scenes  as well as the aforementioned ta from ms . beaton .  br    br   it was produced by david s . sterling  camp blood   who was one of the first to ride the wave of digital video right when it was first starting to dominate the low  budget  independent horror genre scene back in the mid  late   s . many of his notoriously awful productions were released by brain damage films  a label to avoid like the plague for the most part . fx guy jeff leroy  who is listed as co  director here at imdb  but not in the film  s actual credits  and vinnie bilancio  who appears in a small role as one of the hunters  went on to make the much more fun and polished exploitation flick werewolf in a women  s prison in      which had a similar  looking creature on display  red glowing eyes and all  .  ,0

perhaps  one of the most important and enjoyable greek films i  ve seen in the last ten years . . excellent performances  especially yiannis zouganelis is great   well  written script and effective direction from a very special  for the greek very average standards  auteur . a film  obviously influenced by sam peckinpah  s straw dogs  that could be a masterpiece if it avoided some evident and exaggerative situations and symbolizations in the end . nevertheless  this is a movie which deserves our attention and belongs to that rare category of greek movies which should be watched outside greece . it  s a shame that in greece didn  t work commercially  in addition with other fake and cursory big productions like politiki kouzina . .  ,1
most folks might say that if one were to spend a saturday night watching a movie  you must be really bored . actually  i had just gotten back home from being out and turned on the tv and there it was   paulie  .  br    br   i had missed the opening credits  so i didn  t know the name of it but i saw that it had cheech marin in it  so i naturally thought i had tuned into  born in east l . a .  when i saw him talking to a talking parrot  i was ready to dismiss this as the kind of flop movie they show late in the night .  br    br   happy to say  it was better than that . as you know  if you don  t already paulie is lost and trying to get back to his original owner . seems it  s taken years to find her . what should be paulie  s advantage is actually a dis  advantage in ways . people come across a literate parrot and all they see is a way to make money or benefit themselves .  br    br   while cheech marin  s character  is  making money from him  he  s not mean to him . the dance sequences with the parrots are something kids will find cute  i found them amusing .  br    br   paulie  who  s naive   learns quickly that not all humans are nice people . especially the owner of an animal research lab . the man lies to him saying he  ll help him find his owner as long as he helps in his animal communications research . paulie is now stuck but decides to make a fool out of the man at a demonstration to others of paulie  s vocal ability .  br    br   throughout the film paulie  s telling his story to the facilities janitor who ends up freeing him  several other animals and finding the location of paulie  s owner . it  s a touching reunion .  br    br    out of    the wing clipping scene should have been assumed and not shown . that part might bother younger children . otherwise  it  s a great movie for older kids and adults who are a kid at heart .  end   ,1
the pervert  s guide to cinema         br    br   if loving cinema makes me a pervert  so be it   br    br   if you are a true  moviefreak  like me then i  m sure you can  t get enough of films about film  making and i don  t mean necessarily the dry documentary know and then . i mean a total discourse on the film viewing experience . well if that  s the case have i got a lulu of a film experiment for you .  br    br   in sophie fiennes  sister of ralph  joseph if you were wondering  has noted philosopher cum cinephile slavoj zizek give his analysis on cinema with some impressive  and often outrageous  takes on everything from the silent era of chaplin thru the modern age of the wachowski brothers analyzing  probing  and pontificating about the psychosexual underpinnings  socioeconomic  political and of course indefinable magic of the film going experience with his unflagging  determined and near  frenetic dissertations . to go from explaining how the bates  house in psycho is actually the mirrored psyche of the conflicted norman bates with each level as his ego  superego  id is one thing but then to suggest the same thing about each marx brother in barely a beat is a remarkable test of faith that wins over the skeptic layman .  br    br   although i had no idea who zizek was  he resembles a hybrid of filmmaker brian depalma  european actor rade serbedzija and the hyperkinetic energy of filmmakers quentin tarantino and martin scorsese  with his sibilant tongue and passion  the host comes across as a mad prophet .  br    br   fiennes cleverly inserts zizek into several of the film clips  backgrounds peppered throughout making for a humorous tone but still lets the ranting and raving continue full throttle giving pause for argument in three acts covering the gamut of films by the likes of kubrick  lynch  hitchcock and films as diverse as the wizard of oz  the red shoes  and fight club .  br    br   there  s something for everyone and if one man can provoke an argument or at least a reason to discuss a film  s themes  even if they are freudian  jungian to a fault  then i say this collection of film theory is worth the watch . seek it out now if you can before it comes to home video it  s the only way to appreciate it .  ,1
this movie is one of the most unintentionally bad action films ever put to film . dolph friggin  lundren with a japanese accent is funny enough  but add really corny buddy  buddy action to the mix  an eccentric and over  the  top villain  a clichd love interest subplot and one of the worst endings of all time  and you  ve got yourself quite the little suicide  inducing cure for people who enjoy their life and  up till watching  showdown   had never contemplated killing themselves with a blowtorch .  br    br   i don  t know if it  s just me but the whole homosexual subtext is none too subtle . there are constant references to male genitalia  and not by females  either . brandon lee and dolphin talk about each other  s manly parts  and in fact before going on a suicide spree  brandon says to dolphy   in case we don  t make it  i want to tell you  you have the biggest d    i  ve ever seen .   br    br   now  is this what a normal man would say to another man  in an action film no less  and would you want those to be your  dying words     br    br   later  there  s this gem  br    br   dolph  regarding the villain    i would like to cut off certain parts of his anatomy .  brandon  man  you  ve got a fixation .   br    br   as the guy at ruthlessreviews . com pointed out   unfortunately  dolph doesn  t respond with   i  ve got a fixation  i  ve got a fixation   you  re the one who decided that his last words should be about my privates  i was just gonna chop of his ears and his nose  man .   br    br   this is relentlessly silly stuff and great fun if you  re someone who enjoys receiving root canals from unlicensed dentists  without novocain . it  s about on par . great fun for the whole family   ,0
the man in the white suit is one of those delightful comedies that ealing studies made so well in the    s and    s . the plot of this one follows a man that invents a cloth that neither gets dirty nor breaks . of course  this is a huge breakthrough in the world of textiles . however  things are not that simple as the cloth will threaten the way of life of many people  including cloth manufacturers  the cloth mill  s workforces  and even an old lady that does her washing every week . the man in the white suit is a film about scientific advances  and the way that they don  t always help as the old woman says at one point in the movie   why cant you scientists just leave things alone    br    br   like a lot ealing comedies  this one stars sir alec guinness . alec guinness is a fantastic actor he has the ability to light up the screen with his presence  and he does in this film  literally   but he also manages to portray his characters in a down to earth and believable way . he is suitably creepy in this film  and he captures just the right atmosphere for his character an intelligent and ambitious  but slightly naive scientist . along with guinness  the man in the white suit also features joan greenwood  the deep voiced actress that co  starred with guinness in the simply divine  kind hearts and coronets  and michael gough  a man that would go on to get himself the role of alfred in the batman films . the acting in the film isn  t always great  but it is always decent  and it  s fits with the film .  br    br   the man in the white suit is an intelligent  thought  provoking and witty comedy with a moral . the comedy isn  t always obvious  and it doesn  t always work  but the film is not meant to be a film that provokes belly laughs  so that is forgivable . i recommend this movie  basically  to anyone that is a fan of movies .  ,1
if you think  weird al  yankovic is hilarious  you won  t be disappointed by the compleat al . not only does this rare mockumentary feature many of yankovic  s more memorable videos   like a surgeon  and  i love rocky road  among them   but they are inter  spliced with funny vignettes supposedly highlighting the parodist  s rise to fame . yankovic is not for all tastes  but his humor is harmless and imaginative enough that even non  fans will at least be lightly amused . die  hard fans will love it not only for its content  but also for its relatively early look into yankovic  s now nearly three decade career . suitable for all ages  kiddies will no doubt love the funny visuals .  ,1
this is the most compelling and excellent performance that robert taylor ever gave . it even surpasses his wonderful performance as  johnny eager  coming a full   years after that film . his looks are still a wonder to see  but he has a maturity now that gives him the edge in this gritty  violent role . charlie gilson  taylor  is the last of his breed  a buffalo hunter who kills not for the money but for the pleasure . his wild eyed killing of not only buffalo but human beings  is stunning to watch . he is basically a lonely man  needing the people around him  but they dislike him because of his sociopath behavior . his partner is sandy mckenzie  stewart granger  who is sick of the hunt  and only goes along  because he is a failure at anything else . along the way charlie kills a family of indians and captures the beautiful debra pagent . charlie tries to seduce her to no avail  but sees that sandy is interested in her also . granger is kind of sad to watch  so fed up with the hunt  longing to go away with the girl and her baby . lloyd nolan as the drunken skinner is wonderful with his wise cracks and accordian playing . russ tamblyn plays the half breed trying to fit in a white world . the group is an odd mix of good and evil  young and old . in the end taylor gets spooked by the buffalo  as many hunters before him had  and runs off leaving sandy with the girl . upon his return  that night sandy leaves with the woman  setting charlie off on a rampage of killing in a quest to get sandy and have the girl for himself . the final confrontation comes in a snow storm and the last scene is so shocking that you will never forget it . it is taylor  s film all the way and he was truly a much underrated actor of the era .  ,1
this is     and this way underrated gem has lost nothing of the power it had   years ago . it connects a pretty wide variety of different characters and stories without appearing to be cluttered .  br    br   clothes and music might have changed over time  but in the end this is a story that will never lose its up  to  dateness . and especially this movie does the job pretty well . of course it is cheesy at times  but very touching as well .  br    br   jodie foster  s performance is striking  and it shows that she is really a natural born actress who showed her true potential especially in her earlier movies .  br    br   don  t miss this one .  ,1
how do comments like the one that was the headline by high school girls even make it on this site  this was the stupidest movie i have ever seen  it was ridiculous  how can any moron sit there and say that just because a movie makes you jump it is a good movie  that might be the most idiotic thing i have ever heard  i could sneak up behind you and go  boo  and it would make you jump  but that does not mean i am qualified to write or direct a movie  not to mention  they tied everything together at the end  is not a good reason for a movie to be well received . what kind of movie would it be if they didn  t tie everything together  i guess that would make it half a movie  not a whole movie . so basically this idiot girl is complimenting them for finishing the movie  well i love how the youth of today hold the media and production companies to such a high standard . no wonder the political system of this country can get away with whatever they want  we have idiots like that coming up in our country  what would happen if this girl actually ends up leading something someday  that is a scary thought . get a life and go watch a real movie sometime  try shawshank redemption or on the waterfront  or something like that  and don  t comment that it was  boring  after you see it  just use what little brain god gave you to analyze it a little .  ,0

i am compelled to write a review of this imax feature as a means of warning others to save your money . almost any episode of desmond morris   the human animal  or david suzuki  s  the nature of things  could have bested the material presented . not only does the director fail to make use of imax  s incredible   to   mm film stock and gigantic presentation screen  everything on screen is extremely unimpressive given the accessibility of such programming mentioned previously . viewers are introduced to a pregnant heather  her husband buster  and their niece and nephew . we follow them for an interminable forty  odd minutes as they eat  sweat  listen to music  etc . although we are given access to scenes inside the human digestive track and learn about babies  natural diving reflexes  do we really learn anything more than most grade  school graduates  are we even remotely entertained by the trans  atlantic heather  do we care  avoid this film at all cost . if you do wish to see an imax feature  i suggest the beautifully photographed  india kingdom of the tiger  or the technically thrilling  space station  d  . trust me .  ,0
i thought this was a splendid showcase for mandy  s bodacious bod . if you don  t expect anything else  such as clever plot twists and believable character development  you won  t be disappointed . consider this a sports illustrated shoot whose character goes around killing people  especially those who threaten to come between her and her  mommy   suzanna arquette  who obviously doesn  t want to play the sex kitten  she leaves that up to her daughter  .  br    br   mandy  s face is a little too perfect  but her body is a complete   alarm fire  up there in the ranks of sophia loren when it comes to natural bustiness  a perfect   to    ratio of waist to hips  and splendidly configured legs  right down to her feet .  there has to be some ideal configuration of thighs to knees to calves to ankles that is altogether pleasing to the eye mandy certainly is the model for this idealized ratio  .  br    br   and no flat butt to boot  which seems to be the undoing of many a busty babe with curves everywhere except in the  nether hemispheres  . mandy might have used a body double in the rear shot of her losing her towel as she descended into the candle  lit hot tub with her blindfolded german  guy victim no .   but from all i could see from her bikini shots  she had the butt for it and didn  t need a double to prove it .  br    br   mandy  s acting abilities had little to do with her impression of a psychotic  mommy  s girl   with the obvious erotic lesbian overtones . her bisexual nature  allowing herself to be boinked in the hot tub after a long flirtation with german guy no .   who also happened to be her mother  s lover  added an additional dimension to an otherwise one  dimensional caricature of adolescent female horniness conflicted with pathological murderous impulses  always by water with the men  the ultimate fate of the latina housekeeper was edited out in the televised version for some obscure reason  .  br    br   mandy  s uber  nordic facial features coupled with her uber  voluptuous body could either be a blessing or a curse . if mandy really wants to further her career as an actress  i  d advise her to immerse herself fully in the romance languages  especially italian and spanish  and maybe french  although i don  t know if they would go for her type . but this would enable her to reconcile her bo derek face with her vida guerra body  but maybe her face is just a little too nordic  and she has shown off too much of her extraordinary body in a cheesy movie to enable her to advance to any more fame that was enjoyed by michelle johnson of the      s whose early fame in blame it on rio was followed by a series of skin flicks that failed to make it off the ground .  br    br   vambo drule .  ,1
personally i think this show looks pretty cheaply made . some of the actors are terrible . they over do it  seem fake . i can always tell how it  s going to end within the first   minutes or less of watching because they make it so transparently clear . it  s not very well written either . i love to watch it to laugh at it . you know the saying  it  s so bad that it  s good   well  that saying applies to this show . i also like to watch just to see if i  m right when i guess how it  s all going to end . so far i  ve been right every time . it  s like a little game that i play . it  s nice when you are bored  you feel like laughing at something .  ,0
i like the time period  i like the attempt  but watching a movie that looks like i  m looking at it through a coke bottle gives me a headache . if i played computer games that were this blurry and out of focus  i would upgrade my computer . could be that this was the look the director was after  but not so it hurts the eyes and you want to leave after   minutes . if i hadn  t taken someone with me to this film  i was out of there . even though it was a series and not a movie per say  band of brothers accomplished this . they made it look like wwii footage  with just a touch of graininess  but it was still a pleasure to watch . movies need real people  with real sets  and real locations use cgi when it is appropriate  not for an entire film .  ,0
psychotic transsexual bobbi murders the patient  angie dickinson  of a prominent doctor  michael caine  and then pursues the high  priced prostitute  nancy allen  who caught a glimpse of bobbi in the elevator . liz  allen  comes under suspicion of the crime and teams up with the patient  s son  keith gordon  to catch the killer .  br    br   it can be summed up in a couple of words it  s very sexy  dickinson and allen look great   it  s very bloody  with the kind of gore usually reserved for splatter movies  and boy is it well crafted . writer  director de palma  s script is ok but it really takes a backseat to the man  s film  making abilities . it is highly successful on a visceral level and i actually get involved  interested with these characters . i can notice the standard de palma homages to  ripoffs of hitchcock  at least from one of the master  s pictures .  br    br   and to top it all off  it has a professional and believable cast .  br    br   this was de palma  s third movie with ex  wife nancy allen  after  carrie  and  home movies  .   br    br   by the way  dancer  turned  actress rachel ticotin was one of the production assistants . there  s a bit of trivia for you .  br    br   i wouldn  t think a thriller could be classy and bloody at the same time but this picture pulls it off .  br    br   one of the best things about it is a typically striking pino donaggio music score .  br    br        ,1
i disagree with much that has been written and said about this supposed  masterpiece  of the german new wave  br    br     there are major flaws in simple exposition  in the basic communication of critical plot points  as relating to maria  s abortion and the secret contract between oswald and her husband . how many viewers understood that the husband agreed  in exchange for substantial financial remuneration  not to return to and reclaim his wife until oswald was dead   br    br     the ending is highly unsatisfying because arbitrary and accidental . the original screenplay called for maria to commit suicide after the reading of oswald  s will  on finding out that her husband had in effect sold their marriage to oswald . in the final version  however  maria only runs water from a faucet across her wrist in a gesture of suicide . maria is then summarily blown up  rather than having to confront and live with the consequences of her self  delusion and moral compromise .  br    br     fassbinder seeks to forcibly superimpose the public on the private  the political on the personal . contrary to what the critics and  experts  assert  i don  t think it works . merely intruding historic radio news or the sound of the jackhammers of german reconstruction in the soundtrack on the dramatic events of the movie does not make those historical events integral to the drama .  br    br   the selfish ambition of maria  s rise from poverty to prosperity is meant to parallel the so  called economic miracle of postwar germany . maria is thus intended to be a woman specific to and reflective of her time and place  but is in reality unoriginal and nonspecific . women have been asserting their independence by using sex for self  advancement for ages .  br    br     lastly  there are several instances of inexcusable sloppiness and amateurishness   fassbinder  s drug addiction and consequent impatience and inattention have had their effect . unknown people talk off screen without ever being seen music is clumsily intrusive in places and melodramatic posturing sporadically substitutes for acting .  br    br   strangely  for a movie condemning a country for willful collective amnesia of the holocaust  it itself never mentions it once .  ,0
this filmfour funded sci  fi movie is most definitely a must see . while it takes huge influence from the manchurian candidate and offers nothing new or original plot wise it  s handled with the utmost skill that it comes off as being fresh and inventive  despite it being basically a re  run of an earlier film . it  s good to know that films like this are still being made  even if they aren  t getting wide releases   and cypher is refreshing for that reason . the plot twists and turns  which gives it an element of paranoia and also serves in keeping the audience on the edge of their seat while trying to figure out the meaning of cypher  s mystery . the plot follows morgan sullivan a bored suburban man that decides to take a job with digicorp that involves him listening to speeches from several rival companies and recording them for reasons  to him  unknown . however  his job is interrupted when he meets a mysterious young lady known as rita . . .  br    br   this film features a number of stark white backgrounds that give it a very surreal edge and blend well with it  s apocalyptic imaging of the future . this gives the film a very odd look that sets it apart from the majority of other films of the same type  with it  s only real close affiliate being kubrick  s a clockwork orange . the plot is also very efficient and ditches character development in favour of the more stylish  and more thrilling  plot developing . you never quite know where you are with the plot  which serves in making it all the more intriguing . the acting is largely good with a largely unknown cast backing up the team of stars jeremy northam and lucy lui . northam very much looks the part of the quiet and disheartened man at the centre of the tale  and does well with his role . lucy lui is an actress that has a resume that doesn  t quite fit her talent  but she has a look about her that just fits this movie .  br    br   cypher is far from perfect as some of the sequences are illogical and at times it can be inconsistent but on the whole  if you want an inventive recent sci  fi film cypher is the way to go .  ,1
wow and i thought that any steven segal movie was bad . every time i thought that the movie couldn  t get worse it proved me wrong . the story was good but the actors couldn  t carry it off . also  they made a lot of mistakes on how proper archiological digs are done . for instance you don  t handle artifacts untill they are catologed and accounted for . the biggest crime in casting was the archiologist girl . she is a weak actress and i felt that her acting really made the movie less realistic then it already was . the whole concept of the knights templar being underground all these years seemed pretty stupid to me . i like the idea of how they disappeared and stuff  so that almost seemed depressing . i thought that the characters wern  t explained well enough . you didn  t find out much background and that made it harder to relate to them .  ,0
to be honest i watched this movie only because of my pubert needs . i mean  i couldn  t get women at my age  i was  or    so i thought watching elvira  s cleavage was the closet thing to sex .  br    br   i ended up having a great time with this cult classic about horror comedy  halloween parties  sassy humor  and some sexy evil displayed by elvira .  br    br   they just don  t make movies like this anymore . . . it had the feeling of an amateur effort mixed with a late night cable talk show host style .  br    br   the truth is that it generated plenty of fans because of it  s humor and the ability to perform by cassandra .  br    br   this is classic that reminds me of the good days of usa up all night .  ,1
why would any legitimate actor having read the script participated in this piece of crap  my god it is actually embarrassing to even watch it . i can  t imagine the shame these people must feel for being a part of it . also  there is apparently some controversy as to whether river phoenix had a cameo in the movie . he was uncredited but his list of roles here  imdb  does give him credit . btw . . . rain is his sister for those who have were asking before . this film is proof that no matter how many big  names  you have . sow  s ears don  t make silk purses . i love lorraine bracco but this was just sad  sad  sad . . . maybe somebody someday can explain to me the reason for this kind of film . it has no endearing  entertaining  or even comedic properties in comparison to it  s bad everything else .  ,0
this story is about the romantic triangle between a nth . african male prostitute  a french transsexual prostitute  stephanie  and a russian waiter who speaks no french and never seems to shave .  br    br   as a film it is dull  dreary and depressing  shot either on foggy  overcast winter days or in badly lit interiors  where everyone is bathed in a weird blue luminescence . and yes  i know  it  s because the white balance was out . everyone is pale and downcast and looks haggard  shabby and dirty . bodies are bony and shot in such closeup that they look quite ugly and unappealing . moles  greasy hair . yuk . bad news in a film where people spend a lot of time either naked or having sex .  br    br   and the story  well  stephanie  s mother is dying . all three characters go back to stephanie  s home village where  through a bunch of flashbacks to desolate countryside and predictably dingy interiors  we see a bit of stephanie  s childhood as a boy called pierre . the mother dies . well . . . and that  s about it  really . character development is kept to a minimum  as is the denouement of the story .  br    br   i suppose the storyline is not linear  it would explain a lot of non sequiteurs  but really  after paying my seven euros i don  t feel like having to construct the film myself that  s what the director takes my money for . to expect me to join the story telling process and get my hands dirty  so to speak  is asking way too much .  br    br   this film is a heap of pretentious rubbish made  above all  from a desire to epater les bourgeois  ie shock the straights  . i can see how it was a shoo  in for the berlin film festival  and i can see why it got nowhere .  ,0
although others have commented that this video is just an edited version of the two shows  fire in space  and  living legend   if you watch the original shows you  ll find that dialogue from this video edition was edited out . i found this video version much better because scenes and lines were added to it . i would say if you want to see the show in its original version  see the video versions on vhs . they have more to offer the fan than the original episodes being offered on dvd now . another good video is conquest for the earth  which had more scenes from galactica     than did the actual broadcasts themselves . overall  i rate this as a   because it gives you more to enjoy than what the networks wanted to show in the time slot they gave the producers .  ,1

valliant effort to use a mining catastrophe as a vehicle to pronounce this director  s distaste for war . the audience not only learns a great deal about early mining rescue procedures but  we learn that europeans at the interval between wwi and wwii  had concerning pacifists  for lack of a better term  . the speeches given by both representatives of each country at the end of the film  are inspiring given the time . although the revised edition  through the transfer technology of early foreign films   cuts  off characters heads  at times  this film holds it  s own in many different aspects . character analysis  lighting techniques  historical content and a scenario that has tested and inspired many a writer and filmmaker .  br    br   pabst went on to direct and put to screen weil  brecht  s  three penny opera   starring the original star  lotte lenya .  ,1
i managed to see this at the new york international film festival in november     with my boyfriend . we were both quite impressed with the complexity of the plot and found it to be emotionally moving . it was very well directed with strong imagery . the visual effects were amazing  especially for a short . it had an original fantasy approach to a very real and serious topic this film is about a young girl who is visited by a demon offering to help her situation with her abusive father . there is also a surprise twist at the end which caught me off guard . this leans towards the gothic feel . i would love to see this as a full feature film .   carrie  ,1
in cold blood has to be ranked as first  rate movie  making  even if the subject matter is about as grim as it gets in the world of make  believe  but film noir fans should definitely find this one a gripping piece of work  based as it is on a true  life crime spree .  br    br   it opens with quincy jones  music under the credits and starkly dramatic views of a highway bus heading toward kansas city  effectively setting the mood of the film even before the credits end . the bw photography of conrad hall does a superb job right from the start .  br    br   also clear from the start robert blake and scott wilson are natural born actors . they do a great job of portraying free spirited buddies looking for the next thrill .  ever see a millionaire fry in the electric hair  hell no . there are two kinds of rules in this world . one for the rich and one for the poor   says wilson  taking a swig of alcohol behind the wheel .  br    br   both are destined to cross the path of a farm family  showing no mercy and leaving no witnesses behind .  br    br   blake  reminiscing about movies  and thinking of hunting for gold in mexico  says  remember bogart in  treasure of the sierra madre     an ironic moment  because blake himself was in the film as a little boy selling lottery tickets  .  i got you pegged for a natural born killer   wilson tells blake .  br    br   john forsythe is one of the lead detectives on the case  discovering that all four family members were tied up  shot in the head and one had his throat cut .  don  t people around here lock doors   asks paul stewart .  they will tonight   is the terse reply .  br    br   after the murders  the killers discover that there was  no big fat safe in the wall   like their prison informant told them . so  in the end  it was truly a stupid  senseless crime . the question is why did they do it  and this is something the second half of the film explores in depth . it takes an hour and a half into the movie before the detectives catch up with the killers and begin the interrogation .  br    br   it  s these final scenes that carry the most conviction and the most interest as the boys are told they  ve made numerous mistakes and left a living witness . the actual events up to and including the murder are saved until the end .  it makes no sense   blake tells forsythe .  mr . cutter was a very nice gentleman . i thought so right up until the time i cut his throat .  the screenplay by richard brooks is concise and to the point   and so is his direction .  br    br   summing up brilliant depiction of two aimless young men on a crime spree that made no sense then or now for a mere    . chilling .  ,1
the performances in this movie were fantastic . the dialogue was great . jason patric delivered a fantastic performance as  kid  collins in this wonderful adaptation of the jim thompson novel . far superior to  the grifters   which was a good movie  this film really stayed true to the pulp fiction  film noir roots from which the story came . i recommend this movie to all film noir fans .  ,1
this movie had me going . the title was perhaps the greatest idea that i heard . i thought it was an independent movie about a zombie outbreak and their quest to take over the us and a group of lone survivors  band together  and plan to take out the zombies . dead wrong  it  s about a psycho cop with a weakness for killing his female arrests gets what  s coming to him when a pack of zombie women rise from their graves in order to get proper revenge . as you can see there is nothing about the nation nor a county involved . where to begin with the severity this cinematic disaster caused our nation .  br    br   first off  the zombie women look like victoria secret models with dark eyeliner and a pale face . what are zombies but mindless  debatable intelligent  cannibalistic killing machines that eat as a result of their primitive most basic needs  these zombie women walk like streetwalkers and runway models  they talk as if they are in a poor film noir movie and not do they act like real zombies . sure the eating and killing is there  but where is the mindlessness and the horrible disfigurement  although it is a very interesting concept and perhaps a great satire on the zombie genre  it makes fun of that genre and asks the question   why can  t zombies be beautiful vixen killing machines   i would say that this movie would be considered a really bad indie movie that was produced and made by garage junkies . i would not recommend this movie to anybody that loves zombie genres too much  it  s an insult and as for scarynot even .  ,0
finally            i  ve been waiting for this film to come out for almost a year  and finally saw it at the premiere in sb . i met a few of the actors  who were really nice and who were great in the movie . i watched the trailer so many times that i didn  t know what to expect but got totally sucked in . the film was really beautiful to look at it and the music was good too . i recommend it to anyone who  s a ryan donowho fan  and dominique swain was good in it too . the other actors were good also great . i hope it comes out on dvd soon       br    br   i first got into ryan from watching the oc and then saw him in a bunch of good indies like imaginary heroes . he is great in this film  and everything that he does that  s indie . i also like dominique but haven  t seen her in as much . hope to see them both in more soon     ,1

yeh  i know   you  re quivering with excitement . well  the secret lives of dentists will not upset your expectations it  s solidly made but essentially unimaginative  truthful but dull . it concerns the story of a married couple who happen to be dentists and who share the same practice  already a recipe for trouble if it wasn  t for our separate work  lives  we  d all ditch our spouses out of sheer irritation  . campbell scott  whose mustache and demeanor don  t recall everyman so much as ned flanders from the simpsons  is the mild  mannered  uber  dad husband  and hope davis is the bored  stiff housewife who channels her frustrations into amateur opera . one night  as dad  the daughters attend one of davis  performances  he discovers that his wife is channeling her frustrations into more than just singing he witnesses his wife kissing and flirting with the director of opera .  one nice touch we never see the opera  director  s face .  dreading the prospect of instituting the proceedings for separation  divorce  and custody hearings   profitable only to the lawyers   scott chooses to pretend ignorance of his wife  s indiscretions .  br    br   already  the literate among you are starting to yawn ho  hum  another story about the pathetic  sniveling little cuckold . but rudolph  who took the story from a jane smiley novella  hopes that the wellworn  ness of the material will be compensated for by a series of flashy  postmodern touches . for instance  one of scott  s belligerent patients  denis leary  kept relatively   and blessedly   in check  will later become a sort of construction of the dentist  s imagination  emerging as a devil  on  the  shoulder advocate for the old  fashioned masculine virtues   dump the b    h    etc .  . when not egged  on by his imaginary new buddy  scott is otherwise tormented by fantasies that include his wife engaged in a three  way with two of the male dental  assistants who work in their practice . it  s not going too far to say that this movie is eyes wide shut for real people  or grown  ups  at least  . along those lines  campbell scott and hope davis are certainly recognizable human beings as compared to the glamourpuss pair of cruise and kidman . further  the script for secret lives is clearly more relevant than kubrick  s . as proof  i offer the depiction of the dentists  children  particularly the youngest one who is about  or  years old  and whose main utterance is  dad  dad  dad  dad  dad  dad     this is family life  all right  with all its charms .  br    br   the movie would make an interesting double  bill with kramer vs . kramer  as well . one can easily trace the feminization of the american male from     to     . in this movie  dad is the housewife as in kramer  but he is in no way flustered by the domestic role  unlike dustin hoffman  who was too manly to make toast . here  scott gets all the plumb chores  such as wiping up the children  s vomit  cooking  cleaning  taking the kids to whatever inane after  school activity is on the docket . and all without complaint .  and without directorial commentary . it  s just taken for granted .   br    br   the film has virtues  mostly having to do with verisimilitude . however  it  s dragged down from greatness by its insistence on trendy distractions  which culminate in a long scene where a horrible five  day stomach flu makes the rounds in the household . we must endure pointless fantasy sequences  initiated by the imaginary ringleader leary . whose existence  by the way  is finally reminiscent of the brad pitt character in fight club . and this finally drives home the film  s other big flaw lack of originality . in this review  i realize it  s been far too easy to reference many other films . granted  this film is an improvement on most of them  but still . the secret lives of dentists is worth seeing  but don  t get too excited about it .  not that you were all that excited  anyway . i guess .   ,0
yeah  i  get  pasolini and his milieu  but at the same time  i feel his  decameron  is largely overrated  and more than a little disturbing . overrated because the supposed  realism  he introduces  milling crowds  crumbling architecture  etc .  are mooted by the absurd and downright goofy way that the characters behave . in the pursuit of realism  pasolini utilized many non  actors  but their deer  in  the  headlights stares and painfully awkward line delivery gives the whole a terribly off  kilter and inconsistent feel . and frankly   many of the toothless  misshapenly  featured people are painful to look at .  br    br   and pasolini  s  decameron  is disturbing  to me at least  because of the casual and prevalent homosexual content . not because i  m prudish or homophobic  i  m neither  but because the emphasis that pasolini places upon homoerotic images and situations is contrary to the neo  realism he otherwise espouses  so it comes off as gratuitous and forced . one can almost hear him say  ooh   i  ve got to stick a cute  naked boy in this scene   at times it seems that pasolini is trying to play up the homosexual angle to thumb his nose at critics  and at other times because he enjoys that aspect himself  regardless of what his audience might prefer .  br    br   the disjointedness of the  or   different stories in pasolini  s  decameron  struck me as being a failing of pasolini as a storyteller  rather than being an aspect of neo  realism . he seems to get bored with each story and so he wraps them up rather unconvincingly and with little conviction . even the pasolini  s final line of dialog in the film  which some people seem to find pithy   why create a work of art when dreaming about it is so much sweeter      to me  it just makes me wonder why pasolini would bother making a film if he felt this way  in my opinion  a far better  crafted film  and with more homosexual content  is fellini  s  satyricon  . it is also full of bizarre  looking people and absurd situations  but it succeeds because of its pacing  direction and strong storytelling whereas  decameron  fails by those same elements .  ,0

we should all congratulate uwe boll . he  s done the unthinkable . he may be the only director to have two movies in the bottom    on imdb  he  s like some kind of cinematic cockroach . no matter how little talent he has  and no matter how bad these movies are  he manages to keep making them . i know  he finances them all himself through some kind of bizarre german fund  but even so  his ability to keep making movies despite absolute  complete failure is one of the great mysteries of the universe .  br    br   it wouldn  t be so bad except that video game developers keep giving their best properties to this guy . i really enjoyed the alone in the dark series of games . even the latest one  the new nightmare  was good for a few hours of game play . there was a good movie to be made out of edward carnby  s adventures  but this is not it . now uwe boll has gotten his hands on bloodrayne and hunter the reckoning . what  s next  silent hill  doom  i can only imagine the swath that this guy is going to cut through game  to  movie adaptations if he  s not stopped . someone needs to take away his line of credit  or these video game publishers need to wise up and realize that when they make a bad movie out of a game that kills the franchise  no one is interested in that title any more .  br    br   think about it  is house of the dead or alone in the dark a viable game title anymore  no way . a new house of the dead game comes out for x  box and nobody  s gonna care . the title is dead  and all because of uwe boll . so if any of you out there work for a game publisher  or know a game publisher  or have access to a game publisher . . . please warn them .  br    br   this movie itself is not even worth reviewing . i can  t separate what i didn  t like about this pile of dung from the rest of it . literally  everything about it sucks . the writing  the acting  the music  the cg effects  the editing . i thought that if i waited until it came out on dvd and then rented it with low expectations  i wouldn  t be disappointed . boy  was i wrong . never underestimate uwe  s ability to turn out a big  steaming pile of boll sht .  ,0
in the third entry of the phantasm series  mike and reggie continue chasing the tall man  assisted by a trigger  happy  year old  a black g . i . jane and the spirit of mike  s deceased brother  he died in the original phantasm  . number  is a rather disappointing sequel  since the gore and black comedy is a lot less inspired and exciting as it was in phantasm ii . i got the feeling the stress was merely laid on reggie  s incompetence as a lover and his talent as stand  up comedian . the humor in the previous film was a lot more dry and oppressed  which fits a story like this better . also  the settings aren  t as macabre here  plus the constant presence of the tall man  agnus schrim  isn  t as obvious there still is plenty of gore but not half as satisfying this time . by the way  beware for the severely cut version as it shows most delightful killings off  screen . the entire phantasm series is the lifetime achievement of don coscarelli  who wrote and directed  episodes so farthe fifth being in production . the first one is a semi  cult classic  the second is a horror  feast of gore and violence and the rest can easily be skipped . a . michael baldwin returns as mike  even though james legros portrayed his character a lot better in phantasm ii .  ,0

another fantastic film from a country  where due to decades of oppression from fundamentalist regimes  has no problems in creating passionate subject matter . panahi takes a different approach this time around with a blend of ironic comedy and an endearing  non  professional cast . while still getting across his message of what he sees as being inherently wrong with his country  he does so without the need of a heavy storyline . it is a positive take on a country  in particular its people  that the iranian population desperately need . the greatest pity is it won  t be released domestically . the insular  paranoid iranian government assert that this fine film maker is only successful overseas because he is part of a global conspiracy to embarrass them . after growing up amid revolution and watching the academics  artists and educated  disappear  over the last   years he shows great bravery in continuing to put his work out there . the realism achieved by shooting at the actual world cup qualifier really transports you to the event . the fact he shot it on   mm is amazing as most would only attempt this project using a digital format . it looks fantastic . his insistence in only using non  professional actors also really works in this film . fine performances all round . after watching many films showing the problems iran has and also the news media reporting the facts we can tend to demonise the people as well as the government . this film does the opposite . it shows us they still love the same things and that by laughing at themselves and the absurd rules of sharia law that maybe a change for the better isn  t too far away . some call panahi a feminist film maker but i think he just fights for the most oppressed demographic in iran . young  independent women .  ,1
this movie had a fairly good sounding plot  but the paste was very slow . . . very slow indeed . even if someone thinks this is a cult classic  i think that there are a lot better films from that era to be watched .  br    br   the cinematography is not excellent  but not the worst either . the sounds are ok . lighting ok .  br    br   i still wouldn  t recommend this to anyone else than maybe a film  student .  br    br   the movie does not contain music  and the horses having sex don  t make it a good one either . and the woman masturbating on the edge of the bed was plain stupid .  br    br   no winnings here  skip this utter boredom . i  ve seen worse believe me  but this is just waste of time  and i don  t get the good reviews here . especially the high ratings . . .  ,0
how can anybody say that this movie is a comedy   if i had not gone with then my finacee i would have fallen asleep and asked for my money back . i love gwen paltrow  but it was like she was on the wrong set . i like most chick flicks  but i hated this one . this is the only time i saw so much clevage and was not turned on . those outfits were way overdone . no one talks that way anymore and i don  t think they even did then . the dancing part was horrible . my ex said to me later . . .  didn  t ya like that part  didn  t ya think it was sensous   i said yes only to spare her feelings . now i know why we never married . this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen .  ,0
stardust another guarded review  originally written june          br    br   the marketing machine has only just begun for this one  no site yet  wth    so i doubt most of you have heard about it . in truth  i hadn  t either  sort of  . when i got the posting  i thought it was another code name and was actually worried it was transformers  one of the movies i want to see when not working so i an enjoy it     as a mere mortal movie  goer . turns out  it wasn  t transformers and i had been aware of it way back when as  that neil gaiman movie  . what is it about  well  in short  it  s a gaiman fairy tale about a boy and a fallen star . any more than that and i  d be giving away plot info which is  a  a breach of contract  and  b  spoiling your fun . if you really want to know what it  s about  go buy the book . rumour has it  gaiman might be something of a writer .  br    br   not knowing what to expect in a movie can be so pleasant if the surprise is worthwhile . and for this one  it certainly was . this screening was  special  in that it included not just film critics  but also exhibitors  they rarely have a mixed screening  and local sci  fi  fantasy folks . so  you know the expected audience  right  i mean  with this crowd and the title of stardust  i knew what to expect .  br    br   oh how sweetly wrong i was .  br    br   yes  it is a fairy tale written by an author famed in comic bookdom . but it was not lord of rings . it was not even another lord of the rings wannabe  ahem  eragon  . it was much more intimate than all that .  br    br   but  like lord of the rings  it was the  well  humanism of the film which sells the fantastical qualities . it  s surely a romantic tale  but with generous splashes of humour . and that humour is of the sort which is not slapstick shrekism . it  s more along the lines of dramedy than comedy . before i go on  let  s do this movie review thing .  br    br   acting is  in the very least  good . it  s always hard to say more than that for fantasy films but i do believe there were significant superbly acted roles . michelle pfieffer is not  sadly  one of those . she plays a villain  and she does the job . nothing special . rupert everett  though  he was a real jerk . that is  a great villain . peter o  toole is  well  peter frickin  o  toole   which is marvelous . ricky gervais is perfectly cast and shows why . robert de niro seemed to be having too much fun for the most part . when he wanted to deliver the goods  though  he did . and charlie cox  who   as the lead character was fine surprise from a guy i ain  t never heard of .  br    br   claire danes . claire danes . claire danes . i  ve always been of mixed opinion with her . she can be great  and then she can seem to miss the mark . in this  she  s the former . and she is  quite literally  the star of this film . sure  her accent stumbles here and there . and  yes  she  s not as good as she can be when cox isn  t in the scene . however . . . well  see for yourself .  br    br   special effects are muted yet accomplished  and only significant where they should be . best flying ship yet   sorry potter . direction is light  hearted and flows nicely . cinematography could have been better but not everyone films in new zealand . all else is top bracket .  br    br   and now that that  s done . . .  br    br   . . . the writing . oh  the writing  neil  you devil . it  s hard in today  s climate to do anything original and  at first  you begin to wonder . a kingdom  a dying king  a boy out to prove his own worth  witches  ghosts  a quest  or three    what  s new  but gaiman  s story draws you in with its surface familiarity only to subvert it all into a sweetly original tale of a boy and his heart . and  though you suspect how it  s all going to turn out  you begin to wonder in the third act and   if you  re me   find yourself pulled into the rousing climactic confrontation and hoping for the best . in the end  you  ll find this story  this movie  is what all fairy tales should be but all too often are not . fantastical and real .  br    br    i wish i could talk about septimus vs tristan but i won  t ruin it for you . for those who read the book  rest assured  it  s done properly .   br    br   those i spoke to afterward had the same impression i did . a great film for all ages to enjoy  and the new withheld for this generation . the blank gets filled  in only after the movie is in wide release because  well  you might be expecting it . you  ll know when you walk out  anyway . i sincerely hope stardust doesn  t get lost among the tentpoles . even if it does  it  ll be my pleasure to push into the hands of everyone i know .  br    br       br    br   forgot to add the withheld reveal . i  m a few years late  but . . .  a great film for all ages to enjoy  and the new the princess bride for this generation .   br    br   perhaps a bit lofty an assessment but i  m still confident that years form now  there will be the same  oh  i love that movie   response to this as there is now for the princess bride .  ,1
i saw that movie  and i was shocked  robert carlyle isn  t hitler he is a man who sadly tries to be hitler . the movie lies  it doesn  t reflect the truth . in the scene were hitler hit the guy with his gun . hitler never had hit anybody  he wouldn  t hit people with his fist  but with the fists of soldiers . understand   another thing is it is too obvious  that hitler is that evil  he was more clever  than shown in this movie . no german would have accepted him as the leader  because the can see that he is evil . so the real hitler haven  t shown his evil side to the people .  br    br   have any of you yankees watched the movie  der untergang  or  the dawnfall   this is a great movie  with amazing actors . and its a german movie . i think  this theme of nazi  germany  should not be realized as a movie by people who don  t know anything of germany . people  watch  der untergang    br    br   http   www . imdb . com  title  tt          br    br   its a great movie about a very sad period of time for human beings around the world .  ,0
picture bride has an excellent look into hawaii  s past and the people who lived there in that time . the time  money earned and the hours that these people had put into their lives to survive and live  takes a whole new meaning to blood  sweat and tears .  br    br   the concept of dating  matchmaking is something like what we do similar today via the net . just that is more of snail mail . very slow snail mail .  br    br   the singing of the plantation  s songs from the workers reminds me of the southern plantation workers  songs of their demise and future goals .  br    br   the movie shows the hardship as well as soft romantic scenes that hawaii can bring . like the stillness of a storm coming and the sudden chaos of the rain and then the tranquility .  ,1
steven spielberg  at    had already directed two superb episodes of a     series called  the psychiatrist   starring roy thinnes . one episode had been about an emotionally troubled    year old boy and the other was about a vibrant young man  clu gulager in his best performance  who is dying of cancer . both episodes were stunning  visually unlike anything else on tv  and emotionally complex and adult . the creators of  the psychiatrist  were richard levinson and william link  who created  columbo  and also produced its first season .  br    br   peter falk insisted on first rank  experienced tv directors for the first season of  columbo   like bernard kowalski and jack smight . but falk agreed to spielberg after watching part of the clu gulagher episode of  the psychiatrist  .  br    br   spielberg says on the dvd of  duel  that he loved steven bochco  s  murder by the book  script  based on a levinson  link story   and he tried to make the production look like a million dollar feature  even thought he had a lot less money to work with .  br    br   this episode of  columbo  is far more visually stylish and makes better use of the sound track and background music than almost any other  columbo  episode  even though the series always used top directors . spielberg manages to keep the great falk and cassidy from hamming it up too much  but both actors are still a lot of fun . spielberg also gets fine supporting work from martin milner  rosemary forsyth and barbara colby . all the performances have a freshness and vitality about them . the only  columbo  episode that was close to being as well directed is the  by dawn  s early light  episode with patrick mcgoohan  directed by harvey hart  .  br    br   i think the two episodes of  the psychiatrist  and this episode of  columbo  suggest spielberg hasn  t developed technically all that much as a director . he was great from the beginning . in a  combat   dvd commentary of a     episode guest starring albert salmi  robert altman says that episode was pretty much as good as he ever got as a director . maybe the same is true of spielberg .  ,1

despite a decent first season this series never came close to realizing its potential . set as a prequel to the original  star trek  series it was doomed almost from the start by an executive producer  rick berman  who felt compelled to artificially limit and constrict the definition of what a  star trek  series could be  which made this futuristic show increasingly anachronistic from a dramatic standpoint  . the actual show  runner  brannon braga  didn  t help matters by his uninspired and tired rehashing of previous trek episodes and careless disregard of the franchise  s internal mythology  it was painfully obvious early on that he was in it only for the paycheck  . never have i seen a series  that so consistently did a disservice to a cast of talented actors  jolene blaylock excepted  last so long . it is as if this entire series was produced in bubble existing outside the contemporary television landscape where the audience  even a trekker audience  is more demanding and sophisticated in their dramatic wants and desires . unfortunately it appears as if berman and braga have succeeded in convincing the higher ups at paramount that  enterprise  suffered from  franchise fatigue  and that its core audience was did not walk away but was driven off . produce a quality offering that lives up to the high ideals and standards of its predecessors and they  the audience  will come .  br    br   simply put  in a teevee universe where we are given shows like  battlestar galactica  and  the shield  the powers  that  be must give the viewing public a  star trek  that measures up and is dramatically competitive . it is just that straightforward and easy .  ,0
sammo hung  s     film pedicab driver is considered by many to be his masterpiece . i have to agree to some extent as the film in its greatest parts really gets as incredible and fantastic as any hong kong film ever has . it is a combination of pretty good and well written drama  interesting and sympathetic  and also non  sympathetic  characters  some genuinely funny humor and truly over  the  top hyper kung fu that is guaranteed to make many jaws drop when someone not familiar with hong kong cinema watches the film as well as it does to the experienced enthusiasts of the unique industry .  br    br   sammo and max mok siu chung play two pedicab drivers who live in hong kong in the middle part of the last century  i think . they drive their cabs and are also desperate for love . sammo is interested in local baker girl ping  nina li chi  while max one day meets a mysterious and beautiful fennie yuen kit  ying he falls madly in love with . many other characters get introduced  too  and they remain pretty clear all the time if the viewer really concentrates on the film and its plot so i cannot say the film is confusing as it could be much worse especially in hong kong  soon we get to know  for instance  that a ruthless gangster family is terrorizing the neighborhood and of course their violent acts affect our protagonists  too  and so the premise for some of the most incredibly choreographed kung fu fight sequences has been created . as well as some nice drama .  br    br   the film has a great cast . the leads are all very good and restrained  not as painfully awful over  acting and  humor  as in sammo  s otherwise great eastern condors        for example  and they are also  thanks to the carefully written screenplay  pretty likable and easy to identify with . the cast includes many familiar hk cinema faces and directors in small roles like corey yuen kwai  the legendary action director and director of films like saviour of the soul  and   ninja in the dragon  s den and fong sai yuk  and    the masterful composer lowell lo koon  ting  john woo  s the killer and ringo lam  s school on fire and prison on fire among many others  pedicab driver included    the shaw veteran liu chia liang  whom with sammo has a furious fight with sticks   alfred cheung kin  ting  the director of dark hk noir classic on the run from       the late great lam ching ying  best known for his friendly face in various hk vampire horror  kung fu  comedies  to name just a few . in fact  the cast in pedicab driver is one of the most interesting i  ve seen in any other hk production .  br    br   the film has some interesting peaceful moments most notably about the love affair between max mok and fennie yuen and one crisis they confront thanks to lowell lo  s character . they really could have done this a completely serious piece if they had wanted as the discussions about human values and meaning of love  no matter what  s your past or what you  ve done for living  get so serious and genuinely effective at the middle part that the film immediately gets much more noteworthy than our average kung fu spectacle actioner . also the other characters  efforts to cure things is very touching and tells delightfully much about right human relations and friendship  and of course love . still i think what fennie says to max  about the future  bad cooking   is very unnecessary and tones the potential of the whole segment and its themes down pretty effectively  unfortunately .  br    br   but then we get to the thing the film makers were interested the most in . which is the action  the outrageous and over  the  top action . the fight scenes include traditional kung fu  some sticks  meat cleavers and the like and they  re used here as hysterically as in the most mind blowing kung fu scene i  ve seen in any film ever  jackie chan  s drunken master ii        they really are that great  there are wires and they  re used very cleverly and people literally fly to the opposite corner of the room when they get kicked or punched . simply amazing and again something only hong kong cinema can deliver . also the dangerous stunts make the viewer hold his  her breath as the film has one fast car vs . pedicab chase sequence and various dangerous looking jumps and twisting bodies flying through the air and crushing with force to the hard destination . still the film makers seem not to  accept  the violence of the film as sammo is  like the late bruce lee  willing to give himself up after the final murderous mayhem at the gangster villa  and i think this kind of morale  no matter how obvious or shallow it may be  is a good thing even in a harmless film like this  as cinema is meant to be much more than just brainless entertainment .  br    br   the film has also some very witty bits of humor that i  m not sure everyone in hollywood or america  for example  would understand or like at all . the hilarious star wars gag at the beginning is definitely among these and it literally forced me to laugh when i realized what i was seeing . also some funny scenes are created out of sammo  s passion for ping . still  the greatest amazement  filled laugh came during the scenes depicted in the former pharagraph as the imagery of big and tall men flying with great force over the screen to the walls or furniture is simply insane and so breathtaking i just cannot hide my feelings and thoughts about these eastern film makers when i witness something like this  and this is nothing but positive and appreciating reaction  of course .  br    br   pedicab driver is among the most incredible hong kong action films that i have ever seen and easily among sammo  s greatest achievements . if the few minor flaws were not there  this could rate even brighter and higher .      ,1
you wouldn  t expect a movie like this to be good  and it isn  t . it  s a no budget  ultra violent zombie movie filmed with a bad looking hand  held camera . . . and it  s hilarious . the actors obviously have never acted before and it shows in their terrible hilarious readings . there is no plot to be seen . the little plot i could find seemed to be that a government experiment escaped and a group of zombie seems to be terrorizing a couple families . the gore effects are actually some of the most sickening i  ve ever seen . it seems the gore effects people raided a butcher shop for all the body parts  and many scenes involve zombies dismembering people and eating their organs . it  s a funny and sickening film  and it  s about as bad as you can get in terms of any movie .  br    br   my rating bomb   .   mins .  ,0
there have been some low moments in my life  when i have been bewildered and depressed . sitting through rancid aluminium was one of these .  br    br   the warning signs were there . no premiere  even the stars didn  t want to attend  and no reviews in magazines . the only reason i sat through the film was in the hope that i might catch up on some sleep .  br    br   nothing in the film was explained . the narration was idiotic . i cheered at one point when the lead of the film appeared to have been shot  then to my growing despair  it was revealed that he hadn  t really been shot dampening my joy . i sincerely hope all involved in the film are hanged for this atrocity .  br    br   there were some positive aspects  mainly unintentional moments of humour . for example  the scene in which the main character  for some unknown reason feels the need to relieve himself manually in a toilet cubicle  while telling the person in the next cubicle to put his fingers in his ears .  br    br   my words cannot explain the anger i feel  so i shall conclude thus .  br    br   rancid aluminium for sadists  wastrels  and regressives only who want to torture themselves .  ,0
there is no reason to see this movie . a good plot idea is handled very badly . in the middle of the movie everything changes and from there on nothing makes much sense . the reason for the killings are not made clear . the acting is awful . nick stahl obviously needs a better director . he was excellent in in the bedroom  but here he is terrible . amber benson from buffy  has to change her character someday . even those of you who enjoy gratuitous sex and violence will be disappointed . even though the movie was   minutes  which is too short for a good movie  but too long for this one   there are no deleted scenes in the dvd which means they never bothered to fill in the missing parts to the characters .  br    br   don  t spend the time on this one .  ,0
this movie is a brilliant lesson on japanese history set in at the end of the tokugawa shogunate shortly before the shogunate lost a big battle against the loyalist  who wanted the emperor back on the throne to rule japan . really  i had to read a lot of history to get the entire background .  br    br   shintaro katsu  also known as the original zatoichi  gives a superb performance as izo okada  one of the four hitokiri  human slayer  of the bakumatsu . he is a simple samurai who looses all of his wealth . in order to have a good life he becomes a retainer of takechi hanpei  played by tatsuya nakada  ryonosuke out of sword of doom  . hanpei is a ultra  nationalist politician who lets his band of hitokiri assassinate a lot of high ranking pro  west politicians in order to achieve his political goals . izo okada follows his leader without really questioning what they are doing . as long as he has money to go and drink and spend at his whore . okada  s killings get more and more brutal in the course of the movie and he is proud to have a reputation based on fear wherever he goes .  br    br   it is a splendid portrait on the life of a simple samurai who gets caught up in political affairs and is really to naive to realize what is happening . first after being betrayed and tortured and always having talks with sakamoto  who is a samurai who rejects violence  does he change his ideas and views on life . but too late . . . .  br    br   watch the movie to see the end of izo okada . . .  br    br   shintaro katsu and the rest of the staff give a brilliant performance . each actor reaches up to their role . the sword  fights a very unique and fast . . . probably faster than several movies nowadays . . .  br    br   check it out if you have the chance     ,1

spoilers ahead if you want to call them that . . .  br    br   i would almost recommend this film just so people can truly see a     . where to begin  we  ll start from the top . . .  br    br   the story don  t believe the premise  the movie has nothing to do with abandoned cars  and people finially understanding what the mysterious happenings are . it  s a draub  basic  go to cabin movie with no intensity or  effort  .  br    br   the screenplay i usually give credit to indie screenwriters  it  s hard work when you are starting out . . . but this is crap . the story is flat  it leaves you emotionless the entire movie . the dialogue is extremely weak and predictable boasting lines of  woah  you totally freaked me out  and  i was wondering if you  d uh . . . if you  d like to . . uh  would you come to the cabin with me   . it makes me want to rip out all my hair  one strand at a time and feed it to myself .  br    br   the characters holy crap     some have described the characters as flat  i want to take it one step further and say that they actually have a reverse character arch . . they actually start working on a parallel universe and almost start acting backwards . . .  br    br   the actors worse than the characters are the actors . they take already poor written characters and add in terrible high school drama acting . the  woah you totally freaked me out  was said so monotone and slow  like it was dumbed down . i could complain for hours on the actors alone .  br    br   technical lighting an eight year old would be disappointed with lighting on this movie . too shadowy in areas  too bleached in others . the director shouldn  t use light as an emotion until he learns how to light a basic scene properly . baby steps  sound how many sound guys does it take to make a really shotty sounding movie   . with that many sound guys this should sound amazing but quite the opposite has occured . there is one scene in particular that really sticks out  these guys are driving in a car and the sound of the car changes with every camera angle . . . . weak  camera learn to use it .  br    br   anyway  i  m running out of complaining space . . . . . rent it  i dare you . . . rent it and learn from it . . . give it a  rating . . it deserves it .  br    br   signing off . . . amanda christmas  ,0
some people have made a point of dissing this movie because they question the plausibility of black people in the old west  asian people in the old west or women with guns in the old west period . get a grip and read a book . there were quite a few asians  chinese   there were quite a few blacks  freedmen  and everybody outside of the gentile class had ready access to guns it is the second amendment you know . and as far as the use of modern language goes  none of those westerns people have waxed nostalgic about actually used language that was consistent with the era depicted . americans had different accents  used different inflections  spoke at a very different pace and used plenty of words and phrases that would be unrecognizable today . don  t blame historical inaccuracy for the fact that you just didn  t dig it . be honest . maybe you  re just uncomfortable with what you  re seeing .  ,0
nobody said movies had to be realistic did they  i really liked this movie because i remember when i first saw it in junior high . for all the kids who remember the pmrc and albums before there were warning stickers  it  s a cool story for all those kids who were part of the mid to late    s headbanger crowd .  ,1
this is one of the most daring and important of the so  called  pre  code  films made in hollywood during the     s . unlike some pre  code films that occasionally dabbled in subjects that would have never been allowed after        this film fully immersed itself in a very sordid yet entertaining plot from start to finish . the conventional morality of the late   s and   s was definitely not evident in this film  as the film is essentially about a conniving woman who sleeps her way to the top   and with no apologies along the way . this  broad  both enjoyed sex and used it on every man who could help her get rich   something you just never would have seen in films made just two or three years later .  br    br   the film begins with barbara stanwyck working in her father  s speakeasy . in addition to being her boss  he is also her pimp and encourages her to sleep with a local government official so that he  ll allow the illegal bar to operate with impunity . while not especially clear here  it appears as if daddy has been  renting  his daughter  s body out for a long time .  br    br   however  after nearly being raped and attacking this man by breaking a bottle of beer over his skull  barbara has had enough and heads to the big city . it doesn  t hurt that the still blew up and killed her father  but her feeling that she was whoring herself out and had nothing to show for it appeared to be the impetus to move .  br    br   despite the depression  barbara uses sex to get a job at a huge mega  bank . she starts out at a pretty menial job as a file clerk  but in the space of what seems like just a few weeks  she sleeps her way from one job to another to yet another   until she is sleeping with the head of the bank and his future son  in  law    this all ends in tragedy  but babs doesn  t seem too shook up over the deaths of these two men . in fact  some time later  she is able to insinuate herself into the life of the new ceo and once again she  s on top  perhaps in more way than one  .  br    br   now so far  this is a wonderful movie because it was so gritty and unrepentant . barbara played a     sociopath   a woman with no morality and no conscience   just a desire to squeeze as much out of life as she could no matter who she hurt in the process . however  the brave writers and producer  chickened out  and thought it important to tack on a redemptive ending . considering that this woman was so evil and conniving  her change of heart at the end was a major disappointment and strongly detracted from the film . in many ways  this reminded me of the ending of jezebel   as once again  a wicked person somehow  sees the light  and changes at the not  too  convincing conclusion .  br    br   my advice is to try watching red  headed woman and downstairs . red  headed woman is much like baby face but features no magical transformation at the end   the leading lady really is a skunk down deep  in downstairs  a film very much like red  headed woman  the roles are reversed and a man  john gilbert  plays a similar conniving character . both are classics and a bit better than this film .  br    br   this film is an amazing curio of a brief period of often ultra  sleazy hollywood films and in this light it  s well worth seeing for cinephiles . also  fans of the duke take note   john wayne plays a very small part in the film and it  s very unusual to see a very young wayne playing such a conventional role .  ,1
the world at war is one of the best documentaries about world war  .  br    br   the   episodes cover the war and what it was like in the countries involved in it . the first episode tells us how the hitler came to power  and how he was able to build up one of the strongest armies in the world . they also fucus on the military actions taken during the war  and the holocaust . one of the strongest and best documentaries ever made . all of you must watch this . perfection        br    br    ,1
paulie sounds like the most saccharine  lachrymose and sentimental garbage you could ever find  yet it  s actually much better than you might expect . the daftness of the plot could so easily have set the tone for the whole film  but actually in most other departments the film is charming .  br    br   in case you  re wondering  paulie is a parrot . bought for a little girl with speech difficulties  paulie becomes her best friend and goes everywhere with her . he even sits on her shoulder during speech therapy lessons  and eventually becomes a super  intelligent speaker himself . however  paulie is sent away by the little girl  s mother and he spends the rest of the film trying to get from n . y . c to l . a to be re  united with her .  br    br   so  why does this awful  sounding film succeed relatively well  firstly  it boasts some interesting and impressive animatronic effects . secondly  and far more significantly  it has the courage to embrace its ludicrous premise and tells a genuinely moving  often humourous story without worrying too much about the obvious flaws in the storyline . thirdly  it has several surprisingly strong performances  including jay mohr as a wily crook  gena rowlands as a kind old lady  and cheech marin  yes  the dope  smoking cheech marin   as a musical immigrant . it might not be a classic  but paulie is sound entertainment for kids of all ages .  ,1
alright  this film is the representation of several things . for starters  this film is about a disgruntled student who brings a gun to school and shoots roughly  students . one student survives and is in the hospital with extensive head injuries . the lead character is what several people who consider a  loner  goth   despite the movie  s stating of her not being so . she seems quite mysterious  but was also the only unharmed student in the victimized classroom . she  s questioned  due to having a history of knowing the shooter and having a record of being on the phone with him the night before . anyhow  she  s a very brief and distant person who seems to despise society . yet  due to some  at first unexplained events  she spent roughly a year out of school  failing the grade . she has the desire to graduate  and the principle practically cons her into the only possible way she can pass is to spend time with the survivor  the girl in the hospital .  br    br   these two leads are nearly entirely opposite  and they are quite that on a social level . while alisha is a quiet  inwardly disturbed  anti  social  goth  girl who spends her time entirely alone  even though she seems to read quite often  somewhat of a closet  out of the closet bookworm   the other girl is a rich  popular  bubbly  girl who seems always incredibly optimistic and trapped in her own fantasy world  ignoring the outside world and its realism to survive . i feel both of these roles to a marvelous job of representing most  cliques  in the modern highschool  but more importantly shows how two entirely opposite girls who know nothing of each other eventually open to each other . while the injured girl learns a deep  meaningful truth on her once sheltered life and the outside world  alisha learns that complete abandonment of society and locking everything inside is not always the best thing .  br    br   many people will look to the connection between these two girls and see one of two things . either  a snobby  hateful girl who wants he rest of the world to suffer as she does  taking it out on an innocent girl  or the story of a seemingly trapped  fantasized girl who meets an outcast to society and learns not only not to judge  but that she is actually  perhaps  one of the most intelligent people she  s known . in other words  people may see this film as a focus on alisha teaching the other girl a lesson about life  but it isn  t about that .  br    br   this film is about several things . while it is about all i have stated  it is also representative of how people deal from a large  life  changing catastrophe . truly  this movie is not very symbolic  but instead incredibly straight forward with its message  as long as you aren  t afraid to open your mind  and your heart  to some emotions you may not be familiar with being portrayed so miraculously .  br    br   overall  this film is one of the best i  ve ever seen . the acting is brilliant  the storyline and representation is deep and meaningful  and the emotion flowing through  out this film will have anyone not only relating  but possibly crying . this film is by far heart  wrenching  and very impactful  and if i ever believed any film could alter a person  s life . . . this would be the first that could have changed mine .  br    br   i adored this movie  if you ever want a movie that  s moving and impactful  while incredibly entertaining and real  watch this .  ,1
my name is modesty is a low  budget film that tells the story of the origins of modesty blaise . it  s not that the movie is terrible  it  s just not what i was expecting or hoping for . while i  ve been aware of the modesty blaise character for years  i  m not overly familiar with the comic strips or the graphic novels  so i  m coming into this movie as something as an outsider . that may be part of the reason for my disappointment . i was expecting more action and more comedy . the film is dialogue driven . i suppose i was looking for something with a little more camp value . as it is  my name is modesty is a deathly serious film . there are very few  if any   light  moments . the acting  at least from alexandra staden  is acceptable but nothing outstanding . as others have commented  she does appear a little too frail to be completely believable in the title role . what action scenes there are in my name is modesty are one of the films weakest points . i never bought into the notion that this woman could handle a band of trained killers .  br    br   i really hope quentin tarantino goes ahead and makes the rumored a big budget film based on the modesty blaise character . i  m convinced the concept has a lot of potential and i would very much look forward to it .  ,0
well it  s not often that we in the uk have a film made about inner city life from the perspective of the afro caribbean community  the last example that i can remember was the underrated babylon way back in     . so i had high expectations when i heard about bullet boy  a film that has been touted as the british version of la haine  well la haine it is not  i agree that the use of dialogue and environment gives this film an authenticity that has been missed in other british films of late  but my concern is that this film predictably ends sadly .  br    br   the film intelligently deals with the escalating problem of black on black violence that is sadly all to common in london  but i  m concerned that film makers now use type  casting in plot as opposed to characters which is equally as damaging . saul dibb had a great opportunity to make a film that could be both entertaining and inspirational to us all  but sadly missed and created a film that only reinforces the idea that to be a young black male in london the only future is violence  tragedy  ,0
a doctor who is trying to complete the medical dream of transplantation is experimenting secretly on corpses from the hospital with varying success . his final best chance comes when he lovingly wraps his girlfriend  s head in his jacket as he rescues it from a burning vehicle .  br    br   i was looking for cheese and with this premise i believed i found it . it has everything everything that bad movie hunters look for  chest and brain surgery with the surgeons leaving with pristine white scrubs  unique camera angles  i always love watching the rear passenger wheels of cars   cheesy clarinet stripper music  and one of the longest death scenes in movie history . but unfortunately these so  bad  they  are  good moments can  t overcome the too  bad  they  stink stretches .  br    br   jan in the pan annoyed me  with her droning monologues in a hoarse whisper  the somewhat less than evil laughter  and the fact she was kept alive with some columbian home brew coffee and  dd batteries .  br    br   i couldn  t even entertain myself with dr bill  s horrid overacting and moral self righteousness . usually such ham makes these movies a must see in my opinion  in this case i was bored with it .  br    br   the best part of the movie in my opinion was the      s version of  body shopping  and i even found myself nodding off during that .  br    br   don  t spend money on this one  there are better bad movies out there to entertain your sick sense of humor .  ,0
yeah  the archetype of a simple but inspirational movie . the very end when the entire crowd in the stadium gets up and the people raise their hands gives me a chill whenever i see it . that  s just brilliant . joseph is wonderful as the lonely and sad kid who has so far been disappointed by anyone and anything in his life . the way he interacts with danny glover and tries to make him believe in the magic and the angels is funny and exhilarating . a very nice family movie with  i concede  a rather corny happy end . but hey  it doesn  t really matter  the movie retains its basic quality by the good acting and the inspirational themes .  ,1
star trek hidden frontier will surprise you in many ways . first  it  s a fan made series  available only on the web  and it features mainly friends  neighbors who have the computer programs and home video cameras and sewing machines to  as mickey  judy once put it  put on a show . it  s definitely friends  neighbors to  you can tell . a lot of these people aren  t the most beautiful looking folks you  ve ever seen  or the youngest  or the thinnest some of them stumble through their lines like they  re walking on marbles some of them have thick accents  or simply don  t seem to speak well in the first place  whick makes it virtually impossible to understand a single solitary word that they  re saying . still  you have to admit  for everything these friends  neighbors have put together  it  s actually fun to watch . yes  some of the dialogue is hokey . yes  it  s a little odd  though admittedly a little cool too  watching two starfleet males kiss  although some of the kissing scenes seem to go on and on .  yes  you cringe a bit when they clearly quote from sttos  tng  other shows and the movies  or when you hear the theme from galaxy quest played at the beginning and end of every show . okay . we can get by that . why  the graphics are first rate . better than almost anything you  ve seen . and sometimes  a show or two really stands out story  wise some of them are actually real tear  jerkers .  br    br   hidden frontier is a total guilty pleasure in every sense of the word but you have to give the people involved credit where credit is due . it takes a lot of effort to put on a production of this magnitude . people  sets  costumes  graphics it  s a huge effort on a lot of people  s parts . we watch  we return  and we thank them .  ,1
this movie feels so empty . in every scene in the movie the maximum number of actors on the screen is like   . because everything was shot in front of a blue screen there are never really any extras and the movie just feels weird .  br    br   the acting was horrible  it  s so obvious this was in front of a blue screen because all of the action scenes you can see the actor  actress wondering around half running when they should be running for their lives . . looking at the floor for their marks . . .  br    br   spoilers also you  ll find yourself banging your head watching the movie . at one point at sky captain  s home base they have like    planes sitting on the airstrip . they have advanced warning an attack is coming . . . so what do they do  nothing . all of the planes get blown up and yet again the only person fighting back is the sky captain . . .  br    br   the entire world is under attack and he  s the only person ever fighting back . at the very end of the movie you see hundreds of plains taking off finally . . . but what do they do  nothing . . . the movie is over . . .  ,0
this is the worst movie i have ever seen . i was going to get up and leave at tape  but i stuck it out . i now consider myself a masochist  afghanistan  come on guys  who  s the idiot who forgot to hide the sanskrit billboards  i thought the lead actor  george calil  was particularly inept . apart from the bad acting and over zealous camera shake  i thought using the events of     as a reason to make  larson the lunatic implodes  all over a screen near you  disgraceful and irreverent to the victims of     . using a phone call from larson  s wife  sarah  supposedly from one of the terrorist held planes on that day  was appalling . the camera shake didn  t make me feel sick  that cold hearted stunt did .  ,0
this movie is well done on so many levels that i am in awe that the score is as low as it is   .         votes  as of this writing  . this movie has incredible special effects  a true epic storyline  complex great character interaction  and mind  blowing battles  they have to be seen to be believed  the only complaint i have is the subtitles on the hk dvd version i got  some lines were not translated      .  br    br   i just don  t understand when i read  hear from various sources  it has a confusing plot . . . .    i couldn  t follow the story . . . .  or  characters came from nowhere . . .  . from the very  st time i watched this movie  i understood it  followed it  knew why characters were there  and i absolutely loved it  i  ve watched it about  times already and each time it is pure enjoyment . oh  and this is not just my opinion  because i  ve shown this movie to many fellow americans  people who have never seen an hk film before  who feel the same way . not one of them failed to follow the storyline and each person declared their love for this movie . oh man  why can  t we have stuff like this coming out of hollywood  at least lord of the rings had a nice marriage of special effects  character development  and storyline .  br    br   this is not coming from a asian film lover newbie either . i own an extensive library of asian films and i must say that this movie is one of my greatest dvds . when you watch it you will be blown away by the amazing special effects and epic feel of this movie . you will be drawn into this fantasy world and you won  t want to leave  i  ve seen both the     version and the      both done by tsui hark   and the     is far better in comparison imo .  br    br   besides the subtitles  i have one additional complaint about this movie i didn  t want it to end . . . . i  m begging you mr . hark  can we please have a sequel   ,1
this series could very well be the best britcom ever  and that is saying a great deal  considering the competitors  fawlty towers  good neighbours  to name just two  .  br    br   what made butterflies so superior  even to the best of the best  is that it did not just exemplify great  classic  classy and intelligent comedy  but it also expanded horizons  reflecting  flawlessly  gently  and at every detail  the great social change that was occurring in britain at the time .  br    br   i remember watching this show as a teenager and being in awe of everything about it . the lifestyle depicted was remarkable in itself . this was the first time i saw real people using cordless phones . and the wardrobe of all the characters was far removed from the goofy seventies attire still seen in north america at the time . then there were the decors  shop fronts  cars . these people  even the layabout sons  with their philosophical approach to life and epigrammatic humor  were sophisticated . they were examples of the  new europeans  that would come to have an impact on life and style throughout the world in the coming decade      s  .  br    br   of course  the premise was strange and fantastic . the idea that someone who was living the suburban dream could be so discontent and restless was revolutionary  particularly to north americans for whom happiness was always defined as money and things  sure the situation was depicted in american movies and tv  but not with the intensity of butterflies or the movie montenegro  . and  if the premise was not surprising enough  the means by which it was expressed took it to the extreme . a potential affair that was not really about sex  or even romance  butterflies dazzled many  but it must have left some people smacking their foreheads in disbelief . . . at the time anyway .  br    br   butterflies turned out to be  in so many ways  prophetic . it documented  ahead of its time  post  modern ennui  all  pervasive lifestyle  the notion of emotional infidelity  and generational disconnect and male discontent  portrayed perfectly by the strained father  son relationships  . it is too bad this series has not been rediscovered in a big way  and all those involved given credit for creating a meaningful snapshot of a certain time and place  and foreseeing all the slickness and angst that was to come .  ,1
this movie had so much potential . anyone who followed the story of jeffrey knows that there are so many details overlooked in this movie it  s ridiculous . too much time and effort was spent in the movie on dahmer  s homosexual tendencies and his alcohol consumption . where was the character development  the origins of any villain are always interesting and dahmer was no exception . where in the movie does it address his adolescence when he began killing and mutilating small animals  instead we are giving a dizzying array of flashbacks that seek to explain the origin of the killer  but fail to address the major point in dahmer  s development . also  the reason why the country became so intrigued with this story was the details  how he stored the bodies in his apartment and the lengths and measures he went to to accomplish this his cannibalism and his desire for flesh  etc . i could go on  but to sum up  too many lagging points in the film  focused on his sexuality and not enough of the gore  the good stuff you would expect to see when the title of the movie is  dahmer .   ,0
a vow to cherish is a wonderful movie . it  s based on a novel of the same title  which was equally good  though different from the film . really made you think about how you  d respond if you were in the shoes of the characters . recommended for anyone who has ever loved a parent  spouse  or family member   in other words  everyone   br    br   though the production isn  t quite hollywood quality   no big special effects   still  the values and ideals portrayed more than make up for it . and the cast did a wonderful job of capturing the emotional connections between family members  and the devastation that occurs when one of them becomes ill .  br    br   you don  t want to miss this   ,1
so many educational films are nothing more than mind  numbing drudgery  saved only by the fact that  mst  k  mocks them   why study industrial arts   comes to mind  .  hemo the magnificent  is actually quite well done . it  s all about blood  the heart  and the circulatory system . i admit that i don  t remember everything from it  but it does a good job explaining everything  keeping it serious but entertaining . i guess that you can always count on june foray  most famously the voice of rocky the squirrel  she plays a deer here  .  br    br   since  hemo the magnificent  itself may be hard to find  probably the best place to see it is in  gremlins   a class is watching it while a gremlin is forming .  ,1

just like last years event wwe new years revolution     was headlined by an elimination chamber match . the difference between last years and this years match however was the entertainment value . in reality only three people stood a chance of walking out of the pepsi arena in albany  new york with the wwe championship . those men were current champion john cena  kurt angle and shawn michaels . there was no way vinnie mac would put the belt on any of the rookies carlito or chris masters . and kane  kane last held the wwe championship in june      and that was only for one night . it was obvious he wasn  t going to be the one either . last years match was a thrilling affair with six of the best wwe had to offer .     was a predictable and disappointing affair but still the match of the night by far .  br    br   the only surprise of the evening came after the bell had run on the main event . out strolled vince mcmahon himself and demanded they lift the chamber . it was then announced that edge was cashing in his money in the bank championship match right then and there . with no time to prepare and just off the back of winning the elimination chamber match john cena did not stand a chance and dropped the title after a spear to one of the most entertaining heels in wwe . this was the only entertaining piece of action that happened all night .  br    br   the undercard  like last year  was truly atrocious . triple h and the big show put on a snore fest that had me struggling to stay away . hhh picked up the win but that was never in any real doubt was it  any pay  per  view that has both jerry lawler and viscera wrestling on the same card will never have any chance of becoming a success really does it . the king pinned helms  who books this stuff   and big vis tasted defeat against the wasted shelton benjamin with a little help from his mama .  br    br   the women of the wwe also had a busy night . there was the usual diva nonsense with a bra and panties gauntlet match which was won by ashley and the woman  s championship was also on the line . in a match  i thought would have been left to brew till wrestlemania   mickie james challenged trish stratus in a good match . trish won the contest but it was evident that this is going to continue for the foreseeable future .  br    br   the opening contest of the night pitted soon to be wwe champion edge against intercontinental champion  ric flair . this could have been better but it was a battered and bloody flair that retained after a disqualification finish . edge obviously had bigger fish to fry .  br    br   so new years revolution kicked off the     pay  per  view calendar in disastrous fashion . the only good thing from that is knowing that for the wwe the only way is up . they don  t get much worse than this .  ,0
i decided to watch this one because it  s been nominated for oscar this year . i guess as many folks here i really wanted to like this movie  but ended up bored and disappointed . first scene was ok but the whole rest of the movie in  shaky hands  camera mode is really annoying .  br    br   i guess the main reason for making such a movie and nominating it for oscar is this  br    br   american  military machine   people  who makes money on war  urgently need an excuse or justification of war in iraq by bungling up something  sort of  patriotic .  br    br   why these  heroic  efforts of director and the main character to  inspire  the audience with an idea of  loving  war  like  a  drug   . . oh  please  come on  what a bore   br    br   watch this to get an idea of how low the movie academy can fall . . .  ,0

i caught this film at the edinburgh film festival . i hadn  t heard much about it only that it was a tightly  paced thriller  shot digitally on a very low budget . i was hoping to catch the next big brit  flick . but i have to say  i was severely disappointed .  this is not a love song  follows two criminals  who  after accidentally shooting and killing a farmer  s young daughter  become embroiled in a deadly game of cat and mouse when the locals decide to take matters into their own hands and hunt them down .  br    br   the real problem is that this is yet another example of style over substance in a british film . the camera angles and editing are completely at odds with the story  as are the over the top performances  and the appalling use of slow motion  which only serves to make the whole thing look like an expensive home video . there are repeated attempts to make the film look edgy and gritty  which instead come over as hilarious and over the top  cue a pathetic  obligatory drug scene  and countless  pointless camera zooms  . no amount of cliche  s such as this can disguise the fact that this is a pretty bad story .  br    br   we  ve seen this kind of thing many times before  and made a hundred times better  particularly in john boorman  s masterful  deliverance .  but while in the latter film  we actually cared about the characters  in this film  i found myself just wanting them to be hunted down and killed as quickly as possible . even this wouldn  t have been so bad if their adversaries had been frightening or worthwhile  but instead  are merely a collection of stereotypical  inbred  looking countryfolk . again  another offensive  overused cliche  coming to the fore . surely there are some nice people in the country  filmmakers   br    br   in its defense   this is not a love song  does contain a couple of good  suspenseful moments  but it  s hard to see this film doing anything other than going straight to video  or  at a push  getting a very limited cinema release . it  s not a patch on last year  s low  budget hunted in the hills movie   dog soldiers  . maybe british cinema could actually get kick  started again if the right money stopped going to the wrong people .  ,0
i love this episode of columbo . maybe it  s because ruth gordon is in it and she is wonderful as successful mystery writer abigail mitchell  an american version of dame agatha christie . she is delicious to watch as the perky  lovable author who suffered a terrible loss when her niece died in a drowning accident . she blames her niece  s husband  the nephew . she plans to kill him to avenge her death since the police have abandoned her . i would have loved somebody else than mariette hartley to play veronica . i never really like hartley in anything personally . and of course with columbo  there are some laughs like when he questions veronica at a belly  dancing class . ruth  s abigail is a smart sleuth herself and she matches wits with columbo always played wonderfully by peter falk .  ,1
a very silly movie  this starts with a soft porn sequence  ventures into farcelike comedy in the art gallery  adds a shocker of a discovery in the hotel room then introduces a random murder for no obvious reason .  br    br   what follows is bizarre and surreal  the stopwatch scene in particular is exquisitely unnecessary   culminating in a revelatory  twist  ending which is as obvious as it is unfair on the viewer  see the trivia section for precisely why it  s deliberately unfair  .  br    br   the movie goes out of its way to be offensive to as many groups as possible  transsexuals  the insane  and the wonderful  huggie bear   style racial stereotyping on the subway  and condescendingly treats the viewer like an idiot in the closing scenes  as characters endlessly explain to one another in great detail and over and over again what just happened in the film . though the background female characters in the restaurant scene at the end are a joy to watch .  br    br   in fact  the whole movie is a joy to watch despite its many  many flaws  the whole package just  well  works .  ,1
the good news is a movie was made  drawing on a supposed aztec myth and featuring an unusually aztec  american  is such a word exists  cast . the bad news is  it was dead at birth .  br    br   if ed wood had come out of retirement and coached george romaro through his classic  night of the living dead   this is what we might have come up with .  the legend of diablo  is clearly fodder for any future resurrections of  mystery science theatre        br    br   i don  t think one can even call this a  b  movie . the production values are so abysmal that i kept getting the feeling i was watching either a lengthy skit from a variety show or a backyard   mm film shot by a group of school kids .  br    br   some spoilers  br    br   the basic plot line sounded interesting enough to lure me into renting it . a rural california sheriff finds a box containing an aztec demon and accidentally unleashes it on the unsuspecting community . his daughters  one hot and one homely  team with a gringo fbi man and a priest  to try to re  cage the demon .  br    br   meanwhile  every zombie scene one has ever seen in previous undead movies is re  enacted  poorly . these zombies walk more like an army of nutty professors than the undead  the supposed infrared scenes from the demon  s viewpoint are nothing special  and he  she  it sure seems to back up a lot  as opposed to turning around the moving forward  . and the scene where the priest lures the demon out of the cave in fast  motion is ludicrous  it really  really appears to be done for comic effect  although i know it wasn  t  i kept expecting the benny hill theme music to start playing  for the whole gang of zombies to start chasing the priest all over the beach   br    br   of course the darth vader  field of dreams voice  calling the fbi agent becomes downright comical . then again  so was most of this cheese ball  robert napton  director and writer of the screenplay  should win something for this effort   how about a lifetime blackballing  like the  hollywood      this one  i now see  is rated  .  on a    scale . i fear this might be a tad generous   br    br   is there anything good about this movie  well  lindsey lofaso looks pretty hot as the younger daughter of the dead sheriff . this is probably why her homely older sister  calvi pabon  really ran away from home  fred estrado is reasonably decent as the fbi agent . i wonder if mario soto  who played father rodriguez  is the same mario soto who pitched for the cincinnati reds  if so  he should have stuck to baseball . in fact  they couldn  t have done any worse if they had gone with a baseball theme and called it  demons in the outfield    br    br   if i find out this was actually a project for a community college cinema class  i will issue apologies . it might be good enough for a b or even b as long as the gang got the college  s camcorder back to campus in one piece   the blair witch project  proved that a cool  campy movie could be made on a shoestring .  the legend of diablo   though  didn  t appear to have a shoestring or shoes to work from  it was low  budget  low  talent  low  everything . the very final scene  and i mean about the final   seconds of the film  is the only mildly creative or interesting moment .  br    br   i paid   .   to rent this . i could have better spent it on a hamburger   ,0
my teacher taped this and showed it to us in child care to demonstrate how teen pregnancy affects people . it just demonstrated how teen pregnancy affects a childish jock not properly educated on how sex works and a whiny  unloved girl who throws fruit when angry and couldn  t tell she was with the wrong man even if he wore a sign stating he was such . i wouldn  t be surprised if the father of the baby had about eight girlfriends in the first edition of the script . stacy  s  the carrier of the baby  mother is a riot . she is oblivious to the fact her daughter is past the age of four and is seemingly unshaken when people spy on her through her dining room window . bobby  s  the father  best friend  s name is dewey  and is an obvious rip off of sean penn  s character in fast times at ridgemont high . this movie is horrid  simply because none of the characters are believable . thank goodness it  s only made for tv  limiting the public  s chances of viewing it .  ,0
the movie deserves     .  .  stars for the girl   i  m sorry i  m biased  i think pretty girl is the only highlight of the movies   and  .  for the fact that it is shorter than azumi  . i watched azumi  and  in  seating . i amazed myself being able to sit through it .  br    br   lets talk about the plus points of the movie . the girl . ueto aya is cute . thats all there is to salvage the whole movie . the fact is  if the main character was male  i am sure that most people  including me  would not have touched the movie at all .  br    br   now lets talk about the minus points . firstly  it is real draggy  with lots and lots of repeated scenes . scenes of nachi and azumi keeps coming back . it seems more like a drama way of shooting . typical japanese dramas love flashbacks  and this movie too . secondly  the movie is too unrealistic in a historical setting . i do not mind unrealistic movies . but this movie is like a poor way of showing creativeness  by throwing in ninjas that act like bears and spider webs  etc . . . it reminds me of shinobi  though shinobi is a movie with a fantasy setting . moreover  to portray  i  don  t  know  what effect  the director films people dying with blood spraying  literally  all around . . . people not realizing their head was cut off . . . etc . . etc . . . etc . . . too many of these spoils the show . it seems like the anime influence is strong in this movie . it degrades the show greatly . thirdly  isn  t azumi supposed to be an assassin . she seems more like an one  man  army to me  just that she is a female . i don  t think you see assassins charging into army camps . the only time i felt she acted  assassin  liked  was when she killed the kiyomasa kato at the end of azumi  . lastly  the plot was thin in both movies . its a linear plot with no development and surprises in any way .  ,0
otto preminger  completing a noir cycle at twentieth century fox  reunited his  laura  leads for this stark  gritty detective drama . dana andrews again portrays a cop  but this time he  s hardened  cynical and has been accused of police brutality by his superior   you don  t hate hoods  you liked to beat them up   . mark dixon  andrews  despises criminals  as his own father was a crook . he doesn  t want to be  sandy dixon  s kid  so he became a policeman  but his methods are harsh and hated .  br    br   one night  investigating a murder  he unknowingly punches a suspect  ken paine  craig stevens  so hard that it kills him . a shaken dixon does his best to cover it up  intending to frame a hated thug  scalise  gary merrill  for the crime . however  the blame falls on paine  s father  in  law  jiggs taylor  tom tully   whose daughter  department store model morgan taylor  tierney  is estranged from her husband but keeps getting drawn into his gambling schemes . paine had slapped his wife  enraging her father  who did show up at his son  in  law  s apartment  but not until dixon had departed with the body . with no better suspects  jiggs is arrested and charged .  br    br   riddled with guilt  mark falls for morgan and offers money for an attorney . he decides to take on scalise anyway but leaves a letter to be given to the department in the event of his death  confessing everything . in the end  he cannot live with the knowledge with what he has done  and he permits the letter to be read by his superior and by morgan . despite all the tragic circumstances  morgan professes her love for mark and will wait for him .  br    br   it was great to find this film on dvd  after so many years of televised obscurity . eddie mueller  a film noir historian  provides the commentary and does a good job  but i find his assertion that audiences wouldn  t have caught the significance of the casting of the two leads  since  laura  had been made six years earlier . in that respect  he is mistaken because they had appeared in  the iron curtain  two years prior to wtse and the film was a box  office success .  br    br   andrews and tierney were fabulous together  and ruth donnelly is tremendous comic relief as restaurant owner martha  fanning the flames between the detective and the dame .  br    br   the night cityscapes give the film an air of menace . gary merrill is great as the low  life scalise  who had a criminal past with dixon  s dad   your father liked me   he taunts mark  . karl malden and a young neville brand are terrific also . and tom tully is just touching and funny as morgan  s unjustly accused pop .  br    br   a watchable film noir with a fantastic cast .  ,1
gentleman jim not really a boxing film . it is a vehicle for errol flynn as jim corbett . but having said that  the boxing scenes are a real eye  opener to the modern viewer . there are no   round  points decisions here .  br    br   errol flynn plays the irish bank clerk who gets a shot at the heavyweight world title . flynn is well suited to the role of suave but unpredictable corbett . his opponent john sullivan is still better however  a bruiser of the old school played by ward bond .  br    br   the theme of the film is a man pushing for his big chance . corbett leaves his mundane life behind and builds a new persona as gentleman jim . jim is a chancer who can adapt to any social environment . he is a liar and an egotist . sullivan the heavyweight boxing champion is portrayed as a simple brute but his honesty and sportsmanship gives a certain contrast to the main character .  br    br   there is action and excitement aplenty and a wonderful ending with the requisite redemption for all . and errol flynn gets the girl .  ,1
edmund lowe  who reminds me somewhat of warren william   heads the nice cast of an interesting little mystery that moves at a brisk pace and runs just a little over an hour .  br    br   douglas walton plays the unlucky jockey who appears to be intent on his own demise  hypnotism  anyone    and the suspects include a good number of the supporting cast   everyone from virginia bruce  kent smith  frieda inescourt  gene lockhart  jessie ralph  benita hume  rosalind ivan and h . b . warner . as an added bonus  there  s nat pendleton as a dimwit detective   and furthermore  get a load of that art deco set decoration for the fancy interiors of a wealthy home . must have been a set that was used in many a subsequent film .  br    br   on the plus side  the mystery is not so complicated that anyone can follow the plot with reasonable assurance of not being too baffled . it  s all suddenly clear to detective philo vance   and then he has a final confrontation with the murderer that gives the film a nifty five minutes of unmitigated suspense .  br    br   nicely done and passes the time in an entertaining manner .  ,1
this is truly terrible painfully irritating stylised performers screech and mug gratingly incoherent dialogues which take place in scenes which seem to have no purpose  no beginning  middle or end  cut together without any apparent narrative or even cognitive intention  all in the service of some entirely uninteresting and almost undetectable  story  . what makes it worse is the film  s pretentions to  style   suddenly a remote  head crane shot spirals downwards  and  without any apparent reason there are sudden whip  pans or wobblyhand  held sections all this  style  merely serves to magnify the almost unbelievably huge misconception of the project and the almost offensive vacuity of the material . definitely a candidate for the worst film ever made .  ,0
i remember when this was in theaters  reviews said it was horrible . well  i didn  t think it was that bad . it was amusing and had a lot of tongue  in  cheek humor concerning families around holiday time .  br    br   ben affleck is a rich guy who needs to find a family for christmas to please his girlfriend . he goes to visit the house he grew up in and strikes a deal to rent the family there for christmas . i really liked the lawyer scene where they sign a contract . that was funny .  br    br   so  he makes silly requests of the family and even writes scripts for them to read . of course  the family has a hot daughter for the love interest . and he learns that the holidays aren  t so bad after all .  br    br   also  the whole doo  dah act was funny  especially when they replaced the first one with a black guy  and the girlfriends  s parents didn  t even say anything about it . and the parts where doo  dah is hitting on his  supposed daughter .  final verdict i thought it  s worth checking out if you catch it on cable .  ,0
while being a great james arness western  this film has gone down as the worst alamo film ever made . the story was terrible  inaccuracy all through it  and just downright untruths to boot  continuity was cast to the four winds . anybody catch the cannon sequence  the mexicans were dumb enough to fire cannons that obviously had mud and ramrods still sticking out of the tubes . come on  then there is brian keith  s ridiculous hat  costumer must of been away or something . or just out of their mind   ,0
what an absolute pile of pants . having read chris brookmyre  s books religiously since i came across  quite ugly . . .   i was delighted to find out that this drama had been commissioned .  br    br   i obviously had too much faith .  br    br   nesbitt is probably the best thing in this show  and even he doesn  t quite fit . how anyone can read the book  and then adapt it to this piece of dross is beyond me .  br    br   entire characters are changed  situations are dropped  and to see parlablane  s dramatic break  in reduced to nesbitt doing a quick chin up and sliding open a bay window . . . it brought tears to my eyes .  br    br   i dread to think what  s going to happen with  country of the blind  if this is the benchmark . . .  br    br   please  just avoid it . . .  ,0
i really enjoyed this episode . seeing the flash  cyborg  green arrow  and aquaman  even though all he did was swim  made my eyes widen . to see most of the founders of the justice league trying to bring down lex luthor is what i  ve been waiting for . this sounds a bit off topic  but making a live action justice league show would definitely make me have a reason to shove everything that i usually do during the week down the drain just to watch one episode . this is the thrill i got from watching this episode . i wish they had made this episode a little longer  like a two hour special  because i felt that one hour of the justice league wasn  t enough . now before i bore you  unless i already have with my rambling  i just want to say  smallville is cool again . it sort of lost its touch when the show started focusing on lana . but i  m sure the writers will just fall back into that loop hole .   so enjoy this episode . who knows when another good one  s going to come out . catch it again this thursday  feb .    if you missed the first airing .  ,1
i think that most of the folks who have posted comments on this movie don  t understand how to watch a movie and  or have little sense of elegance . first  to assess a movie you need to understand the extent to which everything in the film works together . modern sensibilities demand great drama . no  i don  t mean great setting of characters and plots  but they seem to demand emotional trajectories that are greatly tragic or greatly comedic . this is a subtle movie . its beauty lies in its subtlety  not to be confused with simplicity  . neither the story nor the characters are simple in this movie . it is a beautifully filmed movie that makes the most of combining sensuousness  politics  human weakness  venality . . . you name it . the world it  s set in would be alien and not understood today . . . a world where if you have it you have to flaunt it now and loudly  even if you only think you have it .  br    br   many people today don  t understand that victorian society wasn  t really victorian as people understand that term today .  br    br   this movie helps set the record straight .  ,1
the only word i can think of to describe this movie is ordinary .  br    br   the plot line about gary sinise  s character attempting suicide is a ridiculous premise and c  mon . . living as some sort salingeristic hermit or recluse in a shack driving golf balls into the ocean because he couldn  t handle life in the lucrative pro  am golf community  cry me a river . i wish these were my problems . i do enjoy dylan baker and sinise but this movie was clearly a bad choice or a pay check for sinise . the scene in which little timmy price gets verbally abused by the other club member in front of his father during the tournament is so over the top that i am embarrassed to watch it  ,0

  hey babu riba  is a film about a young woman  mariana  nicknamed  esther  after a famous american movie star   and four young men  glenn  sacha  kicha  and pop  all perhaps      years old in     belgrade  yugoslavia . the five are committed friends and crazy about jazz  blue jeans  or anything american it seems .  br    br   the very close relationship of the teenagers is poignant  and ultimately a sacrifice is willingly made to try to help one of the group who has fallen on unexpected difficulties . in the wake of changing communist politics  they go their separate ways and reunite in      the year before the film was made  .  br    br   i enjoyed the film with some reservations . the subtitles for one thing were difficult . especially in the beginning  there were a number of dialogues which had no subtitles at all . perhaps the conversational pace required it  but i couldn  t always both read the text and absorb the scene  which caused me to not always understand which character was involved . i watched the movie  a video from our public library  with a friend  and neither of us really understood part of the story about acquiring streptomycin for a sick relative .  br    br   this yugoslavian coming of age film effectively conveyed the teenagers  sense of invulnerability  idealism  and strong and loyal bonds to each other . there is a main flashforward  and it was intriguing  keeping me guessing until the end as to who these characters were vis  a  vis the     cast  and what had actually happened .  br    br   i would rate it  out of    and would like to see other films by the director  jovan acin            .  ,1
this is one of the most spiritual movies i have ever seen . i headed up with about    people to st . george and we saw this movie in the visiting center of the st . george temple . . not one person had dry eyes in the audience . also  there were some non  religious and anti  mormon people in the audience who felt the spirit of the movie and were touched by the captivating music and reenactment of the story of the pioneers and the hardships they faced because of their beliefs .  br    br   i recommend this movie for anyone who wishes to understand more about joseph and the hardships that the pioneers went through . after all  it is apart of american history .  ,1
i had to watch this in school . and to sum it up . . .  br    br   talentless actors  talentless script  and a talentless director .  br    br   this movie is such a waste of your time . don  t even watch the movie . don  t bother . you will be so disappointed . my teacher said it was supposed to be good . how wrong she was . she even slept through it a little . the movie  s actors were just bad . the best actor in there was the old man and that  s not saying much . it  s has horrible plot with awful characters . so unrealistic and i can honestly said it had no point . the script was unemotional and confusing . there was points in the movie when i furrowed my brows and said   what   . also there were just too many loose ties and plot holes . it was just absolutely horrendous .  ,0
i hadn  t heard of this film until i read an article about it on the unknown movies website  which made me curious . as a cartoonist and illustrator myself  i  m an admirer of richard williams  s work  i rate ziggy  s gift as one of the finest christmas specials of all time  and even though who framed roger rabbit stopped being one of my favourite films when i got past the age of sixteen  i still have the highest of regard for the amount of work  care and attention to detail that went into creating the visuals  but it seems the man has his faults  most notably a propensity for going over budget and over schedule  and this film is a testament of just how far wrong even a super  talented individual like williams can go  given the right circumstances .  br    br   raggedy ann and andy is a strange confection that tries to be weird and experimental and off the wall within the confines of a children  s cartoon . it tries also to be a musical . it tries to be a thousand and one other things as well  is it a freakout  is it a mind  blower  is it a paean to the innocence of childhood imagination   until it finally collapses under the weight of its own limitless ambitions and aspirations . it  s beautifully animated  for the most part  though the bland backgrounds could have used a little more attention  but even that doesn  t count for much when you  re confronted with the hallucinogenic absurdity that constitutes much of the  action  here .  br    br   there are a number of problems with the film  but let  s start with raggedy ann and andy themselves . they  re the stars of the show  yet they have no personalities . actually  we get the message that andy is a wannabe tough guy   i  m no girl  s toy   he sings  and that ann has a unique perspective on things because her owner  a little girl called marcella  carries her upside down  but that  s all we get to find out about these dull  as  mud characters because the overwhelming weirdness of this film kicks in not long after . i use the word  weirdness  advisedly  because some weird films can be hugely entertaining  but this is just flat  out strange . the toys and dolls in the playroom are supposed to be cute and lovable  but they  re actually bizarre and disturbing . the two marionettes who do and say everything in sync are a prime example of this . but even they  re relatively normal compared to the constantly sneezing pirate captain  whose moustache becomes erect and whose groin visibly swells when he first catches sight of a glamorous french doll . yes  this is supposed to be a children  s film  then there  s the music  none of which is memorable  and all of which is sung by actors who can  t sing . and to add insult to injury  there  s a lot of singing in this film . when ann and andy finally make it out of the playroom  the first thing they do is sing a long number in the woods about how scared they are  about how they  ll always have each other and . . . yes  we get the message . this seems to go on forever  but at least it brings some semblance of normality back to the film . not for long  though  because the camel with the wrinkled knees leads us into a bizarre world where everything looks like it  s made from worn and faded denim  and  bad enough that he  s clearly a paranoid schizophrenic  he also starts hallucinating . but this is nothing compared to the scenes that follow . the greedy  a living  breathing . belching  farting  constantly eating pool of taffy  is so trippy  creepy and ultimately disturbing  you  ll hardly believe what you  re seeing  this is as close to a drug  free psychedelic experience as i  ve ever seen on film . then  after a l  o  n  g time spent with the greedy  along comes the psychotic sir leonard looney and his master king kookoo  whose throne resembles a urinal . i can  t believe i  m actually writing a capsule description of a real film here  i just had to rub my eyes and remind myself that i  m not blogging about an overwhelmingly whacked  out nightmare i had . part of the sequence in looney land resembles one of the old winsor mccay  little nemo cartoons  for no good reason other than somebody felt like doing it  probably . all this would be fine if there was some kind of rhyme or reason behind it  but there isn  t . these scenes are just strange  and very  very long . surrealism only works when there  s a strong idea behind it  or takes place against some semblance of reality . but nothing in these scenes points towards any kind of reality . take away this element  and you  re left with pure self indulgence .  br    br   as the final scenes unravel  even the animation begins to look less impressive  the pirate ship  ludicrously detailed  jerks about on the water in a manner that suggests some of the cels went missing during the production  and there  s a non  event of an ending that simply suggests money ran out . even at a meagre   minutes in length  the film feels like a never  ending ordeal  and it  s understandable why it flopped on its original release . animation buffs will probably scratch their heads and wonder just how williams managed to flub this one so spectacularly  but he did  and there  s nothing anyone can do about it .  ,0
have you ever seen a movie made up entirely of long wide shots  no  me  neither . well  i  ve finally seen one in  spring in my hometown   and i must confess  now i know why people don  t do this . the technique is  arty   to be sure  but it  s definitely not ripe for public consumption . the technique is heavily flawed simply because the viewer has no emotional attachment to the characters  and perhaps that might be the director  s whole intentions . i don  t know  i can  t read minds  and i certainly don  t know enough about the director to make a judgement .  br    br   but one thing about this movie that is painfully obvious is its ridiculous anti  american sentiments . as an american  i  m well aware of my country  s participation in the korean war  and i  m very well aware that we weren  t always angels  but i  ll be damn if i  ll take this guy  s version of how things happened . according to this blind fool  americans were not only at the root of the war  we were the cause of the war  and we almost singlehandedly destroyed the country . whatever  mister director . and i suppose you  d still be making this film in communist korea if we hadn  t interfered  right  talk about forgetting your history . this is almost akin to making the nazis the  good guys  while turning the allied forces into the  bad guys .  this movie is so historically naive and so factually inaccurate that it  s almost embarrassing to watch . for a man who comes from a country that owes its very existence to american interference  he sure comes off as high and mighty and judgemental .  ,0
you cannot deny that we have an affinity for speed . that  s why movies like fast and the furious  dhoom  rempit get made to play to the satisfaction of audiences  especially local ones . we live on a tiny island  and i cannot fathom why  for the relative efficiency of the public transportation system  most of us want to get into debt by owning a set of wheels which come with     tax when they reach our shores  and the myriad of taxes and bills to pay when operating one . not only that  the high end sports cars were once quipped by a prominent politician up north that they will never reach fourth gear  lest they reach the sea .  br    br   and these movies are relatively easy to make . hot wheels and hot chicks always go down well together in targeting the required demographic . for once  those plunging necklines exposing uncanny buxom and short skirts accentuating legs two meters long  can  t compete with the attention given to those beautiful curves that exotic cars possess in movies such as these . of course there are amongst us  ahem  those that go for the sexists portrayal of women as mere sexual objects  otherwise explain why motor shows come with truckloads of models  and movies such as these cannot do without a leggy model in a frame   however  they don  t warrant the kind of collective orgasmic sighs whenever the four wheelers come on screen  even when they do exactly nothing and have their gears into park . the guy sitting beside me  i swear he wet his pants every time his dream car  s  appear  and creamed his pants even more when he hears those growling engine moans .  br    br   so there we have it  the fan boys who turned up in droves just to watch which of the latest cool cars get featured in the movie . with the fast and the furious franchise  the japanese models like the evos and the skylines take centerstage  as does the gt . here  the ford gt takes on an incredibly drool  worthy facade modification  that even i  m impressed  alongside the latest models like the ferrari enzos  porshe carerra gts  koenigsegg ccxs  and every car out there that has wings for doors . but seriously  my heart goes out to the cars each time they  re mercilessly wrecked just for entertainment . i mean  this are perfectly fine  high performance models that are at the apex of motoring  but yet because whoever financed the movie had millions to blow  they do so because they can   br    br   there  s no story in redline  just excuses to put together a movie full of beauties  the cars that is  that can rip down the tarmac in probably the most boring fashion possible  and with the usual shots of pedals  always the accelerator  mind you  tapping the brake pedal is tantamount to blasphemy  and earn you no respect   steering wheels  gear shifts  always shifting up and not down   all these while having the actors make pretend that they  re the baddest asses with an engine  snarling and giving each other dirty looks . not a very tall order for an actor  and that  s why we get the most woeful performances ever  with lines that seem to be written by elementary schoolkids .  br    br   the heroine  yes  it made a statement that girls can drive  natasha  a very plasticky looking nadia bjorlin  is one of those million dollar finds  a girl with model looks who don  t mind getting down on fours and immersed in oil  who has racing pedigree within her  and performs with a rock band singing songs with lyrics that are just plain laughable  every line had to do with cars  and when singing about love  just had to string those innuendos like shifting gear shafts  lubricants and going for rides  . introduced against her wishes to illegal racing by a gangsta called infamous  eddie griffin   she gets drawn into family squabbles involving a leo dicaprio lookalike iraq war veteran  and some sleazy lecherous looking rich uncle . everything else  well like i said  just serves as an excuse for the movie to go from race to race .  br    br   and it  s almost always the same  as there  s very limited to what you can do to heighten tension between race cars  especially when you know the race is rigged  for narrative reasons  and can see the race outcome a mile away from the finishing line . while fast and furious had quite charismatic actors  and i will put my head on the chopping block by naming paul walker  sun kang  and of course  the star it created  vin diesel  redline had none  just pretty faces with lots of air unfortunately . it looks like a tv movie in its treatment from the get go  with a very insipid opening sequence where it  s one man  one car  and a    minutes race against time to get to vegas .  br    br   if not for the cars  then this movie seriously is a piece of junk  with bad acting  bad lines and bad action . strictly for the car fans  or those who like their movies with countless of bevy beauties who pimp their bodies without any speaking lines .  ,0
though not a fan of sam rockwell  i was surprised when i saw his name in the credits in the opening of  joshua .  heck  i wasn  t even aware he was in  joshua  until i started the movie . so it goes without saying  i was watching the movie on the basis of the movie  not the leads . a sort of  rosemary  s baby    the omen  or any other demonic kid movie  joshua  was billed . unfortunately  it fell flat . slow  incredibly slow  and flat . yet  i continued on to see how this would all resolve  hoping beyond belief  the ending climax would shed some light on the subject . okay  i admit  it did  a wee bit  but what a stale closing . and what a low  low budget movie  or at least that  s how they designed it . a person falls  you don  t see the drop  you see someone lying down in what appears to be blood . a person gets hit by a cab  you don  t see it  you see someone complaining  holding a bike up . i  m not sure if this is called  style  or laziness or simply  lack of funds for special effects . we have a  rich  family with a crazy mom  a workaholic father attempting to balance everything  a kid  joshua  who may  may not be the antichrist and a new born baby girl who cries a lot . she cries as much as we see how many days she  s alive  and what was that about  are there rats above or is it joshua  is his mother nuts  is joshua crazy  is he merely jealous of the newcomer to the family  is he going to grow up to be michael myers  or does he drive his family to the brink  i don  t think so . they were nuts prior  and no  so  called  acting could make me believe otherwise . unfortunately  barely any questions were answered  barely any open doors shut . i  m sure that might have been the idea  but for pete  s sake  give me something . anything . there are plenty better kid  gone  wild movies to explore . joshua  s more like the mini  me of the antichrist .  ,0
i saw this movie the first seconds the voice of t . r . took me on to the journey  well i disliked the big glued thumbs in the beginning  but the absurd humor it and the gordious looks of both sissy actors  i do not know who played the young her  but she was great and so was uma      br    br   the two other people who where in the cinema went out after about half an hour  i was with a friend  and it is always a test to watch a movie i like good with one of my friends  and  we both enjoyed it too the maximum  hilarious laughs  sadness about the  realistic police  normalos  . both of us fans of t . robbins books . . . i found it well done  thought  that robbins would also approve  though i do not have an idea if he likes the film or not . . .  br    br   i would love to see the cut out stuff  i heard that gus v . sand had to take out lots of scenes because of the first  time viewers  or the producers     well still it is an artistic movie . much too short though . . . it is one of my all time favorites  and i am aware of it that the majority of people can  t stand that kind of movie and assume that people who enjoy that films are whatever they think . . . . . . . what a pity . hopefully there will come the day that there will be a dvd with the full material  hoping to see more of crispian  keanu  expecting to see her baby and all  br    br   if you have the chance to see it  think twice  and enjoy it if you made the choice to watch . . . m  ,1
in iran  the islamic revolution has shaped all parts of life  including everyday things . but people still go on living their lives  generally just doing the things you  d expect  like go to soccer matches to cheer on the national team as it  s in the running to qualify for the world cup . except women aren  t allowed to go to the soccer stadium to watch the game .  br    br   a frequently funny little film follows the small group of women that were caught sneaking into the soccer stadium and the little group of bored soldiers assigned to guard them in a holding pen just outside the stadium . the absurdity of the situation  the simple wish of these women to cheer on the team  nothing subversive there   and little human touches about the lives of everyone adds up to quite a fine comment on humanity versus the ideology .  br    br   amateurish acting  good script and dialogue  a really enjoyable film . bend it like beckham  sort of  a warm heart and a joy in the daily interests and pleasures of people .  ,1
the movie is okay  it has it  s moments  the music scenes are the best of all  the soundtrack is a true classic . it  s a perfect album  it starts out with let  s go crazy  appropriate for the beginning as it  s a great party song and very up  tempo   take me with u  a fun pop song . . .   the beautiful ones  a cheerful ballad  probably the closest thing to rb on this whole album   computer blue  a somewhat angry anthem towards appolonia   darling nikki  one of the funniest songs ever  it very vaguely makes fun of appolonia   when doves cry  the climax to this masterpiece   i would die  u  baby i  m a star  and  of course  purple rain  a true classic  a very appropriate ending for this classic album  the movie and the album are both very good . i highly recommend them   ,1
this little film had long been on my  keeper  list . do people realize how stressed out  menopausal  emotionally abused women  as well as the mentally retarded  were really treated by the medical profession at the turn of the century     all of the pious uptight christian attitudes of that time were deadly to exploring true emotional feelings that would allow us to embrace suffering souls  let alone explore what it means to embrace our humanity . can you really imagine  by today  s standards  that walt whitman  s books were banned because he acknowledged women as having feelings and emotional responses as great as a mans  think about that  the sensitivity of this movie still gets me and i give credit to the director for capturing this through his eyes .  ,1
this is one amazing movie      you have to realize that chinese folklore is complicated and philosophical . there are always stories behind stories . i myself did not understand everything but knowing chinese folklore  i studied them in school  it is very complicated . you just have to take what it gives you . . . . . enjoy the movie and enjoy the ride . . . . hooray      ,1
the idea of making a miniseries about the berlin airlift seemed to me as one of the more interesting german  post  war movies . it is a theme that has not been explored much as yet . however  the makers of this series stuffed it with clichs . it starts already with the dvd cover of the movie  which is a direct copy of the cover of  pearl harbor  .  br    br   luise kielberg  bettina zimmermann  gets to hear that her husband  who is a doctor   ulrich noethen  has died in russia and after the war she  s struggling to survive . she finds a job at the american base  gets to work for the coolest and highest ranking officer  heino ferch  in town  falls in love with  m  gets pregnant  and all of a sudden her husband turns up again . come on    we  ve seen this once too often . heino ferch and ulrich noethen play their role quite well bettina zimmermann however never really seems to convince . for some reason it always seems she  s somewhat too late in giving the right emotional reaction to the scenes . it just didn  t work for me .  br    br   the action scenes with the planes and the air lift  we  re sometimes exciting  more often not . nasty things always seemed to happen to the same pilot .  br    br   unless you  re a big fan of wwii movies  i suggest you spend your money on something else chocolate ice  cream brings a lot more satisfaction   br    br    out     ,0
this is surely one of the worst films ever made . each scene is painful . you will groan at the flimsy attempts at humor  the awkward camera work  the sexism and racism  the ridiculous story line  the wooden acting . poor joan bennett she is the only one in the movie who is not an embarrassment . in all  dreadful .  ,0
i read somewhere that when kay francis refused to take a cut in pay  warner bros . retaliated by casting her in inferior projects for the remainder of her contract .  br    br   she decided to take the money . but her career suffered accordingly .  br    br   that might explain what she was doing in  comet over broadway .   though it doesn  t explain why donald crisp and ian hunter are in it  too .   ludicrous  is the word that others have used for the plot of this film  and that  s right on target . the murder trial . her seedy vaudeville career . her success in london . her final scene with her daughter . no part logically leads to the next part .  br    br   also  the sets and costumes looked like b  movie stuff . and her hair  turner is showing lots and lots of her movies this month . watch any other one and you  ll be doing yourself a favor .  ,0
having heard quite positive reviews and having seen the trailer i had to see this movie . with william h . macy  luis guzman  michael jeter and sam rockwell present it had to be good . and it delivered . overall  the movie is not crack  you  up funny  but there is one scene that really stands out and is  in a my eyes  a classic . spoiler at the end  where they break through the wall to get to the safe and we see rockwell and washington stare at jeter is just fantastic . this is just as good as the scene in the big lebowski where the dude is using a chair to barricade his door  but forgets the door turns outward  end spoiler just go see this movie  you won  t be disappointed .  ,1
i watched this movie when joe bob briggs hosted monstervision on tnt . even he couldn  t make this movie enjoyable . the only reason i watched it until the end is because i teach video production and i wanted to make sure my students never made anything this bad . . . but it took all my intestinal fortitude to sit through it though . it  s like watching your great grandmother flirting with a   year old boy . . . excruciatingly painful .  br    br   if you took the actual film  dipped it in paint thinner  then watched it  it would be more entertaining . seriously .  br    br   if you see this movie in the bargin bin at s  mart  back away from it as if it were a rattlesnake .  ,0
the movie had a lot of potential  unfortunately  it came apart because of a weak  implausible story line  miscasting  and general lack of content  substance . one of the very obvious flaws was that sean connery  who played an arab man  didn  t know how to pronounce his own arab name  this may seem a small flaw but it points to the seeming lack of effort in paying attention to details . the quality of acting was uniformly well below average .  br    br   movie  s solitary saving grace was the twist in the plot at the very end and a french song  i don  t recall the title  . overall  it was a pretty bad movie where sean connery was visibly miscast .  ,0
i would give this movie  rather than  if it would be at least in time . . . when i  ve seen it in first time it was just what you could wait from the work that is based not on the artistic abilities of the directors but on the idealistic or i would rather say idiotic habits of our  kazakhstan  government . . . it  s a shame  because  qazaqfil  m  was been shooting nice movies when it was not honoured by the name of shaken aimanov  but it was actually ran by him . the movies like  konec atamana    kyz zhibek  or even  aldar kose  . but after mr aimanov  s death the production of quality movies went down almost dramatically in   years time there were very few films produced . however  in late     s   assa  was shot  it was a film about first organised crime groups in the big country  one year later mr . rashid nugmanov shot another film with the co  staring of the same actor  singer v . tsoy  at that time he was already a soviet  russian rock legend   the movie called  igla   the needle or something  it was completely new  somebody called that period as resurrection or a new kazakh movie wave . unfortunately nowadays we do not have a quality movies  our directors shooting movies on the french and japanese financial support  and thus movies are not for the public but for the authors professional critics  some of them take a price on international author movie festivals but there a very few of them become a business asset products . . . and again back to our  nomads  . such movies usually unpopular because of vast aspects . the same effects was with nikita mikhalkov  s  sibirski cyrilnik  about russian tsars  that was also shot on parities with foreign partners  i think they were french or maybe british . nobdy liked it  even in russian public it become as a main topic of a comedians and comedy shows like  kvn  . imho  ,0
i watched dvd  only . the program proper may have   minutes of good information otherwise it  s snotty putdowns of religious people . it  s as if director brian flemming only recently discovered both atheism and sarcasm  and feels with these tools he can easily bludgeon his opposition .  br    br   also  flemming wanders extensively into his own personal issues  and they take over the movie . it never gets back on topic .  br    br   religious people are prone to discount skeptics when their objections to religion are obviously rooted in abusive upbringings . arguments from such victimized people seem irrational  and therefore unconvincing .  br    br   anti  religious people will want more data . we don  t need to be told that religious people are nutty  any more than american jews need to be told how annoying christmas music gets by mid  december .  br    br   in the best scene  the superintendent of fleming  s childhood christian school rather insightfully confronts the director on his motivations . that seems like the most honest part of the movie  and it was too short .  br    br   if fleming were a bit more self  aware  he might have a good story in him about his own  past  current  relationship to christianity  and the abusive institutions that indoctrinated him in his youth .  br    br   and perhaps he could lend his  christ never walked the earth  material to a more serious documentarian . i  m not studying the writings of saul  paul to find out how air  tight this all is  but a quick browse of wikipedia suggests most of these arguments are discredited .  br    br   the bonus interviews are pretty good  tho they don  t bolster fleming  s thesis much . sam harris is a good spokesperson for the anti  religious pov  and he doesn  t go light on those other  non  christian religions . harris also has some good  and easily google  d  interviews on salon . com  amazon . com  and samharris . org .  ,0
this was director von stroheim  s third effort  it is quite crude and shows none of the exceptional flair for the camera and editing mastery he would display a few years later with his masterworks  greed and the wedding march . essentially we have a trio of grifters  masquerading as a russian count and two russian princesses who have rented a villa in monte carlo . their aim is to use counterfeit money at the gambling tables and win a fortune . part of that plan is for the count  von stroheim  to insinuate himself between a visiting american ambassador and his  foolish  wife  wooing her and hoping to gain some money by playing on her weaknesses . he makes the mistake of also taking the life savings of the maid  whom he has promised to marry . when she sees them together  she sets fire to the room   von stroheim and his prey are on the room  s balcony  . here von stroheim first establishes his persona as  the man you love to hate .  he is thoroughly bad and his character flaws eventually bring him to a very bad and deserved end . the film is crude in its cinematography and editing and not worth seeing unless you are fascinated by the director . there is a cute bit  when he first attempts to meet the ambassador  s wife  she is reading a book  we see the title  foolish wives by erich von stroheim . this was originally envisioned as a    minute film  cut down to    minutes by the studio and finally released at   minutes . the restoration on kino video restores surviving footage  damaged in some way in most scenes  from the alternate earlier version to give us a    minute print .  ,0
my daughter  her friends and i have watched this movie literally dozens of times . i bought it twice and some little girlfriends absconded with it . subsequently  i rented it so very many times . it just never gets old    blockbuster doesn  t even have it in their listings anymore and i have tried to buy  find  rent it for over  years . without a doubt  this was and is my most favourite movie of my daughter  s childhood . . . it has it all  we laughed  we cried  we discussed real life and how hard some children have it in the world . there was nothing pretend about this movie . we related to every second and every line bill  thanks a million for restoring our faith in human nature . sincerely  shelleen and kailin vandermey . craven  saskatchewan . canada  eh        br    br   august    update  br    br   who are we to judge if a rich woman falls in love with a poor man or a man who has love chooses to raise a child who is not his own . it may not be my or your life . it is not only believable  it happens every day . thank god  keeps my faith in human nature alive    celebrate      ,1
as a member of the cast  i was a member of the band at all the basketball games  i would like to let the world know after being in the movie  that we were not allowed to see it since it was banned in oregon . this was due to the producers and the director breaking the contract with the university of oregon where it was shot . seems that the u of o sign was shown . while we were shooting  we were allowed to eat several meals with the cast and production staff . mr nicholson was quite memorable for being one of the most ill  mannered men i have ever met . quite a time for a young   year old . but certainly not what campus life was really like in the late    s and early    s despite what hollywood may think . trombone player from oregon  ,0
oh man is this movie bad . it flows horribly . the story is about a race car driver who is in love with himself  and then has to promote a chicken fast food chain and while doing this  doesn  t love himself . he tries getting out of the contract and horrible  painfully unfunny gags ensue . jim nabors seems as if he  s sleepwalking  not acting . you  ll miss such burt sidekicks as dom deluise and jerry reed while watching this stinker . loni anderson  s hair is downright scary  proving that tons of hairspray didn  t go out in the sixties . or maybe that was a wig . speaking of  burt  s wig wasn  t bad in this film . his worst  wig day  was in  smokey and the bandit   . anyhow  this movie is the worst reynolds car movie  ever  ever  right up there with  cannonball run   . the original  smokey  and  cannonball   and  hooper  which  thankfully  had no sequel  are great  funny films . this one isn  t . even ned beatty  who is a great actor  stinks . you  ll long for a jackie gleason type villain who is fun to hate . and mind you  this isn  t one of those fun movies to bag on . it  s lousy  pure and simple . even the outtakes at the end were tiresome and boring  and worst of all  unfunny . and least i forget   stroker ace  was one of the first heavy nails to seal burt  s coffin before his somewhat  revival years later in  boogie nights   another film that  like  deliverance  years earlier  shows that the man can act quite good when he has a decent platform to do so .  ,0
new york  i love you  or rather should  be  titled manhattan  i love looking at your people in sometimes love  is a precise example of the difference between telling a story and telling a situation . case in point  look at two of the segments in the film  one where ethan hawke lights a cigarette for a woman on a street and proceeds to chat her up with obnoxious sexy  talk  and another with orlando bloom trying to score a movie with an incredulous demand from his director to read two dostoyevsky books . while the latter isn  t a great story by any stretch  it  s at least something that has a beginning  middle and end  as the composer tries to score  gets dostoyevky dumped in his lap  and in the end gets some help  and maybe something more  from a girl he  s been talking to as a liaison between him and the director . the ethan hawke scene  however  is like nothing  and feels like it  like a fluke added in or directed by a filmmaker phoning it in  or  for that matter  hawke with a combo of before sunrise and reality bites  .  br    br   what  s irksome about the film overall is seeing the few stories that do work really well go up against the one or two possible  stories  and then the rest of the situations that unfold that are made to connect or overlap with one another  i . e . bits involving bradley cooper  drea dematteo  hayden christensen  andy garcia  james caan  natalie portman  etc  . it  s not even so much that the film  set practically always in manhattan and not the new york of queens or staten island or the bronx  not even  say  harlem or washington heights   lacks a good deal of diversity  since there is some . it  s the lack of imagination that one found in spades  for better or worse  in paris j  taime . it  s mostly got little to do with new york  except for passing references  and at its worst  the julie christie  shia labeouf segment  it  s incomprehensible on a level that is appalling .  br    br   so  basically  wait for tv  and do your best to dip in and out of the film  in  that is  for three scenes the aforementioned bloom  christina ricci segment which is charming the brett ratner directed segment  yes  x  men  brett ratner  with a very funny story of a teen taking a girl in a wheelchair to the prom only to come upon a great big twist and eli wallach and cloris leachman as an adorable quite old couple walking along in brooklyn on their   th wedding anniversary . everything else can be missed  even natalie portman  s directorial debut  and the return of a hughes brother  only one  allan  to the screen . a mixed bag is putting it lightly it  s like having to search through a bag of mixed nuts full of crappy peanuts to find the few almonds left .  ,0
i got in to this excellent program in about season  and since then i have seen all the episodes got all the episodes on dvd and keeps getting better and better with the seasons of  and   . it now may not have richard dean anderson now but the addition of ben browder and claudie black it has still given the show more strength and original still even after   seasons . sadly now the sci  fi channel got rid of this amazing show with no hope relay for a   season there are making two direct to dvd movie and hopefully more . atlantis is still going strong on its  th seasons . and there is a third spin off in the works the stargate franchise is nowhere near dead . this tv show is a must see for all sci  fi fans and people of genres because this has such a wide range of things to appeal to all ages and all types of people watch it            ,1
if you like adult comedy cartoons  like south park  then this is nearly a similar format about the small adventures of three teenage girls at bromwell high . keisha  natella and latrina have given exploding sweets and behaved like bitches  i think keisha is a good leader . there are also small stories going on with the teachers of the school . there  s the idiotic principal  mr . bip  the nervous maths teacher and many others . the cast is also fantastic  lenny henry  s gina yashere  eastenders chrissie watts  tracy  ann oberman  smack the pony  s doon mackichan  dead ringers  mark perry and blunder  s nina conti . i didn  t know this came from canada  but it is very good . very good   ,1
i love bed knobs and broomsticks so much that it makes me cry a thousand tears of joy every time i have the magnificent pleasure of seeing it . i would also like to reiterate the simple fact that i love it so much . too much some have said . i have   copies on video and i love them all equally . i also love anyone else who loves it . i love you . my favourite scene is the dance scene at portobello road . i have learned the dance moves and practice it everyday . i have some audio recordings of myself singing the song . if anyone can play the drums or guitar i am thinking of forming a bed knobs and broomsticks band . i hope to call it  the knobs  . love me  liz   ,1
bad . bad . bad . bad . bad . what else can i say . kate jackson must have been desperate to direct . may be she should go back to acting . . . on second thought she was a bad actress to . who would put money in to producing something this bad . i like anti  christ movies and usually have a good laugh and the odd scare but this one is just bad bad bad . the acting by the stars was worse than what you find on a soap opera . the special effects  if you can call them that  where laughable . i would not be surprised if you played the scenes in slow motion you would see the tubes the blood shoots out of . we had to turn the disc off after only   minutes . this so called movies original prints should be destroyed  all disc  and tapes destroyed and all the people associated with the making of the movie have to pay back money to the people that rented the movie . then those people should never be allowed to act  direct or film any thing but their own home movies .  ,0
i saw the big bad swim at the     temecula film festival  and was totally caught off guard by how much i was drawn into it .  br    br   the film centers around the lives of a group of people taking an adult swim class for various reasons . a humorous idea in its own right  the class serves as a catalyst for greater changes in the students  lives .  br    br   what surprised me about the film was how real it felt . rarely in ensemble pieces are characters treated so well . i enjoyed the scenes in the class immensely  and the drama that took place outside was very poignant . nothing seemed out of place or out of character  and ultimately it left a very strong feeling  much like attending school or summer camp  where you find fast friends  form strong bonds  and make discoveries about yourself  yet have to depart all too soon .  br    br   my only complaint was that the character of paula had a very strong and unusual introduction  which made you want to know a little more about her than was ultimately revealed . i suppose you don  t get to meet everyone in class  though . . .  br    br   aside from this  i found the film very well  rounded and quite enjoyable . see it if you get the opportunity .  ,1
this is simply a classic film where the human voices coming from the animals are really what they  re thoughts are . i don  t know whether my video copy has a scene missing but it never shows how the dogs got out of the pit . it also shows an animals survival instinct and tracking abilities . put humans in the same position ant the helicopters would be out . for once an original film is improved by a remake as the voice  over for the first has been removed . only the use of animals can work in a film of this kind because using people would have had to spice out the story by turning it into murder  proving that  after all  animals are more interesting than people  ,1
well  i can honestly say that this is the first time that i experienced a film that had literally no meat or potatoes in it . the entire film felt like it was just the salad with no main course . the story line was fallible and laughable  the characters were one  dimensional  the realism was out the window  and the animation was done by four  year olds . does that cover it  i have never been more embarrassed for a concept in my entire life . i have never read the comics or seen the other programs with this character  but from the looks of the other reviews i am not off base with my observation .  br    br   to begin  the story moved too quickly . for someone new to this character and situations  i needed more built into creating the reasons instead of finding the solution . i have seen other anime  if you could call this one an anime  that do great things with their characters because they take the time to develop them . there was nothing set aside for lady death . in a few short scenes  we see her train with cremator and instantly become this aggressive she  beast of hell . this was hard for me to swallow  considering moments before she was introduced as this weak and feeble woman controlled by her father . suddenly  she is immersed with hatred and can do battle with an existence that has been around for millions of years . this was absurd . the presentation of lady death was poor  to say the least . i felt as if she was nothing more than an animated character instead of a desperate woman with revenge on the mind . for me  it just didn  t work . she was nothing more than eye  candy for prepubescent boys wanting to ogle the mass quantities of skin that she suddenly grew on her chest when training with cremator . oh  i felt sick just watching her . the same goes for the character of cremator . who was this random person  the explanation they gave wasn  t enough  and instead i was left with more incoherent babbling than actual development . it is a very sad day in hell when we forgo characters to show more violence and action  especially in an animated feature .  br    br   next  there was lucifer himself . let me just say that i think i could do battle with the king of hell and survive . he was weak  his voice was laughable  and he just didn  t represent the image that i had in my mind . it was as if disney was in control and wanted to make him semi  pc . he lacked the darkness and corrupt nature that lucifer embodies . he was not the ruler of hell  but instead just a lackey that had a bigger place to live . speaking of living or dying  how can you die again in hell  that was a concept that definitely needed more explanation . most of the characters were worrying about dying  when they didn  t even consider the option that they were already dead . that is how they got to hell . i think it was this level of thinking that ruined the film for me . i didn  t quite capture the notion that your soul was still in a solid body in hell  but that could just be me  or maybe it was because there was no development in this story . there was nothing built  just preparing .  br    br   the battle sequences were hysterically bad . the animation in this cartoon felt like it was made in the early   s . there was nothing impressive about the way that this film was drawn . why are we  america  so behind on animation  it is huge in asia  and it is creeping in hardcore here because we keep making films like lady death that do not challenge or use any part of imagination . we are cheap  and this film shows it .  br    br   overall  this film was bad . the animation coupled with the horrendous voice work was cheap . i had head somewhere that this film as in production for a long time  which is hard to understand because i think i could have made this film on my credit card . the production was horrendous as well as the story . nothing was developed  leaving huge gaping plot holes that nearly everyone fell into . the strength of the characters was missing  and nothing was explained . i wasted my time with this one and would like to warn others so that when death does come  you don  t find yourself in my state and regretting the fact that you wasted   minutes on this piece of garbage .  br    br   blah   br    br   grade  out of   ,0
this movie was way over  hyped . a lot of the viewers  who thought this was  amazing  must have been into the old school movies  cause the whole movie is set in the past . at first i thought the movie was just showing something from the past  so i was expecting that faded dreamy like lighting on the characters to pass  but it just going . basically this was a movie trying to mix the future with the past  and the  don  t mix very well in this movie  even with special effects . you could actually see the blue screen the actors were working with . there are too many movies out there that do exactly what this movie did  so there is no reason for critics to hype this movie up saying  it  s the greatest movie ever done  . it  s just crap on a stick . it also didn  t help that the story line was sooo crappy . i don  t understand why hollywood agreed to have this movie produced  and i also don  t understand how actors  actresses in this movie are willing to be in a movie like this . it  s almost as though everybody read the script and forgot to read the fine print . . .  it will all be done on a computer  . this was a movie that should have been on a movie network  because nothing about this movie was revolutionary . i  m very upset with myself for paying money to see this . whatever you do  don  t waste your time and money on this movie today or tomorrow .  ,0

yeah cheap shot i know  but this movie is a great example of how a collection of signifiers of  deepness   political turmoil  love  lust  can be combined haphazardly to great critical acclaim  see also  american beauty   . kaufman  s movie plods along with gratuitous sex scenes interspersed with often painful dialog sequences  in one scene i counted three different  generic european  accents affected by the actors  and displays of state might run amok  yet fails to tie them together into the coherent meditation kundera offered . and in its over  long three hours it manages almost completely to gloss over franz  the missing fourth piece in the love triangle that lies at the heart of the plot  and in this manner sacrifices the novel  s central mechanism of displaying the spectrum of emotions and of power relations that obtain in love affairs . it also fails to even include token screen time for tomas  son  used in the novel to exemplify some of the political points kundera was making in the novel . combined with the overweening soundtrack  these flaws make this movie  s three hours unbearably weighty in tone yet light in content .  ,0
susan swift is an appealing youngster  a flower child transplanted to the      s  like a young susan dey   but she doesn  t quite have the vocal range for a demanding dramatic lead and she tends to whine still  she  s rather sweet and has bright eyes and a pretty smile . in  the coming   as it was called when briefly released to theaters   swift may be the reincarnation of a salem witch . the flick is very low  budget and borrows from so many other pictures that i gave up on it with about   minutes to go . it starts out strong and has some camp appeal . obviously  there are more serious films that deal with the salem witch trials that deserve to be seen over this one however  as junk movies go  it isn  t too terrible . the boston locales are a definite plus  and the supporting cast is amusingly hammy .     from   ,0
i saw this as a child in the late eighties and i must say  galaxy express is one of those films that sticks in your imagination for a long time . if you  ve never understood the appeal of anime  discovering this film may be your golden ticket to otaku  town .  br    br   the story is as delicate and poetic as ridley scott  s blade runner . the cell animation  while somewhat traditional  possesses a vivid style that explosively portrays leiji matsumoto  s great talent for character design and visual storytelling .  br    br   this is one of those unique children  s films like star wars  the dark crystal and the wizard of oz that completely transcends  family entertainment  status and stands as a classic of cinema on its own terms .  br    br   i highly recommend this film .  ,1
a horror movie is being shot and things aren  t going well . it  s about a masked killer . the director tells off the killer in front of the cast and crew . he goes crazy and kills two people . he  s killed himself and the film is never finished . twelve years later a bunch of film students decide to try and finish it   but there  s a curse . people who try and finish it are killed themselves . the students ignore that . guess what happens next   br    br   the plot is old hat but this isn  t bad . . . for what it is  a low budget slasher film  . it  s well  made with a young and fairly talented young cast . no one is great but no one is terrible either . it also avoids the obligatory  and needless  female nude scenes . it moves quickly  the gore is nice and bloody and the script doesn  t insult your intelligence . also molly ringwald is in this having the time of her life playing a bitchy faded actress .  br    br   no great shakes but not bad at all . i give it a  .  ,1

cage       was another one of those low budget  buddy  action flicks that were produced during the    s thanks in large part due to the films such as   hrs . and lethal weapon . this one stars reb brown and lou ferrigno as to former vietnam vets who happen to run a local dive bar . reb takes care of lou because he saved his life in  nam . but lou was shot in the head and is now pretty soft . although he  s huge  lou has the brain of a child . one day some ruffians throw their wait around in the bar and lou and rebb beat the tar out of them . but payback  s a mother . they crash the bar leaving lou and reb with nothing . that is until these two thugs come into the picture  one of them  s a real nice guy  who have a plan in mind .  br    br   the film  s a waste of time . maybe if they went all they way and made a hard core action flick instead of trying to tone down the gruesomeness of the situation perhaps it could have worked . alas  it doesn  t and the audience is left holding the bag . oh well . it  s too bad because you have all the elements for a great b  movie . better luck next time  i guess .  br    br   not recommended .  br    br   xxx  ,0

music that grinds on the nerves like fingernails on a blackboard  acting that is so zombielike it was a shame to waste the cast by not making a second movie casting everyone in it as true zombies    with the cast of sabrina the teenaged witch as the heroes . . . a movie so downright awful that if  stoners  were still around it might be considered a cult movie    but  oh so amateurish  the scripts might as well have been carried around by the actors  their lines read as they slowly shuffled through the movie    banal  illogical sets modeled after la subdivisions  props straight from toysrus  was a movie ever made that is so completely and totally inept    logic flies to the wind in this plodding  senseless  pointless and with a  monster  so stupid and uncoordinated that it couldn  t catch a turtle in an icebox    lowcut  leggy    and amazon  it kept my attention all the way through the way a terrible  ongoing chain accident in the fog involving multiple vehicles keeps one watching to the very end . . . as  after a ridiculous ray  gun fight in a prison on another planet  a pneumaticaly  disadvantaged sexy and mentally unbalanced bounty hunter chases a retarded extra  terrestrial fugitive    to earth  don  t let anybody ps on your popcorn  you might actually enjoy watching this one . it  s that bad   ,0
if this guy can make a movie  then i sure as hell can make one too .  br    br   in fact  if you hire me to make a movie for you  i promise to do the following  br    br     i will add more naked women . this movie had none . i think cheesy b  class horror movies are only rented because of their traditional exploitation of the female body . i wouldn  t want to let my viewers down .  br    br     i will refrain from making too many scenes where the hero wakes up to find out it  s only a dream . i think horrorvision had about  of these scenes . and  considering the movie was only like an hour long  the dream  to  movie  length ratio was quite high . and  if i do decide to do a dream sequence  i will make sure that the person wakes up without clothes on . i mean  who sleeps in leather pants    br    br     i will not rip off any movies like star wars or the matrix because i will know that my budget is small and i will not want to mask my contempt for big  budget hollywood movies by adding satirical references about them in mine .  br    br     and finally  i will not mix modern technology with the undead . i mean  a palm pilot can only be so scary . . . at least they turned it into an evil rolly  polly monster before the screen blew up or something .  br    br   so  if you are looking for the above qualities in your next horror production  count on me wanna  b  movie director extraordinaire .  ,0
actually  this is a lie  shrek   d was actually the first  d animated movie . i bought it on dvd about  years ago . didn  t bug  s life also do that  i think it was at disneyworld in that tree  so i  m saying before they go and use that as there logo . also  shrek  d was a motion simulator at universal studios . they should still consider it as a movie  because it appeared in a  theater  and you could buy it for dvd . the movie was cute  at least the little flyes were . i liked iq . i agree with animaster  they did a god job out of making a movie out of something that is just a out  and  back adventure . i recommend it to families and kids .  ,0
my life is about saving animals . i do volunteer work with a cat rescue organization . i am a vegetarian because i couldn  t kill an animal even to sustain my life . i can  t even kill a spider  i put it outdoors . the scene where the children throw rocks at the bird until it dies  with sooner participating in an attempt to be accepted by the other children  made me sick and has haunted me ever since . it simply convinces me that human beings are pathetic in their need for acceptance . the ending  the foster parents adopt sooner  does not redeem the depiction of animal cruelty . why would anyone want their child to see this film   ,0
the first power       was a terrible film that came out during the late    s  early    s era of cheaply made horror films . i found this movie very boring but extremely hilarious in some parts . this movie lacks so much sense and credibility that it ain  t even funny . the swift justice system in this film makes texas look weak by comparison . lou diamond phillips is in way over his head with this role  he plays a hard  boiled cop  and tracey griffith  melanie  s more attractive sister  plays a psychic . don  t waste your time with this one because it  s bad . what a minute  i take it back . this movie makes a great party film . check out the switchblade crucifix packing nun  she has the nicest legs i  ve ever seen on a nun that wasn  t in a jesus franco nunsploitation flick . yeow   br    br   this marked an end of an era for l . d . p . his star was tarnished and he couldn  t draw flies to a dung heap . it was d . t . v . for him until his  ressurection  a few years later .  br    br   not recommended unless you  re desperate .  ,0

the only notable thing about this film is that it was steve mcqueen  s first big starring role .  br    br   mcqueen  s talent is undeveloped and raw but refreshingly honest in this campy little sci  fi horror piece . steve shows himself as the anti  establishment  hot rod car loving actor who would become a polished icon of the film industry just five years hence .  br    br   later on  mcqueen would say he hated this film and that  he was the blob  . but everyone has to start somewhere and the blob is cute  fresh and innocent . would that we all had stayed that way .  br    br   the plot is fast paced and although predictable  still an entertaining hour or so . and it  s really fun to see steve mcqueen before he became the king of kool  and anita corsaut before she became andy taylor  s girlfriend  . a close friend sent me the dvd a while back and it  s a treasured addition to my steve mcqueen film collection .  ,1
elia kazan  one of the best theater directors this country ever had  showed he was equally at home with movies . with  panic in the streets   mr . kazan gives us an early version of what would come later  with perhaps his master piece   on the waterfront   although both movies share only the water setting  for they are different visions about different subjects .  br    br   mr . kazan shot on location in new orleans . the adaptation by daniel fuchs of the edna and edward anhalt stories that are the basis of the film  is remarkable in that it takes us to places that no tourist dared to see when visiting  the big easy  . one of the big assets of this film is the magnificent black and white cinematography by joseph macdonald that shows new orleans at its best . also the music by alfred newman and the song by billie holiday gives the proceedings a nice touch .  br    br   this film  could have been shot in new york  or another northern big city because it presents us with characters that speak more like  broklynese  than maybe a southern accent one might hear in that part of the country .  br    br   one thing comes clear in the movie  jack palance  making his screen debut  smolders the screen every time one sees him . he was so intense  at the same time  this tough guy shows a tender side of him when he goes to see his sick partner  who unknown to him  is stricken with a fatal disease . blackie  comforts this man caressing his sweaty face and running his hands through the dying man  s greasy hair with abandon . notable also  was the fact that mr . palance and mr . mostel appear to have been doing their own stunts  something so refreshing because both actors make it seem real .  br    br   the film also presents a normal side with the introduction of the reed family at the beginning of the film . we see a family man painting furniture with his young son . later he and the wife discuss how it appears they can  t make ends meet with his salary  something that many families have to deal with on a daily basis . richard widmark  playing a normal person is not as effective as when this actor plays more cunning and intense people . barbara bel geddes  as the wife  sounds as though she  s a suburban woman from connecticut .  br    br   the film is enjoyable thanks to mr . kazan  s direction and the excellent cast working in the movie .  ,1
 . . . then they will have a proper place to file this crap . sorry  not a  mystery  as claimed  it is religious mumbo  jumbo . i kept waiting for the  unimaginable evil  that was promised me  but the  evil  in this flick would only be unimaginable by a five year old with learning disabilities .  br    br   i can  t believe that they actually managed to find some bigger name actors willing to be involved in this embarrassment . unfortunately it has forevermore changed my opinion of them  and i will likely avoid anything they do in the future . i  m also a little cheesed off that i now have a writer  s name and director  s name to memorize as i  ll be avoiding anything they do like the plague from now on too .  br    br   it  s really unfortunate that all the religious fanatics posting on here and saying that this movie is   out of    etc . will get their reviews posted first . this could lead to more people getting tricked  as i was  into believing this movie was something other than religious preaching .  br    br   well  it  s off to the video store to get my money back for false advertising . too bad they can  t give me back the    minutes i wasted watching this thinking that it was actually a hollywood horror  supernatural film .  ,0
i was one of those  few americans  that grew up with all of gerry andersen  s marvelous creations . thunderbirds was a great series for the time and would have made a great action  adventure movie if only the writers could have figured out where to target it .  br    br   i expected it to be a romp  but i did not expect it to aim at such a low age group . like lost in space  this could have been both visually stunning and exciting . it should have focused on more action  adventure and the goal of the original series . . . saving people in trouble .  br    br   instead  it focused on alan saving the day instead of his brothers  who were cast too young anyway vs . the original  . the breakout part was lady penelope and parker . i didn  t care too much for the characters in the original  but i was grateful for them in the movie . they stole the show   br    br   i always enjoyed thunderbirds more for the high  tech than the stories  and even that did not get enough screen time as far as i was concerned . i would have enjoyed seeing more of the cool gadgets .  br    br   but then  i  m just a big kid . . .    ,0
there are some good things about the movie . the music and cinematography is great . alex wilson is hot and gives a great performance . ryan bauer is also hot . the production was very lucky to have casted them because they really give production value to the movie . jonny vincent  sean  and a lot of the boys in the movie that don  t speak are cute too . why isn  t the actress who plays amy listed in the credits  brandon alexander gives a great comedic performance as clitarissa pink .  br    br   the worse thing about the movie is probably the star  james townsend . he can  t act . he  s also very scrawny  not nice to look at at all . his arms are like spaghetti . it  s disgusting . they have no muscle tone at all . it  s no wonder he has to make his own movie and cast himself in it . no one else would cast him in anything .  br    br   james townsend is not believable as someone who would even have a girlfriend because he acts so gay . they should have casted someone else as the lead if they wanted what  s best for the movie . then again  maybe he just wants to use this movie as a vehicle to launch a career in soft  core porn  definitely not real acting because he would have taken some acting lessons . plus  anyone who does porn is blacklisted in hollywood .  br    br   the most ridiculous thing about the movie is probably the casting of a tan  skinned latina as devon  s mother . sonja fisher does not seem like an actress at all . all in all  this movie is soft  core porn and is no better than something you would see on skinemax . i think even alex wilson  probably the best thing about this movie  is embarrassed by it and doesn  t want to be associated with it . there is no photo on his imdb page and nothing else listed  so alex wilson is probably a disposable stage name . plus  i ran into him in west hollywood one time recently and when i mentioned this movie  he just turned around and walked away . i understand . if i had worked on this movie  i would be embarrassed and wouldn  t want to be associated with it either .  ,0
this is a bigger budgeted film than usual for genre director honda  with more evidently elaborate sets   though the special effects still have that distinctive cheesiness to them  witness the giant bats and rodents on display  . it also utilizes a surprising number of american actors joseph cotten playing the visionary scientist looks ill  at  ease and frail  but  then  his character is supposed to be    years old    an innocuous richard jaeckel is the photographer hero while  as chief villains  we get cesar romero and patricia medina  both essentially campy  . as i  ve often said  i grew up watching english  language films dubbed in italianbut hearing hollywood actors in japanese is another thing entirely   br    br   latitude zero feels like a juvenile version of a typical jules verne adventure  and is fairly entertaining on that level indeed  it  s preferable to honda  s low  brow variations on the monsters  on  the  rampage formula because of the inherent quaint charm of the set  up in this case . the plot involves the kidnapping of a famous scientist by romero  he was intended to establish himself in the underwater  technologically advanced city devised by cotten  to which the world  s foremost minds are being recruited  . we  re treated to plenty of silly battles between the rival subs  but the most amusing scenes are certainly the raid on romero  s cave  in fact  cotten doing somersaults and fending off men in rubber suits  via flames and laser emitted from his glove   must surely count as the nadir of his acting career the other elder in the cast  romero  is more in his element  after all  he had been the joker in the batman tv series and movie of the     s  cotten has a scantily  clad blonde physician on his team  and is assisted by a hulking asian romero  on the other hand  is flanked by an oriental femme fatale  who  however  ends up getting a raw deal for her efforts  the girl  s brain is eventually transplanted into a hybrid of lion and condorwhich is among the phoniest  looking creatures you ever saw   . apparently  a   disc set of this one from media blasters streets on this very day    ,0

those who love the book jane eyre as i do  it  s my all time favorite  and i re read it at least once a year  will love this version . timothy dalton is just a tad too good looking to be mr . rochester  but other than that  he does a marvelous job portraying the brooding master of thornfield . zelah clarke may have been just a little too old to play the   year old jane  but when i watch this movie  i don  t think about the ages of the characters . the dialog from the film is taken almost verbatim from the book  which was very smart . sure  this film might seem a little long  but it  s the only version i  ve seen that includes part  of the story .  br    br   i wish the people who made this film had been involved in the newer zeferelli version  as it would have helped that mess of a film .  br    br   i also realized the last time i watched this video that judy cornwell plays  aunt reed   she is so versatile that i didn  t recognize her . she plays daisy in keeping up appearances  and also played mrs . musgrove in      s persuasion  another wonderful adaption  .  br    br   update got the dvd this week  and it  s marvelous to see the original unedited version . there  s lots more at the beginning  young jane at gateshead and at lowood .  and at the end  they  ve restored lots of things   i always wondered why st . john had a slip of paper when he reveals that he knows who jane is   because the part where he tears it from her painting was edited out of the us vhs version   . rosamund oliver is in it . . . she was completely cut out of the vhs . as far as i could tell  they hadn  t edited out any of timothy dalton  s parts  so nothing new there  but it is great to see the whole miniseries in its entirety after all these years of enjoying the vhs . thanks  bbc  ps . . . i would have paid more for a special edition dvd . . . with maybe some interviews with the stars . . . or a making of show   ,1
hong kong directors crossing over to hollywood to make movies is nothing new  with the temporary exodus of the likes of tsui hark  john woo  ringo lam in the   s . from their collective output  only a few movies  or may i say just one   made an impact at the box office . the andrew lau and alan mak partnership has been a tour de force in recent hk cinematic history  especially with their now famous infernal affairs trilogy which was remade into martin scorsese  s the departed  so it  s no surprise when hollywood comes knocking on the door .  br    br   but without fellow collaborator mak  who usually has script  story duties  how did lau fare with writers hans bauer and craig mitchell  it  s like the x  files without the x  in the way the story is crafted  the characters and the parallels drawn with the chris carter series . richard gere and claire danes pair up ala david duchovny and gillian anderson  only that they don  t belong to any federal investigative agency who bear arms  but are employees of protective services  who  s chief role is to ensure that sexual predators who belong to their jurisdiction  are kept safe from society when they are released from having served time . hence they are the shepherds tending to their flock  only that their flock suffer from sick sexual perversion with the propensity for violence .  br    br   the parallels in characterization are so blatantly obvious  that it  s just a cosmetic touch up on the outside . like fox mulder  gere  s erroll babbage is a strange  lonely man  consumed by his obsession in his quest to doggedly harass his flock to tote the line . pained by a failed attempt to rescue a missing child  just like how mulder pines for his missing sister  babbage is shunned by colleagues and given the marching orders disguised as a retirement plan . he has deep disgust for the people he  s monitoring  sick of their crimes and what they stand for  that he has no qualms in using unorthodox methods  short of flying off the handle while dishing out illegal  preemptive punishment . at the same time  he too has strong urges that he has to fight against  in order not to cross the line into becoming like those he loathes . as part of routine  he also scans newspapers and tabloids for clues and leads toward his objective  that of seeking closure  salvation for himself  and possessing a strong belief that the truth is still out there  and he wants to believe .  br    br   danes  allison lowry on the other hand  is the ingnue brought in to replace babbage . but in the meantime while learning the ropes on the job for the next   days  she is required to spy on him  and to report his shenanigans  pretty much like what dana scully was tasked to do with fox mulder . as the disbeliever of pre  emptiveness and holding onto the notion that those discharged back to society have been cured of their temptations  she slowly starts to see what babbage sees  and understands that it takes a whole lot more than being just a desk and administrative job if she truly wants to help people .  br    br   and it is this discovery of the world of fetishes and deviant sexual practices  that we open all our eyes to  much like how  mm starring nicolas cage brought snuff films into the spotlight . it  s a decent investigative drama with the usual red herrings  and my  are they really good ones as it made you wonder quite often if your guesses are correct  and you soon find yourself firing from the hip as you get proved incorrect at alarming frequency  though i don  t credit this to a tight narrative  but more from the sprawling number of characters  watch out for avril lavigne  s cameo  and sub plots . the scene in the darkened ware  shophouse was akin to se  en  s david mills and william somerset when they raided john doe  s apartment and find plenty of bizarreness inside  though here  given the subject nature  it wasn  t lingered upon much .  br    br   apparently  the flock somehow decided that enrique chediak  s cinematography was good enough  despite its very strange style of having no style  utilizing almost every trick in the book to try and recreate feelings of watching another se  en  only that this was deeply steeped in tinges of brown  rather than the doom and gloom of black . it does take a little while to get used to this  and i put this effect as one which actually distracts from what is happening in the story . not a really good move though  with somewhat frequent repetition of scenes involving flashbacks .  br    br   but the flock still makes decent entertainment  though x  philes out there would probably find it hard not to picture their favourite actors in the lead roles  given so much similarities in character . gere and danes do put forth some chemistry as the old fogey  heh  and his protg  and while it  s not exactly great  andrew lau did manage to pull off something enjoyable .  ,1
it seems like anybody can make a movie nowadays . it  s like all you need is a camera  a group of people to be your cast and crew  a script  and a little money and walla you have a movie . problem is that talent isn  t always part of this equation and often times these kind of low budget films turn out to be duds . the video store shelves are filled with these so called films . these aren  t even guilty pleasures  they  re just a waste of celluloid that are better off forgotten . troma entertainment is known for making trash cinema  but most of their films are b movie gold . however  some of the films they  ve put out they had nothing to do with making and some  like  nightmare weekend   didn  t deserve any form of release at all .  br    br   pros the cast members do the best they can with the lousy material . some unintentional hilarity . moves at a good pace  should at   minutes  .  br    br   cons awful writing  which includes putrid dialogue and countless plot holes . poorly lit  especially the night scenes and the ending  which you can  t make out at all . doesn  t make a lick of sense . badly scored . cheap and very dated effects . total lack of character development and you won  t care about anybody . this is supposed to be a horror film  but it  s lacking in that area and isn  t the least bit scary . nothing interesting or exciting happens . loaded with unnecessary padding .  br    br   final thoughts i never expected this to be some forgotten gem  but i never imagined it would be this bad . i don  t know if it  s the worst film ever made  but it  s a definite contender . troma should have let this film rot instead of giving it a release . don  t make the same mistake i did and let your curiosity get the best of you .  br    br   my rating     ,0
as the jacket proclaims  this film is  gorgeously shot and masterfully edited   and  yes  it is mesmerizingly beautiful . the timelessness that we perceive in stoic rock and in the unceasing ebb and flow of water frames the ephemeral works from goldsworthy  s hands so that in their very ephemeralness they point to eternity .  br    br   and so the beauty of his compositions haunt us with just a touch of melancholy woven in   or in the words of matthew arnold from  dover beach    br    br   listen  you hear the grating roar of pebbles which the waves draw back  and fling  at their return  up the high strand  begin  and cease  and then again begin  with tremulous cadence slow  and bring the eternal note of sadness in .  br    br   at one point near the end of the film goldsworthy says that  words do their job  but what i  m doing here says a lot more .  as a wordsmith myself i take no offense and not for a moment do i think him immodest because the combination of form and time and change and texture and color and composition that goldsworthy painstakingly and intuitively creates  is indeed something more than mere words can say .  br    br   at another point he remarks on  what is here to stay . . . and what isn  t .  that is his theme .  br    br   i think that artists sometime in the twentieth century became acutely aware of how ephemeral even the greatest works of art are compared to the vast expanse of cosmic time and so they began to reflect this understanding by composing works that were deliberately ephemeral . the idea was  that by emphasizing how short  lived are even the mightiest works of humans  a sense of the timelessness of art would be expressed .  br    br   perhaps part of the effectiveness of goldsworthy  s work is in this sort of expression . he painstakingly composes some form of straw or leaves where the tide will reach it  or places it in the river where it will be swept away and in this process is merged both the composition and its ephemerality .  br    br   both the transitory and the timeless are necessary for us to understand our world and our place within it . and it is important that these works be done within the context of nature so that what is composed is set within what is natural . thus the walls of stone and the eggs of stone that goldsworthy constructs are silent and solid yet we know that they are not monuments to eternity  but instead will stay for some undefined length of time and then dissipate and return to a state much like that which existed before we came along .  br    br   this is art as art should be  akin to the spiritual .  br    br   in a sense goldsworthy  s work is an inarticulated understanding . it is an experience purely of time and form . in a sense his work  answers  shelley  s famous poem  ozymandias  by saying  even as the tide washes the work away  and even as the river dissipates the expression  even so the art lives on because of our experience of it . similarly one thinks of tibetan sand paintings so carefully composed and measured out  and then just as they are so beautifully and preciously finished  they are given to the wind  so that we might know that all is flux .  br    br   yet  in the modern world these works of art endure in photos and videos . goldsworthy is an accomplished photographer  of necessity i would say  and all his works  even the unsuccessful ones  he tells us  are photographed so that he can look back at them in a more reflective mood and see what he has accomplished and what he has not .  br    br   this cinematic production directed by thomas riedelsheimer with the beautiful and appropriately haunting music by fred frith is not to be missed . it is one of the most beautiful documentaries that i have ever seen and one of the most spiritual .  ,1
it  s been nearly   years  and i still hate everyone involved in this movie . it remains the worst movie i  ve ever seen .  br    br   before seeing this  i never much minded rivers  one way or the other . after seeing this movie  i have an allergic reaction when i accidentally see her on television .  br    br   i got dragged to this  against my better judgment  by peer pressure . however  coming out of the theater  those friends swore an oath to never again overrule my choice of movie . nearly thirty years later  we still carry around mental scars from this movie .  br    br   on my deathbed  one of my regrets will be the time i wasted hoping that this movie might get better . it never did .  br    br   if you are ever given a choice  you would prefer putting your own eyes out to sitting though this movie .  br    br   i registered for imdb comments just in the hope that perhaps i can warn others against viewing this movie . if i can save just one person from watching this  then my existence on this earth will have been justified .  ,0
spoilers spoilers this is without a doubt the best film rainer werner fassbinder ever made and even with the marvelous script the film is enhanced by a great performance by hanna schygulla . film starts out with maria  schygulla  and hermann braun  klaus lowitsch  just getting married as the bombs continue to fall and hermann is shipped out towards the waning days of the war and now maria and her mother and sister must scrape by to survive . maria decides to get a job as a dancer  prostitute in a club that caters to american gi  s and she meets a black army soldier named bill  greg eagles  and they start to see one another on a steady basis . maria hears that her husband hermann has died in the war so she gets very serious with bill . but one day while getting intimate with bill they see hermann at the door . he hasn  t died and when he enters the room a scuffle occurs and maria breaks a bottle over bill  s head and he dies . hermann takes the blame and he is sentenced to a long term in jail so maria tells him that she will succeed at something and get him out . the war has ended and germany must rebuild and one day on a train maria meets karl oswald  ivan desny  who is a successful businessman in textiles and she uses her charms to get a job . maria is determined to do well and climbs the corporate ladder and becomes karl  s mistress . she tells him that she will never marry him but he is in love with her . hermann gets out of jail but goes to canada to try and get over everything that maria has done since he has been locked up .  br    br   spoiler alert  br    br   one day karl dies and leaves maria just about everything in his will and maria buys her own house . then hermann finally comes home to his wife and they are both ready to start they  re marriage even though they have been married for some time now . but maria leaves the gas on the stove and the house explodes with both of them still in it .  br    br   there are so many interesting things in this film that its one of those movies that can be studied and talked about to great lengths . like in all fassbinder films the use of color is used in a very interesting way . as the film begins the tones are brown and gray to represent war torn germany but as maria starts to become successful they change to bright rich colors like red and white . the rebuilding of germany with all the sounds of construction are used as only backdrop and the film stays focused on the exploits of maria . fassbinder did want the sounds of rebuilding to remind us of what was going on in germany at that time . hanna schygulla was never better and her performance is the key to the success of this film . with a lesser actress this would have been just another interesting film but schygulla is so strong that her performance elevates this film to an elite status . schygulla shows maria as very determined and smart but at the same time she uses her beauty and femininity to get what she wants . she  s not embarrassed nor does she feel guilty about this and fassbinder wanted to show maria as a woman who practically sells her soul to survive . schygulla wasn  t nominated for an academy award but she gave a great performance that will stand the test of time . fassbinder himself appears in the film as a peddler and his own mother lilo pempeit plays frau ehmke . i have heard many things about the ending of the film and it has to do with whether maria purposely left the gas on . later in the bathroom she is running water over her wrist and she appears to be sad . this is only speculation and if you think i  m wrong please e  mail me . i think she was overly excited by hermann being home and left it on by accident  remember her putting on a dress for no reason   . then when the will is being read to her its at that point that she learns that hermann and karl had become friendly without her knowledge and i think she felt that everything she had done was for nothing . thats the reason for the bathroom scene . so when the house explodes its by accident . but i think the reason for fassbinder having an ending like that is to show that anyone who would sell their soul has no business living . fassbinder was fascinated by survivors but he was also incredibly passionate . in his view maria can  t have it both ways . a fascinating film .  ,1
america needs the best man possible to win  the game  so who do they hire  a gymnast  oh brother   played by kurt thomas who has the necessary skills to win in a game which involves ninjas  a village of crazies and richard norton who is told by kurt thomas  to keep his hardware in his pants .   his exact words  i missed this in theaters and it  s a good reason because i would have probably been kicked out due to the laughing i broke into at regular intervals . the first thing that went through my mind was just how lame these ninjas are if a gymnast can kick their ass . kurt thomas is like  foot  and he hardly strikes one as  the best man for the job  as to the acting talent of kurt thomas  well if you can  t say something nice . . . in all seriousness though one has to wonder how much cocaine was being used to furnish an idea so stupid . only the decision to cast tara reid as a scientist tops the dumbness here . for   years though this held the title of the dumbest movie i had ever seen . not to say i didn  t find this unwatchable  i was laughing so hard i almost choked to death . twice . only in the    s could a movie with such a bad idea get made . although for the record it is the only movie to ever feature a hero so wimpy  he can  t even pull a wedged sword out from the ground . this is the wimpiest action movie ever made  and one of the most hilarious also .  br    br    out of    bad   ,0
this was an awful movie . basically jane march was a half  korean north korean spy sent by kim jong il to do something horrible to the american forces in south korea . she becomes a maid for an american military family  they all regard her as being korean even though she looks more white  i believe the actress is either    or    southeast asian  not at all korean   and the teenage boy of the household starts out hating her and ends up sleeping with her . the way korea and the u . s . military in korea is depicted is completely insane . of course  the screenwriter and the director were obviously white men who  ve never spent a day in korea prior to this movie and had no intention of showing any real insight into life in korea for either koreans or american gis and instead just tried to fulfill their pathetic asiaphile fantasies without any regard to how completely unbelievable it made the movie . anyone who  s ever been to korea will know this is utter garbage . in the end the north korean honhyol spy  girl gets killed  in an obvious  paying for her sins  way . very bad film with a made  for  tv feel to it .  ,0
a realistic depiction of young love for the college set but also appealing to an older viewer like me . it has ups and downs and twists and turns and made me shed a tear or two . we rarely see movies with black urban characters that could appeal to older  non black audiences and show a more real life depiction of young black adults .  br    br   this movie takes place on a college campus and town where two people meet and fall in love . in the background are various friends acquaintances and situations that impact them for better or worse . typical plot some may say  but this really was unexpected .  br    br   i found myself rooting for the survival of the couple  s relationship  seeing my own past in their story . moments of deep thought and revelation came pouring out of the actors performances .  br    br   it  s a bright film that i would endorse for those young at heart and in love or have ever been in love . great movie . i  ll be looking for a copy to add to my movie collection .  ,1
the premise for circle of two is an intriguing one . a forbidden love between a sixty year old painter ashleigh  richard burton  and a fifteen year old girl sarah norton  tatum o  neill   and the question of whether such a relationship is acceptable given society  s standards . the problem with circle of two  however  is that it fails to live up to its promise . director jules dassin and hedley should have put more thought into the screenplay . when i watched this film  i expected to learn something new about love and sexuality . instead  i got boring dialogue  a pointless lecture on art  outings where sarah seemed to have more fun away from ashleigh  and a closing scene so artificial that its emotional impact was lost . this script makes good actors look bad . so one can imagine how the film  s problems were compounded even further with the largely amateurish cast that jules dassin assembled . tatum o  neill was not in her element . i did not believe for a second that her character sarah was in love with ashleigh . her performance seemed superficial  like a contestant at a beauty pageant . it was as though she forced herself to be happy  when the script required her to be happy  and to be sad  when the script asked her to be sad . the only scene i liked with her in was at the very end when she said nothing at all . that was probably the closest tatum  s sarah norton ever came to being real . but tatum was not the only one at fault . richard burton  s ashleigh lacked the charm  the charisma and the complexity to attract even women of his own age  let alone a fifteen year old . the rest of the cast was also dismal . even their arguing was unconvincing  because they waited to take turns . who does that  michael wincott as the jealous ex  boyfriend paul was probably the best thing in this film  but his role was small . to be fair to the actors  dassin  s direction let everyone down but it is also true that a great movie goes beyond the script . kubrick  s lolita did that with james mason and sue lyon konchalovsky  s runaway train went beyond the script with jon voight and eric roberts playing convicts . the directors of these films also knew how to use music to dramatize their films and reveal something about the characters in them . in spite of its own score  a combination of antonio vivaldi  carl off and bernard hoffer   circle of two never succeeds in doing that .  br    br   in conclusion  the idea of a forbidden love story between an elder painter and a teenage girl is a good one  but its execution in circle of two is terrible . in many ways  it is a shame that a controversial  lolita  type story  which most film directors for understandable reasons would prefer to avoid  did not have receive more intelligent treatment that a script which actors would have gladly rehearsed was not written that actors  who were committed to their part or had the talent to make their characters real  could not be found and that the director jules dassin  who did so much better with films like rififi and topkapi  did not have to will to put his foot down and say   before we do any filming  we must rethink the love story and revamp the script .  the only silver lining is that one day an intelligent film about an elder painter and a teenager girl falling in love may one day be made . if such a film ever appears  this it will be surely spark controversy  debate and questions for many years to come .  ,0

baba  rajinikanth will never forget this name in his life . this is the movie which caused his downfall . it was released with much hype but crashed badly and laid to severe financial losses for its producers and distributors . rajinikanth had to personally repay them for the losses incurred . soon after its release  he tried venturing into politics but failed miserably . its a very bad movie with horrible acting  bad  quality makeup and pathetic screenplay . throughout the movie  rajinikanth looks like a person suffering from some disease . i  m one of the unfortunate souls who saw baba  first day first show in theatre . the audiences were so bored that most of them left the theatre before the intermission . sorry  i  ll not recommend this one to anyone .  ,0
i was rooting for this film as it  s a remake of a     s children  s tv series  escape into night  which  though chaotic and stilted at times was definitely odd  fascinating and disturbing . the acting in  paperhouse  is wooden  unintentionally a joke . the overdubs didn  t add tension they only reinforced that i was sat watching a botch . casting exasperated the dreary dialogue which resulted in relationships lacking warmth  chemistry or conviction . as in most lacklustre films there are a few good supporting acts these people should be comforted  consoled and reassured that they will not be held responsible . out of all the possible endings the most unexpected was chosen . . . lamer than i could have dreamt .  br    br    escape into night  deserves a proper remake  written by someone with life experience and directed with a subtle mind .  ,0
having not seen all the films released in      i can  t say that this is the best film of the year . i can say that it is the best film i have seen all year .  br    br   most american films featuring black people either obsess over the american preoccupation with  race relations   or fall into the cliches of the inner city ghetto  with every sterotype imaginable spouting ebonic  phrased slang . antwone fisher stands proudly alone in this regard race is irrelevant  save for one fight that may  or may not  have been provoked by a racial slur .  br    br   antwone fisher  s story is one that should find resonance with any empathic individual . he is understatedly  and thoughtfully  portrayed by derek luke . denzel washington  while obviously using his star power to have the film made  sticks to the background for the most part  and allows the film to be the antwone fisher story .  br    br   at a time when bet  and popular culture in general want to maintain the ghetoization of a large number of americans  and canadians too  you know   this is a film that speaks to the humanity in all of us . i just hope that the non  black audience will go see this film for that humanity  rather than avoiding it because they feel that there are no characters or actors in the movie whom they can identify with . that would be a sad commentary on race  relations in north america in and of itself .  br    br    ,1
okay  as a long time disney fan  i really  hate  direct  to  video disney sequels . walt himself didn  t believe in them . he believed in  and they lived happily ever after  being the end of it . but this one . . . really ticked the taco . there were so many ripoffs of other disney films in this  it wasn  t funny . quick summary  if you don  t already know . . .  melody  the daughter of ariel and prince eric  is born . ursula  s sister  morganna  who basically looks like ursula  if she were to dye herself green and go on the ally macbeal starvation diet  shows up and  after trying to do the newborn tyke in  and failing  prophesizes doom for the characters . after that ordeal  ariel goes into a lapse of being like her father  and refuses to tell melody about her mermaid heritage  and later on  forbids her to go near the sea . well surprise surprise . melody finds out  being the stubborn brat she is  and runs away  then makes a deal with morgana to become a mermaid  in exchange for something .  gee does that sound familiar   she becomes one  but in her half of the bargain  has to retrieve her granddaddy  s trident and bring it back to the sea witch . while doing this  she runs into a couple of outcast animals  a penguin and a walrus named timon and pumb   huh  wait . . . no  that  s not timon and pumbaa  or is it  could of fooled me . anyway  i  d like to reveal more  but pretty much anything that could be guessed to happen does . ok so . . . long story short . this movie  borrows  too much from other  better  disney films . . . and does it horribly . come on . . . tip and dash  why not just make dash obscenely flatulent and make it an even more obvious ripoff  ugh . not to mention  the total character butchery of ariel  s persona . she  s gone from being a freespirited  headstrong woman  to a clone of her father . not good at all . . . they  re basically telling us the sweet  firey little mermaid we  ve known to grow and love is dead . plus melody herself isn  t such a great character either . . . she  s damned annoying  and bratty  not to mention what they  ve done to flounder . ugh . . . anyway if you decide to see this piece of created  mainly  for  profit  reasons  no  imagination  eisner  sponsored ct  i suggest maybe waiting  till its on the disney channel or some other tv station . because  it  s not even worth the price of a rental .  br    br    out of  stars .  ,0
this is one of the most calming  relaxing  and beautifully made animation films i  ve ever seen . with beautiful music throughout the movie  the sounds and music can make you feel like you  re in the movie  this movie is not just great for kids  but adults too . it teaches you lessons  such as never forget who you are  you can do whatever you stick your mind to  and to brave and daring . this movie can make you cry at times too  which is always a nice touch in movies . this movie is funny  sad  cute  and keeps you on the edge of your seat  some movies really give you a fuzzy feeling after you see them  and the movie  spirit  is definitely one of them  with my vote of     stars for animation  music  and a wonderful idea for a movie  it gave me a whole lot of spirit   ,1

spoilers sex huh  it  s one of the most basic parts of human life . yet  do we ever take it too seriously  people always want more  even those who get it on a daily basis  and if you are unlucky  there are potential life changing  creating  consequences . ironically people claim we are all starting to have sex at a younger and younger age  despite victorians getting married and having children in their early teens   so it must be increasingly difficult for those who get to a point as virgins . in steve carell  s first big screen lead  he plays a man who has gotten to   without managing it . treating us to countless lude and extreme sex related incidents  not to mention more profanity than an episode of  eurotrash   the general plot of the film and it  s principle doesn  t sound funny . it  s a pleasant surprise therefore that for all the inappropriate  failed jokes  there are an incredibly large number of ones which hit the mark and leave the audience in hysterics .  br    br   andy stitzer  carell  is a nice guy with a good job and a pleasant temperament . at the same time though  he blatantly takes life too seriously and after being invited to a poker game as a necessary fifth member  andy  s friends discover his secret . at the age of    andy is still a virgin . now  for multiple reasons  but mostly pity  the three men  paul rudd  seth rogen and romany malco  all offer andy advice with one goal in mind . to put him out of his misery and get him laid .  br    br   one of the few good things about  anchorman   it was only going to be a matter of time before steve carell got himself a lead of his own . impressively  in  the   year old virgin  he doesn  t disappoint . showing the hopeless  shy virgin to perfection  carell is a revelation as he gradually grows increasingly confident as the advice begins to help .  br    br   carell is not alone however in his performance . rudd  rogen  malco and catherine keener as the love interest are all superb . rudd is a personal favourite as the love sick david who falls apart at multiple times and shares the finest scene with rogen as the two argue over homosexuality .  br    br   the biggest surprise about this film is not the way that so many of the jokes hit the mark  but actually the clever way that it flips the message on it  s head . obviously designed for conservative america  the film  s entire tone evolves from a simple story of sexual conquest into one of safe sex and abstinence . the virgin doesn  t need sex to make his life complete  he just needs confidence and true love . a worthy message to preach  and a considerable improvement on the one you expect to see at the beginning of the film .  br    br   it  s weird to see a crude comedy which is consistently funny and well acted  but low and behold     year old virgin  is just that . throw in a well meaning message too and you  re well on the way to a top class comedy . a surprising joy .  ,1
the only scenes wich made me laugh where the ones with christopher walken in it  the crazy filmdirector  the rest of the movie was just boring . in the first hour or so nothing really happens . jokes which supposed to be funny aren  t and zeta jones douglas is really overacting . julia roberts does a routine job of the former ugly duck  yeah right   into the girl next door  where did i see this before   who gets the guy . for short . i really didn  t care what would happen with the main characters . if cusack really fell of the building in a suicide attempt the movie could have been more interresting to watch .  ,0
 firstly  although many say it is the worst of the series  i don  t think that it is true  considering this one ideally reflects the   century teen mentality . it brings perfect opportunities to make you laugh and remind you of the good teenager times when you would have liked to have same fun as the characters do .  br    br    i agree with the fact that it is a teenager movie but comedy movies nowadays aren  t supposed to be for teenagers  i mean . . . cinemas are mostly the place for teenagers to hang out plus  seeing such a movie during a sleepover or something like that is very good for having a very good time .  br    br    many comment about the amount of nudity in this movie . well . . . let  s get real . . . doesn  t that reflect the thoughts of teen guys like those from the movie  what would you like to see . . . smart books  romantic stuff  that is not at all what would be in those teenagers  minds . . .  br    br    to conclude  i think that if you are a teenager  you must absolutely see the movie  and even if you are a real grown up man or a woman  you should see it if you still have a teen mind or you often think about how it was being a teenager  or things like that . thanks for reading   ,1
i only today  picked this up at the   cents only store today  and i still think i got ripped off .  dream to believe  is a pretty boring and unrealistic gymnastics drama and   is just too freakin  expensive for this . this film is probably only notable for  things  . it has a young keanu reeves . and  . it  s directed by paul lynch  the man who also did promo night . now onto the movie .  br    br   it  s about a girl named robin  played by olivia d  abo  who is badly injured from a car accident that also cost her father  s life . so the accident prevents her from competing in gymnastic tournaments  she is often picked on during her classes and eventually she meets some wild kid named tommy  played by keanu .  robin  when not in training  works part  time  along with her mother and stepsister  at a laundromat owned by her abusive stepfather . eventually she is chosen to compete .  br    br   overall  keanu alone and some catchy   s tunes are what prevent me from giving this  star  and it  s also not one of the worst movies ever  but still far from good . the dvd itself is not getting any medals either as it appears to be sourced from an old vhs and towards the end  the sound goes out of sync and when the end credits are almost over  it fades to black  even though sound can still be heard . so this can probably be passed as a bootleg . the dvd artwork makes no sense either as it has what appears to be recent photos of keanu and olivia and the background has nothing to do with the movie  as it  s also not in the movie itself  so the cover  s obviously photoshopped . in any case  avoid at all costs  unless you  re a keanu fanatic . i probably won  t be hanging to it any longer . i  m probably gonna give it to the cinema snob  who  s a great yt critic btw . hey  if any of you have any crappy movies that they no longer want in their sight  feel free to donate to him to keep his show running .  ,0
as most off you might off seen star wars return off the jedi you may knows its a good movie but as you might have seen on video they mmight have a party at the end and they just probably end the movie with the party with no a spirits or anything but on the original one  live tv  when they are partying but before i say more when ben obi  wan dies in the imperial ship or death star they saw him disappear and yoda dies from either old age or internal illness but because luke killed darth vader  real name anakin skywalker  when they all are partying at the end when luke or someone stops the spirits off ben and yoda stands starring at him and smiling while another spirit appears is its darth vader but not as a sith as the old usual selve off him and started smiling with ben and yoda i reckon that made the movie ending a little bit interesting but the producers or anyone should off made a spirit off padme and mace windu and other jedis that got killed with younglings under there arms in the back ground  ,1
this documentary makes you travel all around the globe . it contains rare and stunning sequels from the wilderness . it shows you how diversified and how fragile our planet can be . the polar bear  s future is highlighted at the beginning and at the end of it . after all  its bleak future is closely linked with the consequences of global warming . this documentary is however a simplistic approach of such a serious environmental issue . it can nonetheless be easily seen by young children since it mainly remains descriptive . scientists might well be disappointed as it is not a remake of al gore  s documentary  an inconvenient truth  but frankly . . . what a description    a question may then arise isn  t it worth preserving our world  s beauty  because this documentary proves that in     such a beauty still exists despite the different pollutions . by living in towns and cities we tend to forget that we are part and parcel of this nature . all things considered this documentary reminds us that we own a common treasure called  earth  .  ,1

i anticipated this movie to be decent and possibly clich  but i was completely wrong  charlie cox  i had never heard of him until now  played an incredibly good leading man he was so earnest and romantic  me and my friend that saw the movie with me totally fell in love with him .  br    br   claire danes  who i did like before  loved her in romeo and juliet   made me enjoy her even more . her acting was fantastic  i couldn  t even tell that she was american . the chemistry between her and charlie cox was extremely good  the casting was quite perfect .  br    br   robert deniro and michelle pfeiffer were equally well  casted deniro as that gay pirate . . . priceless  priceless . i laughed so hard at that one scene where septimus comes on the ship . . . oh my god  wow . pfeiffer played a decent villain  i liked her as the snippy mother in hairspray . but she had the right amount of melodrama and snide comments throughout the movie .  br    br   overall  it was funny  but not slap  stick at all    romantic  the special effects weren  t totally frequent but when they were  they were great the cameos from ricky gervais and peter o  toole were also well  placed .  br    br   i totally recommend this movie to anyone who likes fantasy movies like the princess bride or even lord of the rings . it kept my interest the entire time and i will be buying the dvd when it comes out   ,1
fans of creature feature films have to endure a lot of awful movies lately . blood surf shamelessly joins the list of stupid  redundant pulp  horror titles about ridiculously big animals that want to turn the food chain upside down . crocodiles are particularly successful as we already had to struggle our way through the abysmal  crocodile   directed by a disappointing tobe hooper  and  lake placid  . blood surf is every bit as bad as these other films and  on top of that  it likes to exaggerate tremendously . the saltwater  crocodile supposedly is   years old  over   ft long    and it kills for fun  during the film  he amuses himself by devouring a bunch of utterly stupid surfer  dudes  dudettes who came to seek new thrills by surfing in a shark  congested area . the only beautiful aspect about this film is the tropical location . even though it  s a completely inappropriate setting for a film like this  the lagoons and nature looks marvelous . every other aspect is simply disastrous . there  s a quite a bit of gore but it all looks fake and laughable . the dialogues are downright painful to listen to  you won  t believe some of the lines these actors have to say  i know surfers are supposed to be a mentally underdeveloped group but i hope for their own sake they  re not that stupid  early in the film  one of the characters refers to jaws as being a  mechanical toy  but the croc here looks at least   times less real than spielberg  s great white shark . the visual effects in  blood surf  are amateurish and the massacres fail to impress . i won  t say too much about the acting since it  s secondary in flicks like this . the girls look sexy in wet shirts and their boobs joyfully bounce while running away from the beast . you guessed right blood surf is a very bad film . so bad it becomes fun again . but  funny  for a whole other reason than james hickox intended .  ,0
this mindless movie is a piece of crap and boring like the full house repetitions . for all the people who want to see a great  exciting and cool horror movie shouldn  t even think about watching this bunch of mindless work . a f  in my opinion . i have one question  what were they thinking  let  s make a list   bad script   bad script   bad script   bad acting   bad directing and last but not least a bad script . i mean i am not like grumping about every movie  but i was disappointed when i watched it . this movie should be banned into a box  locked and sunk down into the sea . so please don  t do something like this again  please  please  please      ,0
 contains spoilers   br    br   the truly exquisite sean young  who in some scenes  with her hair poofed up  looks something like elizabeth taylor  is striking in her opening moments in this film . sitting in the back of a police car waiting to signal a bust  her face and body are tense and distracted . unfortunately  once the bust is over young  s strained demeanor never changes . this is one fatally inhibited actress .  br    br   one has only to compare young to the performer playing her coworker and best friend  arnetia walker  to grasp what is missing in young . walker is open  emotional  and at ease at all times . . . in that there  s no apparent barrier between what she may be feeling and her expression of it . she is an open book . young  on the other hand  acts in the skittish  self  conscious way you might expect your neighbor to act were they suddenly thrown into starring in a film . basically  she doesn  t have a clue .  br    br   with this major void looming at the center of the movie  we  re left to ponder the implausiblities of the story . for instance  after miss young is kidnapped by the criminal she  s trailing and locked in a closet  she breaks the door down when left alone . granted  she  s dressed only in a bra and panties  but in a similar situation  with a psycho captor due to return any moment  would you head for the door . . . or take the time to go through his dresser  take out some clothes and get dressed  i would guess that this and other scenes are trying to suggest some sort of mixed emotions miss young  s character is experiencing  but young can not convey this type of complexity .  br    br   there are a few affecting moments in the film  such as the short police interviews with the criminal  s past victims  but overall this is an aimless endeavor . it  s too bad miss young was replaced while filming the pair of comic book style films that might have exploited her limitations with some humor  batman and dick tracy   because her floundering while attempting to play actual people is oddly touching . watching miss young try to act  at least in this  thriller   is a sad spectacle .  ,0
this movie proves that good acting comes from good direction and this does not happen in ask the dust . colin farrell is usually a fine actor but in this he is juvenile . donald sutherland comes across as an amateur . why  because the script is awful  the adaptation is awful and the actors seem bored and half hearted . the atmosphere of the movie is bad  i could only think when it would finish and i turned it off half way . the director has done a very poor job and even though i have not read the novel it is certainly a missed chance . the atmosphere this film is trying to evoke and the message and storyline never reaches the audience . in one word  it is a terrible film .  ,0
  br    br   cheap  looking and ugly  this film didn  t even seem to entertain the kids in the audience  except for one fairly amusing toilet joke . christopher lloyd is way past his prime and actually quite tiresome in this role  although the sorry excuse for jokes by the writers don  t help .  elizabeth hurley is embarrassingly amateurish in a supposedly comic role . jeff daniels and darryl hannah avoid humiliation . there is really no reason to make this movie  especially since it is unavoidable that one will compare it with robin williams  s often brilliant improvisations in mork  mindy .  br    br    ,0
maybe it  s because i looked up the history of the irish troubles in the     s and then the sad civil war that engulfed the free state after the signing of the treaty before watching this movie . anyway  the sudden turn at the end brought tears to my eyes .  br    br   victor mclaglen isn  t as famous today as he was back then  and he should be better remembered . in this film  i think he  s playing himself as he would have been without his innate talent and brains . for example  the scenes where his buddy in the crowd is challenging men to fight with him is probably quite reminiscent of what mclaglen actually did in earlier years  when he was a world  class bare  knuckles boxer . john ford is partly responsible for that the imdb trivia section shows how he tricked mclaglen into getting a really bad hangover for the trial scene . this director also could bring out a lot in his actors  even without such tricks . mostly  though  mclaglen is firmly in control  especially when his character is almost totally blotto  which is difficult for an actor to do believably   and he also plays gypo nolan with a depth and emotional power that is surprising for someone who has only seen mclaglen later in his career  in  the quiet man .  i especially like the contrast between this role as an ira man and the much more obviously controlled performance he gave as the ira man denis hogan in  hangman  s house .   br    br   in  the quiet man   of course  mclaglen is a country squire at odds with the local ira . victor mclaglen was big and bully  in the old  fashioned sense of the word  but he was a good actor  too  and capable of wide range and fine nuances of performance that we just wouldn  t expect of a such a man today . it  s a rather sad comment on our own set of expectations and prejudices .  br    br   ford  as usual  packs a lot into a little bit of film . all the characters are excellent  though the commandant  s mostly american accent is distracting    note there be spoilers ahead    knowing that gypo once drew the short straw and was ordered to kill a man but let him talk his way out of it instead  we really empathize with the man who draws the short straw for executing gypo  and the humanity he shows  most notably when they go to take gypo in mary  s room .  br    br   john ford really shows his genius here  taking what could have been a gruesome and yet expected outcome to the whole story and instead using it to set up a totally unexpected and yet very satisfying ending that makes us think not just of gypo and the other characters  but of poor ireland during that tortured time .  ,1
i have always been a fan of the show so i  ll admit that i am biased . when the show  s run ended  i felt like too many questions remained unanswered . this movie to me felt like closure . to see all the people i  d followed over the past few years together at last was most rewarding . i have heard that this is probably the only homicide movie that we can expect . if that is so  this is the appropriate way to go out . this movie is sometimes poignant  sometimes upsetting  but always satisfying . if you are or ever have been a fan of the show  watch this movie .  ,1
on the back burner for years  so it was reported  this television reunion of two of the most beloved characters in sitcom history started off badly  and went straight downhill from there . mary richards  mary tyler moore  and her best friend rhoda morgenstern  valerie harper  meet in new york after a long estrangement and catch up on each other  s lives . what a novel concept  but  sad to relate  nothing worth talking about  let alone making a movie about  has happened to either of them in the intervening years . so  instead  the script contents itself with throwing out one hoary old plot device after another  most having to do with older women in the workplace   while completely missing the quirky charm and sophistication that made the original show a winner . the supporting cast is instantly forgettable  the humor is nonexistent  and the chemistry which moore and harper once had together is gone . moore allegedly stalled this project for years  waiting for  just the right script  before committing herself . if this was the one she considered  right   what on earth were the ones she turned down like  it  s not the age of the characters that does this in  for time inevitably marches on   but the almost complete lack of imagination coupled with a blatant disregard for the elements that made the series work . at one time this was intended as a pilot but  all to obviously  it failed to generate any interest among potential sponsors . or for that matter  among potential audiences . quickly and mercifully forgotten  the film is a travesty and an insult to a classic .  ,0
  i love new york  is another entry by vh    mtv networks  showing the entertaining side of dating a shrill  obnoxious  woman . it must have been an easy decision to take the most wildest  ebonics speaking  craziest contestant  and her mother  and give them a show on this network . many will argue   this is a show  . true  it  s not as bad as it  s previous show   flavor of love   but it  s just as bad .  br    br   it reminds me of a skit from the    s show  in living color  where keenan ivory wayans was imitating the boxer mike tyson on  the love connection  dating show and he picked  robin givens  for a date . mike talked of how the date was okay  but how the obnoxious mother kept butting in . this show reminds me of that .  br    br   the men are chosen and given names to degrade themselves and the woman that they are dating more   i would think an intelligent man looking to date an intelligent woman would not allow her  and her mother  to give you a name that is so ghetto  you  ll embarrass yourself every time you appear on tv .  but these are professional reality actors  so why bother .  br    br   it escapes me to discover what is so entertaining about all of this . the fact that this is as fake as her newly implanted additions    minutes of fame and hundreds of thousands of dollars in ad time for the network   well  you can  t hate them for trying to make a buck .  maybe the wonder is  who would want to be with this woman past an hour  or wonder if she and her mother  s next show would be on the wwf  any way you slice it  it  s a train wreck you  ve seen countless times before so by now the shock value is down to nil .  br    br   no twist or turn will make this a more interesting train wreck  or any different from any of the others . appeals to the lowest common denominator and for those calling an  end  to reality shows  this is just another nail in the coffin as to why they should end  immediately .  ,0
i  d been following this films progress for quite some time so perhaps expected a little too much . i consider both gillian anderson and danny dyer to be good at what they do and was interested to see what dan reed could come up with but unfortunately it just didn  t work for me .  br    br   the problem lies in the fact that the film doesn  t really seem to understand which genre it  s falling into and as such it fails to impress on drama  horror and thriller elements because rather than focusing on one of them and doing it well it  s a bit of a jack of all trades and master of none .  br    br   the premise  as with most revenge films  is simple  couple meet and go out  something bad happens and they get their revenge it  s a simple formula and one that many directors have handled expertly over the years . unfotunately in this case it  s as if dan reed thought   it  d be great to do one of those revenge films that goes a little deeper by showing a more human side to all the characters and delving into their mental state in more detail . . . .  wrong  there are also a few key elements missing  in this type of movie there  s generally some kind of warning . a don  t do this or this might happen element which adds to the tension but there  s nothing of the sort here . it just simply happens  then nothing happens for an hour  then something interesting happens and then it ends .  br    br   there  s a lot of really stiff competition in this genre and hats of to dan reed for trying  i have no issue with his directing abilities but in term of writing . . . i  d say next time he should stick to the formula for the type of film he  s making instead of trying to be too clever and he  ll have a quality movie on his hands .  ,0

no redeeming qualities can possibly be expressed . i wish i could get my time back . nice skull face broad really smiles  bright at the camera when the disease has already wreaked enough havoc on the ill informed script . i was   spoiler   happy to see all the characters dead or severely incapacitated by the end  especially the party poopers that drink the tainted juice on their way to the alleged sunset . eli roth does shine for moments of maybe ten  putting forth the theory on how well weed smokes in the woods when others really fiend on top of beer consumption . overall  i found most of it pointless  though not without gratuitous violence and not enough nudity  happy to witness the demise of cast  in a way though  wishing that journey never happened  probably should  ve been getting laid instead of watching tbs late night  ugh  .  ,0
there was nothing of value in the original movie  this one was even lamer . the fact that i even found it to rent was absolutely amazing . anyone connected to this film has to be high on something  so what was the story line  what was with the girl  was the viewer supposed to get the story line in the first four minutes of the film . sadly  i tried several times to watch this . i even borrowed a kid from someone to get some feedback . kid said it was stupid  and he was four years old . i find that possibly some credit could go to the filming director  as possibly some of the shots made the movie more than a b film . that might be pushing it . i did love the theme song . good thing it was only a dollar  it was worth it . i suppose you might enjoy the film if you were high as the cast and crew would have to be . is pot legal in france   ,0
i was not expecting much from this movie  but was very pleasantly surprised  as it is light and funny and very well observed . the central trio of deadbeat bikers were surprisingly likable as they staggered and clowned their way through their drug  centred trip to wales . the humour was gentle and subtle  as indeed were the three characters  witness their sympathetic treatment of the little old lady shopkeeper  . the atmospherics of rural wales were captured perfectly  and the soundtrack was very well chosen . cleverly and carefully scripted  with great attention to detail  i have never seen such a realistic portrayal of alternative culture  i felt i was there with them . very light in touch and full of fun  not what you might expect from a movie about bikers and drugs . a delight on all fronts  and difficult to criticise  though i thought the last two scenes were a bit lame  the film should have ended when they left wales . but overall  an unexpected treasure of a film .  ,1

bettie page was a icon of the repressed     s  when she represented the sexual freedom that was still a decade away  but high in the hopes and dreams of many teenagers and young adults . gretchen mol does a superb job of portraying the scandalous bettie  who was a small town girl with acting ambitions and a great body . her acting career went nowhere  but her body brought her to the peak of fame in an admittedly fringe field . photogrsphed in black and white with color interludes when she gets out of the world of exploitation in new york  this made  for  tv  hbo  film has good production values and a very believable supporting cast . the problem is  it  s emotionally rather flat . it  s difficult to form an attachment to the character  since bettie is portrayed as someone quite shallow and naive given the business she was in . the self  serving government investigations are given a lot of screen time  which slows down the film towards the end . but it  s definitely worth watching for the history of the time  and to see the heavy  handed government repression that was a characteristic of the fifties .      ,1

the footage fulci shot  added a lot of their own  zombi  ended up as nearly a straight      split . the script by fragasso is an absolute mess  none of it is well thought out  is just as stupid as it gets . the scenes of zombie birds attacking people are not only technically inept but the whole idea is just absurd . the zombies themselves have no consistency whatsoever  look at the scene where patricia is on the bridge  the zombies are slow as they shuffle along but then look at the scene earlier on where she was attacked by the zombie with the machete because that one runs around like it  s on steroids  then for no reasonable explanation about   minutes before the film finishes the zombies suddenly develop the ability to speak which also looks daft . there are so many things wrong with zombi   scene after scene of terribly thought out  ineptly directed action  awful character  s  really dull broken english dialogue which doesn  t make sense half the time . then there  s the embarrassing scene where the zombie head inside the fridge suddenly develops the ability to fly through the air  bite someones neck  the scene when the guy  s in white contamination suits at the end are about to kill kenny  roger but instead of using their automatic rifles they decide to try  kill them by hand  even when kenny picks up a gun himself they still refuse to use their rifles  when kenny starts to shoot them all they still refuse to use their rifles  it  s one of the most ineptly handled scenes ever put to film  then there  s the end where kenny takes off in the helicopter but can  t rest it down on the ground for literally a few seconds to pick his buddy up  then a load of zombies suddenly spring up from under some piles of grass  what  since when did zombies hide themselves yet alone under piles of grass  this all may sound  fun  but believe me it  s not  it  s a really bad film that is just boring  repetitive  simply doesn  t work on any level as a piece of entertainment except for a few unintentional laughs .  br    br   it  s hard to know who was responsible for what exactly but none of the footage is particularly well shot . it has a bland lifeless feel about it  for some reason the makers have tried to bath every scene in mist  the problem is they clearly only had one fog machine  you can see that at one corner of the screen the mist is noticeably thicker as it is coming straight out of the machine  thinning out as it disperses across the scene . since a lot of it is set during the day it doesn  t add any sort of atmosphere whatsoever  when they do get it right  the mist is evenly spread across the screen it just looks like they shot the scene on a foggy day  the direction is poor with no consistency  it just looks  feels bottom of the barrel stuff . even the blood  gore isn  t up to much  there  s a gory hand severing at the start  a scene when something rips out of a pregnant woman  s stomach  a legless woman  what actually took her legs off in the pool by the way  why didn  t it take the legs off the guy who jumped in to save her    a few ok looking zombies is as gory as it gets . for anyone hoping to see a gore fest the likes of which fulci regularly served up during the late    s  early    s will be very disappointed  there aren  t any decent feeding scenes  no intestines  no stand out  head shots   very little gore at all .  br    br   technically the film is poor  the special effects are cheap looking  the cinematography is dull  the music is terrible  the locations are bland  it has rock bottom production values . this was actually shot in the philippines to keep the cost down to a minimum . the entire film is obviously dubbed  the acting still looks awful though  the english version seems to have been written by someone who doesn  t understand the language that well .  br    br   zombi  is not a sequel to fulci  s classic zombie gore fest zombi         it has nothing to do with it at all apart from the cash  in title . i  m sorry but zombi  is an amateurish mess of a film  it  s boring  it makes no sense  it  s not funny enough to be entertaining  it lacks any decent gore . one to avoid .  ,0
jack london  s life was certainly colorful enough for a dozen films about different aspects of him . sad to say though that what his life was used for in film was some wartime propaganda that put the best face on some of the least attractive parts of his character .  br    br   jack london who barely saw the age of   when he died wrote some of the best stories around . he wrote on what he knew  but he also wrote as does everyone else bringing the baggage of his own life experience with him . some of that experience in another day and time would have been condemned as racism . but this was world war ii and london was a big believer in the  yellow peril  as it was called back in the day .  br    br   two thirds of the film covers his life as author  we see his years as a seaman from where he got the inspiration for the sea wolf . we see him up in the yukon in a miner  s cabin with a dog that was no doubt his inspiration for the call of the wild . london was able to capture the spirit of adventure that his own life was all about right on paper for the world to enjoy ever since .  br    br   the final third dealt with his time as a war correspondent covering the russo  japanese war . london was a socialist  but his socialism did not encompass folks who were oriental . like a few million others he saw the rising immigration of the chinese and japanese to our pacific coast as a threat to jobs for the white people . he advocated strict immigration policies for orientals .  br    br   the film puts the cart before the horse . london is presented as a man who saw because he was on hand at the russo  japanese war what japan  s ambitions were and for that reason was as xenophobic as he was . actually the kind of atrocities present in world war ii were not existent during the russo  japanese conflict . japan had her imperial ambitions  but so did everyone else including the usa at that time . but our immigration policies caused by pressure from our west coast politicians was a big contributing factor to the deterioration of relations with japan over a couple of generations . london was part of the cause not a prophet crying in the wilderness .  br    br   this film was the first independent production of samuel bronston who later did some films with a bit more budget than jack london . had he a bit more money bronston might have gotten james cagney or spencer tracy  both who would have been right for the role . instead they got michael o  shea who was making his second film after lady of burlesque . o  shea is fine in the part  but certainly was no box office .  br    br   as london is covering the war  he meets up with a captain tanaka who is played by leonard strong  an actor who specialized in orientals and played a ton of them in world war ii . from the vantage point in     strong outlines in the best fu manchu tradition japan  s imperial aims right up to taking on the usa eventually . must have gone over great with the swing shift crowd .  br    br   a lot of course is left out of london  s life including a first wife . playing the second and only wife in this film is susan hayward who only comes into the movie when it  s half over . i wish we  d have seen more of her . charmian kittredge london survived her husband by almost   years dying in     .  br    br   o  shea in fact met and married the leading lady of his life in jack london . virginia mayo has a small role in jack london and they married for   years until o  shea died in     .  br    br   maybe one day we  ll get a view of jack london that will be a lot better than this one .  ,0
i saw soylent green back in     when it was first released and maybe another eight times over the years on t . v . or video . it was always one of my favorite sci  fi and  or charlton heston films .  br    br   recently  the egyptian theater in l . a . had a twelve film charlton heston retrospective . i flew in from out of state to see six of the films over a two day period . soylent green looked great on the large egyptian screen with a perfect new print . from its opening montage to the going home scene to the great ending the film was fantastic .  br    br   charlton heston as a cop who lives in a dog eat dog world with few natural resources left and no understanding as to how the world used to be and eddie robinson as a man who remembers the past are both great .  br    br   their chemistry together is wonderful . the film also looks so much better in a great   mm print . fleisher really knows how to fill the screen  and the cinematoraphy  writing  music used  and everything about it works . the film is also very powerful in its bleak and very possible view of the future . just think how the world population grew  the rain forest that disappeared  resources used up  green house effect getting worse since     . i just wonder why this film has not played in theaters all these years . its reputation should be better .  br    br   speaking of reputations  often people speak as if charlton heston is not a great actor . seeing him in el  cid  soylent green  the warlord  the omega man  will penny  and major dundee back to back i am convinced he is one of our best actors . of course he made about a dozen other great films and for those that care you know what they are .  br    br    ,1
i bought this movie for   at a used cd store  and i kinda regret it . i  ll start by saying i  m a huge fan of cheesy horror flicks . they provide a horribly tacky cheap entertainment . this movie entertained for the first half hour  because it was so bad it could be made fun of in an mst  k style manner quite easily . then it got boring .  br    br   the acting is the scariest part of the movie . while great acting is not to be expected  this was laughably bad and  honestly  provided all of the entertainment that was to be had . this is the plus side to the movie . where the movie really falters in entertaining is the writing  lighting  and the editing .  br    br   this movie provides way too many  what the  is going on   moments . there are many moments  such as the mother having strange fits at dinner  and then that having absolutely no consequence in the movie . along the lines of dinner  someone in charge decided it was fun to watch people eat refined food for five minutes straight without dialogue every time a meal was served . during the meals and other inappropriate moments  the scene cuts away to pure darkness outside . then cuts back in . and speaking of darkness outside  one of the funniest parts of the movie is the climate  where apparently it isn  t nighttime unless it  s raining . and speaking of darkness  a big problem with the movie is that it  s so poorly lit you can  t see what  s going on half the time  which is more of a frustration than anything . in one of the climactic scenes  you can  t even tell what you  re supposed to be seeing that  s so shocking .  br    br   and when it comes to climactic scenes  unhinged contains one of the worst . i  ve seen people say  wow  that surprised me  and that  s good .  i can say that the big reveal did surprise me  because i didn  t see it coming . the reason i didn  t see it coming is because it made absolutely no sense . i won  t ruin it for you  but i will tell you that my friend and i spent a good twenty minutes rewinding to various parts of the movie to find anything that would have validated that at all  and all we found were more things saying that it wasn  t possible .  br    br   all in all  this movie is actually better when you watch it with the commentary tracks that make fun of it . i love crap horror movies  but this was too much .  ,0
elephant walk       starring an early peter finch as lord of the manor in some god  forsaken plantation where there is always the danger of elephants or mad englishmen  staying out in the midday sun and going berserk . well eventually they do  after the typhoid or cholera outbreak  of course  and much mayhem ensues . taylor replaced an ailing vivien leigh in this pot boiler  adventure flick . when the elephants storm the house and trap liz on the grand staircase i still get goose bumps . thank goodness dana andrews is around to save the day . one of my favorite guilty pleasures . in color too   ,1
i bought this dvd for   at walmart . after seeing it  i might just return to the store and try to get my money back  the only reason i gave the movie a  and not a  is that the story has a few novel story elements  though it really never rises to the level of being interesting . this film has all the earmarks of being a made for the drive  in theaters market   ultra  low budget  amateurish acting and a liberal dose of sex  for an early   s film  . in fact  i wonder if perhaps the only reason the film was made was to make a fast buck and because someone knew some strippers they could use as extras . the film is about a wacko doctor who wants to transplant his girlfriend  s severed head onto the body of an unsuspecting donor . most of the potential donors are skanky strippers or a model   whose only real purpose in the film is to titillate as they remove most of their clothes . however  they keep too much on to make the movie even worth watching for the naughty bits and the film isn  t quite awful enough to merit watching by bad film buffs .  ,0
  seed  is torture porn . . . no doubt about it . but  strangely  uwe boll has written  produced  and directed a more polished film than any other he has made in recent memory .  br    br   every time i watch a boll film  i feel that some pages of the script must have gone missing . there are simply huge gaps in the story and dialogue . of course  nothing makes much sense  either . the films are somewhat surreal in this respect .  br    br   spoilers  br    br   why do the six cops who go to arrest seed split up and go their separate ways when they get to the darkened residence  unlike real cops who would enter and clear the house in pairs or by threes  why don  t the cops ever use their radios  how can the bodies decay so quickly  a process that would normally take many months   i know it  s time  lapse photography . . . but seed would never be able to stay on schedule killing people if he always waited around for the previous victim to decay to the point shown .  how come seed gets to wear bib  overalls and a mask while he  s waiting on death row instead of typical prison uniforms  how can seed enter a maximum security prison  stroll around the cell block  and then walk out again without being stopped or even noticed  if nearly   people  according to some newspaper articles shown in the movie  have been murdered  why is there only one investigator working on the case  why did the investigator suddenly decide that he should go look for seed at seed  s house  where he was originally arrested and where he murdered his victims   didn  t he think of doing this sooner   why does the police detective go it solo  without back  up and without even letting dispatch know what he was doing and where he was headed   br    br   this is particularly frustrating when boll obviously goes far out of his way to make sure we understand why the electric chair fails to work properly . he spends several screen minutes in setting this up  when he could have spent them making other aspects of the film at least a bit more logical .  br    br   end spoilers  br    br   in short  the film just sort of serves as a framework for a few assorted scenes  perhaps boll would think of these as his  visions   of a brutal death by bludgeoning  gunshots to the head  execution by electrocution  and the skinning of live animals raised for their pelts .  the opening scenes of animals being skinned were indeed unnecessary and disturbing  but i understand their purpose in the context of the film .  the centerpiece is undoubtedly the bludgeoning death of a middle  aged woman by seed using a hatchet . it  s obvious that much time was spent on this and it vaguely reminds me of the classic scene in  reservoir dogs   though without the steely dan soundtrack .  br    br   is this a good movie  no . is it worth seeing  only if you are a dedicated fan of the torture porn genre or if you are absolutely determined to see a sample of torture porn . as i said at the start of this review  even though this movie is pretty disgusting and can be sickening at points  it is truly much more competent than most of boll  s movies . perhaps he will continue to improve as a filmmaker . i can only hope that he progresses beyond torture porn and continues more in the vein of  postal  .  ,0
this movie is complete crap  avoid this waste of celluloid at all costs  it is rambling and incoherent . i pride myself on plumbing the depths of    s sleaze cinema from everything from salo to salon kitty . i like being shocked  but i need a coherent story . however if watching horses mate gets you off this film is for you . the saddest part was that lame werewolf suit with the functional wang . i mean its just plain hard to sit through  not to mention the acting is terrible and the soundtrack is dubbed badly . please  i know the cover is interesting  what looks like a gorillas hands reaching for a woman  s bare ass  but don  t waste your time or money as you won  t get either back .  ,0
i  ve seen a lot of crap in my day  but goodness  hot rod takes the cake . i saw a free screening in ny the other night . i can only hope they show the funny version to the paying customers . the big laughs were sparse  the plot was uninteresting  and the characters were one dimensional at best . one highlight is a hilarious dancing scene with adam samberg . it was priceless and was the only scene i truly had a hearty laugh at . other than that  i can only recollect randomness and dead air . snl  samberg fans may be disappointed . i know i was expecting more from it . but it short  i definitely would not recommend attending a free screening or paying to watch this film .  ,0
i am at a distinct disadvantage here . i have not seen the first two movies in this series  although i have seen a lot of larry cohen films . fans of the series seem to think this is a good film . judging it on it  s own  it was pretty boring .  br    br   you never get a real good look at the maniac cop  s  robert z  dar  face  but what i did see was pretty grim . the death scenes seem to be staged to eat up the most film  not to give any thrills . maybe if i saw the nc    director  s cut  i may be more impressed .  br    br   the ending with the car chase with z  dar  caitlin dulany  and robert davi was pretty intense . best part of the movie .  ,0
amateur  no budget films can be surprisingly good . . . this however is not one of them .  br    br   ah  another brad sykes atrocity . the acting is hideous  except for emmy smith who shows some promise . the camera  direction  needs serious reworking . and no more  hold the camera and run  gimmicks either it just doesn  t work . the special effects are unimaginative  there  s a problem when the effect can be identified in real time . if you  re going to rip off an ear  please don  t let us see the actor  s real ear beneath the blood . the scenery is bland and boring  same as mr . sykes other ventures   and the music is a cross between cheap motel porn and really bad guitar driven metal  see the scenery comment  .  br    br   did i mention the lack of any real plot  or character development  apparently  the scriptwriter didn  t .  br    br   whoever is funding this guy . . . please stop . i  ve seen some of his other  home movies   which i will not plug  and they are just as bad . normally  a  director  will grow and learn from his previous efforts . . . not this guy . it  s one thing to be an amateur filmmaker  but anyone can be a hack .  br    br   definitely not even a popcorn film . . . of course  chewing on popcorn kernels would be less painful than this effort .  br    br   award the worst ever military push  ups in a film .  ,0
maybe  presque rien  is not the best movie ever made . . . but it is better than many of you have said . i still haven  t seen a homo  themed movie better than this one .  br    br   you americans are accustomed to watch very narrative movies  with a clear beginning  development and outcome . but european movies are less narrative  but makes you think much and feel .  br    br   many of you didn  t understand the sense of the movie . . the purpose of this one is not show us a simple  summer loving movie   with commercial characters who  fall in love and live happy forever  . summer holidays and beach are only a background  and this movie is directed to every young boy who may feel identified with those boys .  br    br   maybe some of you didn  t understand well this movie  because of its  parts  showed as flashbacks . these  moments are  summertime in pornichet  when they meet and love .  after a year and half living together in nantes  mathieu doesn  t go to a psychiatric himself . he tries to suicide taking something  and cedric brings him to hospital . later  he appears talking with a psychiatrist to find the reason about he done that .  the last part  is when mathieu come back to pornichet  in winter  alone . . to think about how his life have changed  how his life become to be  and trying to find himself .  br    br   it  s possible that some people couldn  t understand all this well  because all the scenes are mixed among them . but anyway  as i said before . . . this is not a funny movie . if what someone want to see is meat  for that  we have belami movies .  br    br   presque rien  what want to show us  is how cruel can be the life  for a young boy who is not sure about his feelings and not sure about what to do in life . mathieu only wants to go away from home  and try to live the kind of life that he thought could bring him the happiness . . but what seemed perfect at the beginning . . later is not as good as he thought  and he become troubled  and feel that he has lost the way of his life . he is lost and doesn  t know what he really wants to do  or what makes him happy . he finally become depressed and tries to commit suicide .  br    br   so  funny  is not a funny movie . very hot scenes  only a few . . but this is not a movie for entertainment . is all about feelings . . . friendship  love  happiness  unhappiness  pain  depression  loneliness . . . i  as many others  feel identified with life and problems of mathieu  and that is what director wanted to do . . a movie who show us the cruel reality of a boy  s life .  br    br   for me  the best homo  themed movie ever .  ,1
some films that you pick up for a pound turn out to be rather good    rd century films released dozens of obscure italian and american movie that were great  but although hardgore released some fulci films amongst others  the bulk of their output is crap like the zombie chronicles .  br    br   the only positive thing i can say about this film is that it  s nowhere near as annoying as the stink of flesh . other than that  its a very clumsy anthology film with the technical competence of a lego house built by a whelk .  br    br   it  s been noted elsewhere  but you really do have to worry about a film that inserts previews of the action into its credit sequence  so by the time it gets to the zombie attacks  you  ve seen it all already .  br    br   bad movie fans will have a ball watching the       continuity mistakes and the diabolical acting of the cast  especially the hitchhiker  who was so bad he did make me laugh a bit   and kudos to hardgore for getting in to the spirit of things by releasing a print so bad it felt like i was watching some beat up home video of a camping trip .  br    br   awful  awful stuff . we  ve all made stuff like this when we  ve gotten a hold of a camera  but common sense prevails and these films languish in our cupboards somewhere . avoid .  ,0
this is the greatest film i saw in      whereas i  m used to mainstream movies . it is rich and makes a beautiful artistic act from these   short films . from the technical info  the chosen directors   i feared it would have an anti  american basis  but . . . it  s a kind of    times  personal tribute .  br    br   the weakest point comes from y . chahine  he does not manage to  swallow his pride  and considers this event as a well  merited punishment . . . it is really the weakest part of the movie  but this testifies of a real freedom of speech for the whole piece . the weirdest comes from the mexican nearly conceptual  art film . . . i am still not sure what a . gonzalez inarritu meant . the  others are perfect  k . loach  s . penn  s . makhmalbaf  . . .  or nearly perfect  c . lelouch  and made me either smile  or cry or even left me stunned . i still don  t know if s . imamura  s fable is really related or not to the september   th catastrophe  but it is so pretty that its finale place deeply  makes it  .  ,1
while i am not a big fan of musicals  i have loved the films of fred astaire and ginger rogers because they are just so much fun . sure  they can be a bit formulaic  but even though you know what is going to happen  they still are very pleasing to watch . however  despite this  i was a bit disappointed in this outing . part of it was because this film doesn  t have the wonderful supporting cast like you saw in top hat or shall we dance . without edward everett horton or eric blore  the film seems to be a bit lacking   especially in the  fun  department . the silly antics of these supporting actors gave the other films charm that you just don  t get with follow the fleet . in addition  unlike the usual character played by astaire  this one is more of a jerk   as his fat head gets rogers into trouble again and again . and  as a result  it  s a lot harder to like him or want to see them get together in the end of the film . plus  although the music is by irving berlin  the songs just don  t seem as memorable . in fact  none of the songs were all that special and i can  t recall any of them even though i just saw the movie . while this is still a cute and worthwhile film  it just lacks the sparkle and magic of some of their other films . good but far from great .  ,1
i saw this movie when i was about   years  old and i liked it but it wasn  t until i watched it again at the age of   that i really understood it for what it is a cartoon about a criminal dog with a real heart of gold  adopts  a little girl in order to exploit her for her talents to talk to animals . the dog star  charlie b . barkin  is murdered by his formal business partner  carface   who is absolutely diabolical by the way  . his soul then goes to where else but heaven only to find a golden watch that is really his life  s time  which charlie  being the sneaky but lovable cad that he is steals and rewinds  sending him back to earth . once back on earth  charlie goes about seeking revenge on the evil carface . this is how he comes upon young anne  marie  the lonely little orphan that can talk to animals whom charlie plans to scam for her talents in order to get back at his enemy carface . but scoundrel charlie actually comes to care for young anne  marie and his plans unfoil as he must make up his mind to do what is right after anne  marie discovers what her  best friend  charlie has really been using her to make money for a new and better dog casino . now he must rescue her from the dreaded carface . i still love this movie even at the age of   . the idea and plot really are quite different and original from that of many other animated films . i especially like the idea that a dog plays the role of the villain for once . carface was even better than he was in the all dogs go to heaven sequel . in that picture he appeared quite dubious to his role of villain .  ,1
it was a decent movie  i actually kind of enjoyed it . but the ending is so abrupt   there is absolutely no closure and it leaves tons of loose ends . what happens after the concert  what happens with her boyfriend  does she hook up with grant  does she come beck in the next semester  and what about angela  obviously holly  s performance would knock angela down a few pegs  but nothing is shown to indicate how she reacts . there is so much left up in the air and it  s very unsatisfying . i don  t know if it is trying to leave room for a sequel or something  but it is a terrible ending and i think that it really makes the movie a joke . i was very disappointed .  ,0

i was not expecting much going in to this  but still came away disappointed . this was my least favorite halestorm production i have seen . i thought it was supposed to be a comedy  but i only snickered at  or  jokes . is it really a funny gag to see a fat guy eating donuts and falling down over and over  what was up with the janitor in heaven scene  fred willard has been hilarious with some of his christopher guest collaborations  but this did not work . they must have spent all the budget on getting  known  actors to appear in this because there was no lighting budget . it looked like it was filmed with a video camera and most scenes were very dark . does it really take that much film to show someone actually shoot and make a basket  as opposed to cutting away and editing a ball swishing through a basket  i try not to be too critical of low budget comedies  but if you want to see something funny go to a real church basketball game instead of this movie .  ,0

after becoming completely addicted to six feet under  i didn  t think there would ever be another show that would come close to being as good as this show . well  i was wrong  lost is spellbinding   i absolutely love this show and cannot turn it off . the richness of the characters  the intricacies of the plot  the beautiful setting are all amazing . i am totally and completely hooked . i don  t know how the creators do it  but each character touches me very deeply . i feel their joy  their pain  everything  right down to my core    i don  t have cable so i  ve been renting the series on netflix . when i put it on i watch all the episodes at once and feel sad when it is over . i can  t wait for the next disc to arrive at my house . this is probably the best tv show i have ever seen     ,1
very different topic treated in this film . a straightforward and simple description of local chinese customs  by looking at the daily operation of a public bath  run by the old owner and his retarded son  when older son returns home  wrongly believing his father has died . how every man in town makes his daily visit to chat  play games  discuss personal matters and get honest advice  besides the usual spa  like therapies . when old man dies  strong and loyal family ties make older son take charge  so public bath operation is not disrupted . and finally  the arrival of modernization to end this way of spending relaxed hours and getting along . the public bath has to be demolished  making place for a commercial complex to be constructed .  ,1
i really liked this movie . i have seen several gene kelly flicks and this is one of his best . i would actually put it above his more famous american in paris . sometimes it seems the story gets lost in gene kelly movies to the wonderful dance and song numbers  but not in this movie . it is definitely worth renting .  ,1
the filming crew did not have good access to the occupied territories  so filming of the israeli side dominated . i was struck by the nearly completely opposite points of view of the mothers . the israeli mother lost a child who had the possibility of a life of tremendous happiness . the palestinian mother lost a child who had only the possibility of a life of privation and despair . with such completely different viewpoints  any meeting had no real chance of any meeting of the minds . the word  peace  did not have the same meaning to each of them . peace to the palestinian was freedom . peace to the israeli was security . with such an abyss  is this sort of film really worth much  i finished with the feeling that i had watched pointless propaganda   both sides were unconvincing .  ,0
this movie set out to be better than the average action movie and in that regard they succeeded . this movie had spectacular cinematography featuring spectacular mountain snow and heights  a very fit stallone putting in a good performance as well  an exciting plot  and a great performance from it  s main villain becouse he will really shock you with his evil ways . the movie does not rank an all time great becouse of the weak screen play . the plot and story cries for this movie to make stallone an extra special human  much like the rambo or rocky or bond movie characters . they chose to humanise stallone  s character in this one which is ok but considering the plot  s style  weakens the excitement factor . also  the dialogue was cheesy and carelessly condescending at times . the script should have been more realistic and less  talky  . another weak point was the unrealistic shooting scenes . the movie makers should have been more carefull how they hadled the shooting hits and misses . they should have continued the quality of the scenes of the shooting sequences during the plane hijacking early in the movie . instead  they decided to water down a lot of the shooting sequences  ala  a  team  tv series  as soon as the villains set foot on the mountain tops . this movie had a lot of all time great potential . crisper action sequences  better dialogue and more rambo  rocky style emotion  determination from stallone would have taken this movie to a higher level . i know this was not stallone  s fault . i sense the movie  s director wanted to tone down stallone  s character and try to steal the movie by taking credit for his direction which was not all that great if not for his cinematographer . sill a good movie though . . . . . . . .  ,1
a movie made for contemporary audience . the masses get to see what they want to see . action  comedy  drama and of course sensuous scenes as well . this is not exactly a movie that one would feel comfortable watching with entire family . it isn  t for eyes of children . i had to fast forward quite a number of scenes .  br    br   if it is just entertainment you are looking for  then this movie has it all . the songs are catchy . a lavish production  i must add .  br    br   however  the message of the movie is not universal . it emphasizes on the idea of karma . that is  if you do good  you will get good . and if you do evil  you will get evil . the fruit of good deeds is good  while the fruit of evil is evil .  br    br   in real life  this is not always true . it is well  known that most people do not get justice in this world . while it is true that some evil people do meet with an evil end  there are many who escape . and then  there are many people who do good  and yet in return they meet with a sorry end .  br    br   if you don  t care about the message  and all you want is an escape from worldly reality  this movie is an entertainer alright .  ,1
a gave it a    instead of a     awful  because there is no denying that many of the visuals were stunning  a lot of talent went into the special effects and artwork . but that wasn  t enough to save it .  br    br   the  sepia  toned  washed out colors sort of thing has been done before many times in other movies . nothing new there . i can see there were some hat  tips to other old  classic movies . ok . no problem with that .  br    br   but a movie has got to be entertaining and interesting  not something that would put you to sleep .  br    br   the story line and the script of this movie was awful  the characters two dimensional . slow moving . some of the scenes were pretty to look at  but ultimately  as a whole  it was quite boring  i couldn  t recommend it .  ,0
this movie has it all  action  fighting  dancing  bull riding  music  pretty girls . this movie is an authenic look at middle america . believe me  i was there in     . lots of oil money  lots of women  and lots of honky tonks . too bad they are all gone now . the movie is essentially just another boy meets girl  boy loses girl  boy gets girl back  but it is redeemed by the actors and the music . there is absolutely no movie with any better music that this movie  and that includes american graffiti . it is a movie i watch over and over again and never get tired of it . every time i watch it  i am young again  and it is time to go out honky tonking . the only reason i only gave it a  is because you cannot rate a movie zero  i do not feel you should rate one   .  ,1
after watching this i thought to myself  there are either too few good writers  directors or lots of producers .  br    br   at any rate  this is a terrible movie . terrible in a way that it  s not fun  but rather makes you grit your teeth and quiver . makes you shout  this is wrong  at the movie . immersion is zero . by now most of you are probably used to the terrible errors  weirdness  es in movies that has computers hackers etc . in them . this movie is like that in every aspect .  br    br   the only good thing about the movie is the little girl emily  brilliantly played by eliza bennett . i hope she becomes big  and make this . . thing at least worth something .  br    br   do yourself a favor . don  t watch this . there is not even proper action in it . total waste of time .  ,0
as a mother of  young children who are or should i say have been growing up with the many reincarnations of scooby i feel well positioned to comment on the historical and current version of scooby .  br    br   if as a family we had not seen any episodes prior to shaggy and scooby get a clue we may have enjoyed it as a light weight  nothing special saturday morning cartoon . but that in essence is the problem it is in it  s current format so light weight that it will not have the longevity of the  old  scooby and gang . i  m sure it may succeed in a quick monetary return but i  m sure the long term buy in of old and young is in very real danger of being lost . my  year old son on seeing the new version was really disgruntled and without any prompting said that it looked really badly animated and why wasn  t it anything like the last series  where are you  .  br    br   scrappy doo was an anomaly but still infinitely better than this . let  s hope get a clue will be apropos with reference to the producers .  ,0
from a poorly contrived plot line that makes almost no sense to bad dialogue and disjointed scenes to the ultimate downer  bad acting  even peter falk can  t find his way   finding john christmas  is better left lost . ms . bertinelli  s performance is without depth or emotion as are her co  stars  william russ as brother hank and david cubitt as love interest noah . jennifer pisana as soccoro  the daughter of single dad noah is almost unbearable to watch let alone listen to singing . but who can blame them with material like this . michael j . murray  s script is juvenile at best .  br    br   each year at this time i search the tv guides and wait anxiously for some of the really classic christmas and inspirational holiday films to appear on the small screen . films like  miracle on   th street   ernst lubitsch  s delightful  the shop around the corner  and  of course the     version of  scrooge  . there  s frank capra  s classics  it  s a wonderful life  and  meet john doe  . hey  forget the classics . what about  home alone  or  home for the holidays  with holly hunter and a great performance by robert downey jr .   br    br   my present to you is by way of advice . your time would be better spent searching out these films than finding  finding john christmas  . merry christmas   ,0
to be honest  i didn  t watch all of the original  howling   but those scenes i saw made it obvious that the first howling was a great movie . so great  that seven horrible sequels had to be made . they started off with  howling ii your sister is a werewolf  . i got this movie on vhs from my uncle sometime ago when he was giving away a bunch of old movies he bought back when atari was brand new . i just watched it last night  and it wasn  t really bad  it was just weird . i mean  the whole thing with sybil danning going three  way with two of her werewolf minions was just out of place and quite disturbing  but kinda hot   christopher lee about to stab a dead karen as if she  s a vampire  etc . actually  this movie was actually like some sort of mish  mash of dracula and the lost boys . . . except with werewolves  because everything christopher lee  whom played dracula himself  was saying about werewolves pretty much ripped off from every other vampire movie  stake in the heart  garlic  the creature of the night must die at night  and the ruler of werewolves lives in transylvania  . not much for the acting  but the worst of it came from annie mcenroe . i swear  at some point in the film i found myself rooting for the werewolves to rip her throat out  because that damn throat always had to say something . anyway  the plot is pretty silly and clichd  so there  s no real point in telling you  you could just read about it on wikipedia . by the way  the thing that really makes me nauseous about this movie is the fact that it  s the only film out of all the seven sequels thats related in any way to the original  not counting howling iv        which was a remake of the original  or in other words  a sequel based on the same novel  . so don  t see this movie . there  s no real horror  hardly any werewolves  and just horrible special fx .      ,0

undying is a very good game which brings some new elements on the tired genre of first person shoot em ups . it tells the story of patrick galloway an expert of the occult and a formidable fighter who is summoned by a friend to his estate in ireland to investigate some weird phainomena . the game is set in ireland after world war one so don  t expect to find weapons like chainguns or rocket launchers . all the weapons in the game can be considered antiques but the real fun in the game are its spells and the system they operate on . our hero is ambidexterous so he can use both his hands at the same time he casts spells with his right arm and uses his guns with the left . so you can shoot and cast spells at the same time which as you understand very fun and also unique to this game  the graphics are great and they can run very well on a medium power p . c . . level design is also cool and atmospheric . mostly the game revolves around the covenant estate and the mansion but there are many other locations waiting to be discovered as you progress . thanks to the talent of clyve barker the game has an excelent storyline and plot  something very rare for a first person shooter  and i said before a great and very spooky atmosphere the voice acting is also good but not excellent . but the game has two main flaws . first of all it is quite linear so when your mission says for example go to that room all the doors in the house will be locked apart from those that lead to the room of your mission this may save time but it restricts your liberty of exploration . secondly the fact all the weapons are antiques may not appeal to most fps players who are used to high tech weaponry . as far as difficulty is concerned the game is very well balanced . most of it is of medium difficulty but sometimes it gets more difficult but not frustratingly difficult . overall undying is a great game . definitely one of the best fps out there .  ,1

as a kid i thought this movie was great . it had animals  it had beautiful music  and it had my favorite actor michael j . fox . now  i still love this movie  for different reasons . it has well trained animals that are put through various stunts and scenes that look excellent on camera . it has beautiful  well  written musical that fits the scenes perfectly  with rousing fast  paced melodies and the heart wrenching main theme  that still makes me cry . even when people hum it . and it has my favorite actor  michael j . fox .  br    br   based on a book  this is the story of three house pets  an intelligent  overly  trusting and considerably paternal lab by the name of shadow  a witty and vain  but still smart  cat with a fear of water named sassy and a street  smart ridiculously curious and slightly neurotic bulldog  chance . the three are taken to a friend  s farm when their family goes away . dismayed and worried  the pets break out and plan a trip across the sierra mountains for the trip of their lives . a truly incredible journey . so what  maybe home is just over that mountain . but what if it isn  t   br    br   i suggest homeward bound for people that like the three amazing actors providing the voices for the lead animal characters  and for anyone else that . . . yeah  everyone go watch it .  ,1
cedric kahn  s films have been character  based  rather than action  based  i  m thinking of l  ennui and feux rouges  so it is jarring to see this series of really expert car chases interspersed with some plodding attempts to give character to succo . i don  t find stefano cassetti to be an interesting actor he reminds me of pro athletes who are coaxed into movies  like bret favre . that blank stare looks like a really vicious deer caught in the headlights . a real actor would have forced us to reflect more on succo  s personality  rather than admiring his skill at carjacking .  br    br   the little acting there is comes mainly from isild le besco as the needy schoolgirl succo takes by storm . the interview at the police office is a marvel of bland obstinacy with a little fear of the future blended in . le besco apart  there is little to recommend this film .  ,0
it figures this is a french film  lol  with the emphasis on young girls with much older men . . . why is it the french are so fixated on this kind of thing  when the age difference is this great  it really comes off as pervy  valentina cervi is beautiful  she bears a strong resemblance to olivia hussey  of zeffirelli  s    romeo and juliet  set in a similar period   but she looks about   and the actor playing tassi  her painting instructor  looks . . . well    is kind .  br    br   other posters have done the work of explaining the historical record  unusually detailed in this case  of the real artemisia  a great artist and one of the earliest recognized female painters of this period    th century  . her story speaks to us in modern times particularly because of the age  old accusation that  all great artists were men    she pretty much blasts that assertion to bits   and because the story of her rape trial is so poignant . not only was she clearly assaulted  and forced into a degrading sexual relationship  because in those days marriage to your assaulter was the only way to avoid social shame   but tassi was a serial rapist and possibly killed his wife and child .  br    br   the movie does a terrible disservice by inverting this truly fascinating and remarkable real life story   very dramatic and not in need of any  spicing up    because in some weird frencified way  it  s  hotter  to have an oversexed teenager drawing male sexual organs and having a hot love affair with a man old enough to be her grandfather . that  s  sexy    the truth is boring and seems too feminist  politically correct .  br    br   it also disturbs me that this is only part of artemisia life considered interesting enough to film . the fact that she painted for decades  her famous painting of judith beheading holfernes was painted after  not before the rape   that she was the first woman admitted to the prestigious florentine academy  that she went on to have children . . . oh that  s boring stuff . after all  that  s about a middle aged woman and they aren  t  hot  like teenagers .  br    br   i understand that there is a lot of creative license in making a film  or a book  about a real historical character . you need to create dialog  have subplots  create dramatic structure . certainly some details can be sacrificed   it  s no big deal if the dates are moved a few years  or if artemisia is played by a blonde actress  when we know from her self portraits that she was a brunette . . . and a big boned one  not a skinny minny   or something like that . but to turn her story around on her  and make rape into a romance is actually sick and disturbing . it  s even worse because the director is female . she should be horribly ashamed of herself   br    br   if you like this  and i know some people could care less about the real woman artist and just like period costumes and hot sex   you will probably like  dangerous beauty  with rufus sewell and catherine mccormack . similarly based on heavily re  written history  with lots of heaving bosoms and jewel encrusted goblets bon appetit   ,0
probable reasons why so many people on this site have enjoyed this  br    br    . they might not have read the book .  . they might enjoy gore and violence in a film .  . they might be very young and therefore not understand the violence .  . people might not understand how somehow more scary and more violent it is compared to the original book .  . there are sure to be many other reasons not covered here .  br    br   the only thing i liked about this film is the song   bright eyes  .  br    br   if perchance  you happen to be one of those people who has read the book  enjoys calm and peaceful films without violence and are quite old and understand scariness and violence  you are sure not to like this . otherwise you will almost definitely enjoy this .  br    br   like in the book  a rabbit called fiver in an unsuspecting warren warns of terrible danger to come . only a few rabbits  including his brother hazel  believe him and they set out on a dangerous journey to find a new place to live . . .  ,0
this is an entertaining look at the gospel as presented by johnny cash  adorned in black  of course  who sings a lot and narrates a bit also . if you like johnny cash  this film is quite enjoyable . also note the blonde depiction of jesus in this work . . . just for fun  try to think of five jewish men who have blonde hair . . .  anyway  its a fun presentation of the greatest and most important story of all .  ,1
this movie was so unrelentingly bad  i could hardly believe i was watching it . the directing  editing  production  and script all seemed as though they had been done by junior high school students who don  t know all that much about movies . there was no narrative flow that made any sort of sense . big emotional moments and climaxes  like one early on between heath ledger and naomi watts  and character relationships  like one hinted at at the very beginning  come completely out of no where and are not set up like they would have been in a more elegantly and effectively made film . the characters are sadly underdeveloped  making it difficult for us to have any sort of connection with them . the acting  surprisingly  is not entirely bad  but the terrible writing cancels out the relatively convincing performances . the film plays like a particularly bad t . v . western  epic  and sadly diminishes the fascinating  true  story that it attempts to tell . i have read a lot of reviews that defend the film as being important to australians because of the subject matter . that  s all very well  but just because ned kelly is an important australian historical icon doesn  t make the movie good . no one is saying that the subject matter isn  t good  just the quality of the movie itself . pearl harbor was about a very important historical event to americans  but that doesn  t mean i  m going to defend the movie and say it was good  because it was still bad . a failure all around  though heath and orlando are lovely to look at .  ,0
the first episode of this new show was on today  and it was horrible . not only did shaggy have a squeaky new voice that made listening to his lines torture  but it  s so far away from the original concept and animation style that it  s barely recognizable as a  scooby  doo  show .  br    br   even back in the dark days when fred and velma were gone and scooby  s nephew scrappy was there  the team still solved mysteries . this new show instead features shaggy and scooby battling a james bond type super  villain and his henchmen while living in a mansion . there  s not even a van called  the mystery machine   and the teaser for the next episode which promised a transformers type robot car did not put my mind at ease  . how can anyone take scooby doo and make this   br    br   the show earns two point for two scenes featuring the whole scooby doo gang  all of whom speak with the correct voices except shaggy  and even then i  m being far too generous .  ,0
  the notorious bettie page         br    br   directed by mary harron  br    br   starring gretchen mol  chris bauer  lili taylor  sarah paulson   david strathairn  br    br   mpaa rating  r   for nudity  sexual content and some language   br    br   it seems as though every celebrity nowadays is getting a biopic made about his or her life . from ray charles to johnny cash  biopics are very posh right now .  the notorious bettie page  is the latest of these to be released on dvd . it features gretchen mol as the world  s most famous pin  up model  bettie page and was filmed mostly in black and white with certain excerpts in color . unlike  ray    walk the line   and  finding neverland   however  this movie is not going to be one to watch out for at the oscars this year . this movie lacks the emotional resonance displayed in other biopics and most of the more dramatic moments in bettie page  s life are either completely ignored or only merely suggested . this does not mean  however  that it is a bad movie . in fact   the notorious bettie page  is a thoroughly entertaining and fulfilling movie   a solid work of cinema . this film focuses more on page  s exciting career and the thin line between sexuality and pornography . it is filmed with fervor and care and mary harron  s direction captures the look and feel of the time period as most filmmakers only dream about .  br    br   everyone knows bettie page  played by mol  . whether you know her as an iconor a simple porn staryou know her . she is a woman who had a very profound impact on american culture only by revealing more skin than deemed appropriate at that particular time . now  most people know her as one of america  s first sex symbols   a legend to many models  especially those of playboy and other adult  oriented magazines . she lived in a time when showing just an inch of flesh below the waste could have someone arrested and page  s bondage  style photos were just the thing to push the american public into an uproar . in fact  the photos launched a full  fledged senate investigation about common decency and the difference between harmless films and porn .  br    br   the performances in  the notorious bettie page  are absolutely wonderful with gretchen mol standing out . her performance as bettie page is simply brilliant . i understand that  when she was announced for the role  many people were skeptical . her name is not one that immediately leaps to my mind when i think of great performances . now  it will . she completely aced the role and drew me in with her vulnerable and yet deeply engaging performance . david strathairn is fresh off of last year  s  good night  and good luck   in which he gave one of      s best performances . here  he gives yet another fine performanceeven though he is slightly underused . i was shocked at how very limited his screen time wasbut quality over quantity is always the most important aspect of any good movie . the only performance i have seen from lili taylor was that in  the haunting        . while most people ignored the movie  i found it to be an enjoyable  if not completely shallow  horror movie and i also have always thought that taylor was perfectly credible as the emotionally  distraught nell . here  taylor gives yet another credible performance . she gives a very subdued performance and delivers the perfect performance to compliment that of gretchen mol .  br    br   after everything was said and done  i realized that  the notorious bettie page  cannot be compared to other biopics  such as  finding neverland  and  walk the line  . it is incomparable to these because it tells a story of a woman and her career  from the beginning to the end . her personal life is briefly implied  but it is really her impact on the world that becomes the high point . we watch the film knowing that page will eventually bare all and we know the impact that her decisions will havebut we are rarely shown the impact that they will have on her personal life . she is a woman that never looked back and could constantly reinvent herself . after all  she was an adult model turned christian missionary . this movie does not over dramatize anything . it could have included fictitious moments of page sobbing hysterically and begging god to forgive her . it could have shown page running and screaming through the rain  trying to escape the ghosts of her pastand yet it does not .  the notorious bettie page  tells a simple story and that is something rare by today  s standards . fortunately  it is quite refreshing .  br    br   final thought  the notorious bettie page  is a relaxing movie with absolutely amazing cinematography .  br    br   overall rating      a   ,1
spoilers  in as far as i describe characters and their relation to the plot .  br    br   this is a quality film . the subject matter is at once grim and gripping . the dogged determination of stephen rea  s character  burakov  is simply captivating . with any due apologies to him  his hangdog  continually put  upon expression serves the character well . he is  as we in england would say of the inspector taggart tv series character  bound to be grim because he sees three murders a week . well  that  s not strictly accurate as chikatila operated over a number of years . . .  br    br   you get a real sense of the blankwall resistance of the ussr bureaucracy  brilliantly portrayed by joss ackland  who often seems made for this sort of role  .  br    br   a key character  and i write this as the remake of invasion of the body snatchers is being shown on bbc   is the donald sutherland character  mikhail fetisov  . his quiet support of burakov is steadfast . and it endures through perestroika  and drives the involvement of the fbi for profiling . brilliant .  br    br   this is a must  see  as far as i am concerned .  ,1
this movie is the best film ever . i can  t remember the last time a movie has drawn tears out of me . with a tear in my eye  i admire this movie . it has all the elements that a good movie must have excellent dialogues  music  acting  story  plot . a story of friendship  courage  kindliness and loyalty between a street performing who famous to the king of masks and a little girl that sold as a boy in serf bazaar . little girl liked to be his granddaughter and king of masks liked a grandson . they were not conventional in real . every scene they were together was priceless . the camera work is flawless and grips you . the acting is inspired . xu zhu was excellent as the king of masks . renying zhou  doggie  looks pretty and played her character very well . zhigang zhao as liang sao lang was great . he played his helpful and kindhearted character extremely well . if you have  t this movie  try it once  do watch it .  ,1
kalifornia is a movie about lost ideals . a journey on the darkest road ever . the road of no return . the plot is about a couple that set out to find a better life in california . the man  david duchovny in his best role up to now  wants to write a book about the famous crimes that have happened in america and his girl  who is a photographer  is going to take the pictures . so they set out on a trail of famous murders not knowing what awaits them on the way . to share the journey expenses they decide to find another couple and they put an ad . but the couple that answers it is not just any couple . it is one of the strangest couples ever . the girl is a naive  frail creature that dreams a lot and loves cactuses . the man is exactly the opposite . a cruel ruthless murderer . we learn that early in the film and we follow him along the journey to kalifornia  not with c as usual  but with k  presumably symbolizing the word killer   along his journey of betrayal  murder and finally defeat . all the leads  duchovny  pitt  lewis and forbes give really good performances and you have to take into consideration that when this movie was filmed not even one of them was a star . the photography is amazing  with darkness covering the greatest parts of the movie  and the music suits the dark character of the film . on the whole this is a really good movie . don  t miss it . you  ll think again before taking some stranger in your car to share the gas with   ,1
this movie was the best movie i have ever seen . being lds i highly recommend this movie because you are able to feel a more understanding about the life of joseph smith . although the movie was not made with highly acclaimed actors it is a remarkable and life changing movie that can be enjoyed and appreciated by everyone . i saw this movie with my family and i can bear witness that we have all had a change of heart . this movie allows people to really understand how hard the life was for the prophet and how much tribulation he was faced with . after i saw this movie  there was not a single dry eye in the entire room . everyone was touched by what they saw and i have not been the same since i have seen it . i highly recommend this movie for everyone .  ,1
don  t really know where to start with one of the worst films i have had the displeasure to watch in a very long time . from the setting which was quite obviously and very clear to anyone who has visited london for even  day will agree . . . was not london . to the much unexplained way how snipe  s character managed to escape the country back to the us without a single problem . then he convinces the girl and grandmother to visit him in america  how on earth did grandma agree to that . . . he  s an assassin  well that  s the ending how about during the film  well unfortunately that didn  t fare much better . we have british cops driving an amazing range of cars  i  m sure it was an eighties vauxhall belmont which chased the taxi after the assignation  but a modern subaru imprezza escorting the prison van in a few scenes prior . so   or whoever the gun toting arm of the met they were trying to portray was happily running around the streets with their guns out chasing after snipe  s along with the cia . there were children walking around  but the police were still stating they had a clear shot to shoot him  does this happen in london  no it doesn  t  i live there . we also have the very implausible travel from central london to the airport  let  s say heathrow for arguments sake  within  minutes of receiving a call . we also have terrible american accents  a young girl who  s posher than the queen  but lives in elephant  castle . what does it say for british police when helicopters and a number of officers at snipe  s location can  t find snipe  s and he manages to evade capture by hiding behind some stairs  the train station was obviously not even on uk soil and the fight scene sound effects were terrible . the plot was also extremely poor  boring and been written and filmed a lot better a thousand times before . but there were a few notable actors cast in this film  what were they thinking and please don  t let that sway you to watch this film  this film didn  t seem to know what it wanted to be  if you are going to concentrate on the dramatic aspects from the aftermath of an assignation then you need a strong rigid plot with plausible scenery and setting  this is something the viewer has time to take in and appreciate and if you do it wrong then you notice it . if you want an all out action film  which this is not  then continuity and scenery can be put to the side .  ,0
i barely remember this show  a little  but i remembered it was great  my eldest brother  reminded me about the show recently and i had seen an advertisement for the d . v . d set coming out . the network  again screwed up in pulling this from the air  so that they could put what else in it  s place  it should have gone at least  seasons . why not  right  i think sometimes that the network executives think they are the  gods  of the entertainment world . but they mis  guess and flat out miss good show placement from time to time . let it be said that  they have a lot more flops than  hits  . this was one of the poor decisions to cut from the line  up . anyhow  i am getting this for my collection .  ,1
this show is awful . no comedy  no plot no good characters . america are you blind give the award to real shows . i hate this show along with   rock . honestly i  m so glad they canceled this show . thank you cbs . keep two and a half men  keep christine  keep rules of engagement keep how i meet your mother which really isn  t funny but a lot funnier than this . this show is a rip off of friends . with the same director so thats okay . but keep this show gone and never bring it back . never ever ever ever . the only reason i didn  t give it a  rating is because it keep my awake instead of asleep . those are the types of movies or tv shows that i give a one . the only reason i was still awake was because of the audiences laughter and i was looking forward to the next show . i really wish this show was funny sorry but my opinion stupid . very stupid . i don  t see why everyone loves it . my opinion again . but i also find big bang theory kinda stupid . my bad smart . the class bye bye now i have a smile and it is not from watching your show .  ,0
ok the plot is  wait you got me there is no true discernible plot here just a string of optically fogged sex scenes  strung together by scenes of photographers taking pictures of pretty ladies  sometimes a combination of the two  then a demon comes around kills the men  rapes and kills the women  and waxes poetic about the meaning of life . moronic special effects  bad acting and bizarre philosophy aside  you get what you expect from a film with a title like this . i guess it would have to be someone  s cup of tea  just not mine as i have yet to see a good kazuo  gaira  komizu directed film .  br    br   dvd extras subtitled interview with director kazuo komizu part   part  is on the entrails of a beautiful woman dvd   and theatrical tailer  br    br   my grade f  ,0
the subject notwithstanding  this is an amateur  exhibitionist movie   or an effort at one   which is about as interesting and daring as a moody high school student  s composition book full of death  poetry  . to be sure  it will disturb viewers who are hell  bent on being disturbed  but the success will be attributable to themselves  not to the director . to genuinely get under somebody  s skin requires sensibility  discipline  technique  and talent  as well as an eye and an ear . the film does contain one evocative image  shown as a still  and also used on the video case   but with no development leading up to or away from it . if the director had had an eye  he would have seen it as a possible starting point for an interesting movie   that is  a movie .  ,0

a great ensemble cast  a fond remembrance of younger carefree days . this movie takes me back to when i went to summer camp . indian summer  while full of practical jokes and pranks  is about growing up and coming to terms with life with middle  age life . my family  i thoroughly enjoyed this movie .  ,1
well the reason for seeing it in the cinema was that it was a sneak preview  else i would never have seen this terrible teenage slasher movie . i mean haven  t we had enough of this yet  scream and scary movie at least did not take them self serious  the plot sucks  and the acting is the worst i  ve seen .  only godzilla can compare  which is also the only movie that competes in being the worst i  ve seen in the cinema with this one .   br    br   there is so many plot holes in the story  and the girls are so alike  that you don  t even now who has been killed  and who has not .  and you don  t care .  the only of them i knew in advance was denise  and she was the most talent less actress i have ever seen in this bad excuse for a movie .  br    br   stay as far away from this movie as possible .        ,0
prussic gas  a murderer donning a red clansman suit and hood wielding a white whip  and the murders of college school girls at the hands of paid convicts enlisted by a mysterious mastermind who keeps his face hidden within an office containing aquariums of turtles and fish . the inspectors at scotland yard  higgins  ijoachim fuchsberger  and his superior sir john  siegfried schrenberg  certainly have their hands full with this case . it all seems to center around student ann portland  uschi glas   who  when she turns    is to inherit a great deal of wealth . the girls who are targeted share a room with ann  but the reason for their murders remains a mystery sy  s finest must figure out . the staff of the girls  dormitory all seem to be hiding something and certain members of the faculty are falling prey to the killer in the red monk robe disguise  talented enough to precisely strangle the necks of those attacked with the whip . two prisoners are commissioned by a mystery man to use the newly created toxic gas created by a scientist murdered at the beginning of the film during what was supposed to be a monetary exchange for his creation . it  s a clever scheme where a driver  greaves  gnter meisner  meets the convicts  . . who hide in a barrel  who are assisted by a corrupt prison guard . taken blindfolded to the secret room of the mastermind  he gives them orders on who to kill and how . uncovering this operation is a top priority for higgins and sir john for it will lead them to the truth they seek in regards to the murders and why they are happening . under suspicion are girls  dormitory headmistress  her author brother  a sweaty  incredibly nervous chemistry teacher  a snooping gardener  and the bannister . some are red herrings until they are disposed of  throwing the viewer for a loop each time until the real mastermind is discovered . the ending features multiple twists .  br    br   out of the krimi films i  ve seen  the college girl murders is the closest to a giallo with it  s colorful killer  a convoluted plot yielding lots of surprises and potential suspects   sordid shenanigans between adults and the college girls at the dormitory . i think you can also see the influence of james bond on this particular krimi film with the villain mastermind  s secret hideout with an alligator pit  . . which isn  t used   the fake bible  water pistol  when opened  fires the gas into the face of startled victims  the greaves  royles royce which has latches that cause flaps to darken the windows without revealing the passenger in the back seat  and the peep holes used to spy on the girls in their rooms and while swimming . many might consider sir john a liability due to his bumbling  buffoonish behavior and how he often undermines higgins  abilities to get at the truth  . . perhaps poking fun at know  it  all british inspectors who harm a case more than solve it  . . i felt he was used as comedy relief  particularly with his attempts at psychoanalyzing suspects and potential victims  often misunderstanding what are told to him . higgins  using the skills adopted over his years as an investigator  instead follows the clues  facts  often avoiding sir john as much as possible . capable direction by the reliable alfred vohrer who keeps the pace humming at a nice speed  and the screenplay is full of interesting characters and lurid content . . the fact that so many of the adults surrounding the dormitory are suspect  any of them might be the one wielding the whip or calling the shots behind those murdered girls  executions . i  d say this may be one of the best  . . if not the best  examples of the krimi genre  for it keeps you guessing  always one more ace up it  s sleeve . . the revelations unearthed at the very end are quite eye  opening  . . and  you even get a literal unmasking of the real mastermind pulling the strings to top it all off  .  ,1

this sounded like a really interesting movie from the blurb . nazis  occult  government conspiracies . i was expecting a low budget nazi version of the davinci code or the boys from brazil or even shockwaves . instead you get something quite different  more psychological  more something like from david lynch . that was actually a plus . but the way the story is told is just awful .  br    br   part of the trouble is the casting . andrienne barbeau  s character starts off the moving being somewhat timid and afraid . she just doesn  t do that well  even at her age  though she certainly tried . the actor cast as the son apparently thought this was a comedy . most of the other actors also seemed to have thought this was a campy movie  or at least acted like it  rather than simply being quirky . the only one that i thought did really well was the daughter  siri baruc .  br    br   another big part is the pacing . it starts off very slowly . so slowly you might be tempted to turn it off . but then it gets compelling for a while when you get to the daughter  s suicide and the aftermath . but shortly afterward  it all becomes a jumbled mess . some of this was on purpose  but much of it was just needlessly confusing  monotonous  and poorly focused .  br    br   the real problem  is it  s simply not a pleasant movie to watch . it  s slow  dull  none of the characters are likable . overuse of imagery and sets . some movies you see characters get tortured . in this  it  s the viewer that does . it does have a few creepy moments  most notably the creepy nazi paintings and the credits  but the rest of the movie is mostly just tiresome .  ,0
despite the rave reviews this flick has garnered in new zealand  any hype surrounding the production is sadly undeserved . apart from a clichs  only plot  the movie is let down by some weak acting  accents  and overall lack of tension .  br    br   whilst having the overall look of a big budget  for nz   the feel is decidedly small  town kiwi . . .  br    br   has anyone not seen the brothers    http   imdb . com  title  tt          those who have will pick the similarities straightaway . . . . i  ve heard comments that scenes like the boys playing basketball etc were shot to poke fun at the clichd  boys talking crap   but it comes across as forced . . .  br    br   i believe oscar keightley sees himself as deeply ironic  but again his delivery always seems merely vaguely self conscious .  br    br   those who have any doubts left at all that samoans  living  in  nz culture has been deeply  hopefully not permanently  affected by american speech  culture  and everything inbetween will certainly have their minds made up at the end of this movie .  br    br   robbie magasiva always looks good on screen  but is let down by the script . .  br    br   it always rubs me up the wrong way when a  comedy  has scenes that are set up in such an obvious way  you are left feeling like having a good groan at the clichd punchline  see the wanna be white boy . . .  br    br   i know someone who found this movie hilarious  however  that person has the brains of a tadpole  and would struggle to spell her name if offered a million dollars . . . .  br    br   that kinda sums up the mentality of this flick  ok but not great  fun but not funny . . . . . wake up nz  this is not a  star movie despite all the glowing  middle class white guilt       reviews . . . .  br    br   my advice  if you watch it  get drunk first     ,0
the events of september       do not need extra human interest in the shape of following the training of the rookie fireman or the progress of the two french brothers . in my view it would have been better to leave this out . i think the directors tried too hard  perhaps they felt that the events of the day needed a story as a backdrop . the comment of one of a policemen   this aint fing disneyworld  is apt .  br    br   nevertheless it is compelling viewing for the depiction of the events . the filmakers were in all the right places at the right times  no other footage from the day matches what they shot .  ,1
this film is a bit reminiscent of the german film  the neverending story because a child is magically transported to a strange land in order to be a hero . however  due to far superior modern technology  puppets and cgi are used to make an amazingly realistic looking world   one that will blow your socks off due to its realism and scope .  br    br   i enjoyed this film  but boy was it a chore at first  unfortunately  for most westerners  this film is one you might give up on very quickly or dismiss it since everything in the film seems so odd . however  give it a chance . don  t think or try to understand everything you see   just allow the story to unfold and you will most likely enjoy the film .  br    br   in many ways  this is exactly the sort of advice i  d give to adults who watch miyazaki  s spirited away because it is very similar and features tons of yokai  japanese mythical spirits  . the big differences between the two is that the great yokai war is live  action and spirited away is much more child  friendly . while i do think the great yokai war was intended mostly as a kids  movie  in the usa  most parents would not want to show this to younger kids because it  s so violent  scary and features some adult behaviors . so who is the audience in the west  well  older kids and adults who appreciate foreign films with non  western themes and composition . this is a rather narrow audience  indeed   br    br   while you are watching  look for all the strange little touches . in fact  you could watch the film dozens of times and notice different tiny things each time . a few of the funny references i liked were the comment about gamera  the scene that came with the comment  kids don  t try this at home  as well as the use of kirin beer to allow a person to actually see the yokai  hmm  . . . perhaps that scene should have also contained this warning    br    br   by the way  director takashi miike is a hard one to pin down stylistically  other than to say that none of his stories i  ve seen have seemed  normal  . some of his films are rather disgusting and disturbing and i hated them  especially audition and ichi the killer  whereas some of them are magical and among the best films i  ve ever seen  the happiness of the katakuris  . one thing for sure  it  s hard to watch one of his films and not have a strong reaction one way or the other .  ,1
the    s is a great movie  i saw it completely in one night  about the hippy movement in the late    s . although the title would suggest otherwise the first  years of the    s are not really important in this film .  br    br   the main character of the movie is michael  a political activist who goes on the road in the us against the vietnam  war . there he meets his girlfriend  sarah . michael  s brother  brian  goes to vietnam to fight  what a surprise   . he comes back from the war and changes in a  tom cruise born on the fourth of july  look a like and then into a hippy . his dad is a pro  vietnam war type of guy  what a surprise    . michael  s sister kate gets pregnant from a rock  roll artist and runs away from home and goes to san francisco during the summer of love . the ending is very poor  father becomes a liberal and everybody is happy   but i let this slip away from my vote  the rest of the movie is very good   .  br    br   the performances by the actors are pretty good and the soundtrack of the movie is absolutely brilliant . all the main events of the sixties are in the movie  like the murders on jfk and martin luther king aswell as the big hippy protests  the summer of love and woodstock  look closely for wavy  woodstock speaker  gravy  what we have in mind is breakfast in bed for    .      as a first aid employee at the woodstock festival   br    br   in the end  the    s is a beautiful movie about a beautiful decade        ,1
i love this movie . it  s wacky  funny  violent  surreal  played out in a madman  s head  and definitely not your usual comedy .  br    br   if you don  t find the film amusing then i guess it  s just not for your tastes  so this is a tough one to write a review for .  br    br   for reference  some other comedies i love are the big lebowski  the princess bride  and zoolander  that one only got me the second time around  . there are others  but my taste is definitely for the unusual  and i am willing to accept that most people just don  t tend to like that kind of thing . i make no apologies for having an unusual sense of humour  at least i have one .  br    br   the scenes and characters of this particular movie are well put together  the verbal humour is hilarious  the situations are intriguing  the acting is very good  as you would expect of the cast   though the acting demands made of the cast by the script are not particularly high . the overall package makes for fun  funny  watchable yet violent entertainment .  ,1
dil was a memorable movie that bring to the celluloid a great director like indra kumar . the movie followed with beta  ishq  raja  masti all of whom were superb .  br    br   but then every successful director gives a few horrible movies alongwith some hits too . pyare mohan is one such movie .  br    br   though the comedies are told nicely but then they fail the viewer to laugh . comparing with the kind of comedy movies being made today this is a dumb .  br    br   if you really want to watch a movie and laugh  please don  t watch this . because the pathetic comedy will make you cry only .  br    br   in short  the movie is worth a miss .  ,0
tom had a wish to make film for a long time and he did . it is as if he has visualized a dirty and worn out notebook full of great little ideas he has been filling up and carrying around for   years . no grant character transformations  no hollywood ingredients just life and a little bit of magic . the balance  in speed  in weirdness in comedy vs drama is perfectly weighed . this film takes you on a journey that is over before you realize how nice it was . the music is great and your eyes will be equally satisfied . the fact that this film is about nothing  merely a sequence of sketches of people that are mainly linked trough a party of one of the characters  makes it very pleasant and surprisingly entertaining  it is brilliant because it is empty . in between the lines it is happening . to see or not to see  that  s the   ,1
i don  t like sean penn  s directing very much  and this early work  the indian runner  is no exception . the movie has no core  it  s colored with a kind of redneck  anti  authoritarian tweeness that in all honesty taints most of penn  s work  his latest work even more so than the earlier . frank miller  robert rodriguez  clint eastwood  sean penn  the whole lot seem to produce such fundamentally banal product  ostensibly in some allegiance to honesty  but ending up being  for the most part  glorified pro wrestling matches  and moralistic  almost as if hallmark cards had developed a line of hell  s angels greetings  and make me long for the days of deliverance  which is a fine movie . viggo mortensen  s acting is much  much more believable here than that ridiculous eastern promises thing he did with cronenberg  and that  s about it . the movie is dead meaningless  and seems to be an exercise  a series of techniques  more than a story . kudos for charles bronson  however  who proves he can act . and i wanted more of sandy dennis  character . a lousy  out of   for this the indian runner crap .  ,0
where to begin . this movie started out as something that seemed like a rip  off of  darkness falls  . an old  disfigured woman living in the woods  giving kids presents for their teeth . sound familiar  then it changes . in  darkness falls   the tooth fairy only killed you if you saw her . the tooth fairy in this movie killed you no matter what . why did they need the rocker  his hippie girlfriend or the bubbas and their sister  i think the movie would  ve been fine without them . it seems like the producers sat around and decided that they needed to put extra people in the movie just so the tooth fairy would have people to kill . although  it  s nice to see a pretty blonde girl not being portrayed as a bubble  head for a change . okay to rent  but i wouldn  t suggest buying it .  ,0
the russian movie      follows the lives of three  not four  strangers who meet one night in a local bar . one is a musician  one a frozen meat seller and one a call girl .  br    br       i gather  is intended to showcase the dreariness and hopelessness of life in post  soviet russia  the characters have to make up stories to make their lives appear more interesting than they really are   but the movie is so incoherent and boring that i seriously doubt very many people will be able to sit all the way through it . there seems to be a suggestion running through the film that the shadowy russian government is up to some shady doings behind the scenes  operating secret cloning facilities  selling decades  old frozen meat etc .  but the movie is so formless and incomprehensible that i doubt anyone could figure out what anybody  s really up to here .  br    br   despite decent acting and a few incisively directed scenes     is a two  hour long endurance contest that should be avoided at all costs .  ,0
another chapter in the ongoing question  whatever happened to mel brooks  s sense of humor  it starts out nicely enough  with mel as trump  like mogul goddard bolt   you can call me god    who accepts a bet that he can  t live on the streets for   days . but the moment the movie hits the streets  it turns into a pathos  laden mess  with occasional  funny  bits interjected  mel sees a black kid break  dancing for money and tries to do a vaudeville buck  and  wing  yuk  yuk  . leslie ann warren is nothing short of wasted . the worst part is this movie  s musical number  in which brooks and warren do a silent dance to cole porter  s  easy to love .  brooks  s musical parodies are usually the highlights of his movies here he plays the whole thing straight  like a dancing excerpt from an aging guest star on  the carol burnett show   on which rudy deluca  this film  s co  writer  began his career  . go rent charlie chaplin  s the kid  which covered the same ground   years before and did a lot  ,0
i borrowed this movie from library think it might be delightful . how wrong am i   br    br   it is such a bad movie that i have to write something about it . mira sorvino is so bad in the movie  it is very painful to watch the scene with her . she is a pretty girl  but in this movie  she is not seductive at all  but i will have to witness her awkward attempt to seduce almost all the other major characters . it is so ridiculous .  br    br   and the dialog of the film is so pretentious  and lack the humorous fact that make then acceptable .  br    br   totally failure .  ,0
normally when i go on a raid of the local hollywood video i head towards the b  horror movies . to me the basic principals behind a b  horror movie is it  s camp value  heavy gore  lots of needless nudity  and special effects that anyone can put together with a pack of corn syrup and latex . i rented cradle of fear strictly because i  ve been a fan of the band since they released they  re first demo in     . the movie started off on an interesting note and then when i saw dani filth stomp on an extremely obvious latex mask i laughed . when i saw the lesbian sex scene for the sake of a lesbian sex scene i laughed even harder . i spent pretty much the entire movie laughing and when i wasn  t laughing i was shaking my head thinking about how a multi  million dollar rock star would want to make a movie that seemed like it was on a budget of multi  hundreds of dollars . the whole point of this movie to me seemed to attract the  hardcore goth kids who think death  destruction  sex  blood  and satan are the greatest things invented since lava lamps . that was really it . to me this movie seemed like   .   of the things that happened in this movie just happened for the sake of being satanic . this movie had a lot of potential and really could have been a real good movie but in the end this  movie  really is just an extended cradle of filth video .  ,0
a quite usual trashy italo  western  stupid storyline full of clichs and lack of logic  some mediocre actors  dirty settings  lots of punch  fights and people shoot dead on a massive scale .  br    br   this has nothing to do with django .  at least not in my german translated version  this german dvd  release is called  adios companeros  and has macho callaghan fighting against butch cassidy and ironhead because their gang killed his one  he  s the only survivor  . then you have butch cassidy and ironhead fighting each other because they quarreled and the gang split . and you have ironhead fighting against everyone because he  s just the biggest and most greedy asshole anyway . yeah  that  s it  no more cleverness in the storyline  hehe .  br    br   a small role by klaus kinski as reverend cotton is remarkable  that  s why i bought this dvd  . in one scene he attempts to separate two men fighting by hitting them and screaming  i said love   and in another scene he wins a competition in throwing horseshoes and goes nuts for a second  fantasticfantasticfantastic     br    br   it  s also remarkable that joe d  amato aka aristide massaccesi did the cinematography  i love this master of incompetent exploitation  thrash  so it was an  aahhh  for me .  ,0
while this movie  s style isn  t as understated and realistic as a sound version probably would have been  this is still a very good film . in fact  it was seen as an excellent film in its day  as it was nominated for the first best picture oscar  losing to wings  . i still consider wings to be a superior film  but this one is excellent despite a little bit of overacting by the lead  emil jannings .  br    br   jannings is a general from czarist russia who is living out his final days making a few bucks in the     s by being a hollywood extra . his luck appears to have changed as he gets a casting call   to play an imperial russian general fighting against the communists during the revolution . naturally this isn  t much of a stretch acting  wise  but it also gets the old man to thinking about the old days and the revolution .  br    br   exactly what happens next i  ll leave to you  but it  s a pretty good film   particularly at the end . by the way  look for william powell as the russian director . despite being made in      with the makeup he doesn  t look much younger than he did in many of his later films .  ,1
this movie is rated a classic on sentiment not on any quality of movie  making . it moves from the unlikely to the unbelievable  from the unrealistic to the ludicrous .  br    br   the unbelievable plot revolves around an attempt by two british soldiers and a hindu gofer to rescue a third soldier who has been captured by insurgent indians . in the later scene we see a full regiment with drum and bagpipes marching into an ambush . in the british army  a sergeant does not order up a rescue attempt  and if you get past that  he does not attempt it with only one other soldier and an indian servant when there is a full regiment on hand . the indian insurgents are so incredibly inept it is laughable . . . there are hundreds of them but they can  t hold their prisoner or kill the two rescuers  of course not . at one point we see the british soldiers throwing blocks of stone down from the battlements at the insurgents  who are scattered around the mountainside in ambush . . . one would have to have an eggplant for a brain to think this would do any damage . after cary grant as the rescued prisoner is shot  he lies on the floor looking around at the water boy . . . hardly the actions of someone who has been shot in the back . the water boy bravely blows a bugle  which comes from nowhere  to sound the alarm . . . this he does by standing up high on a wall so he can be seen and shot by the bad guys  and we shed a tear as he keeps trying to sound more notes as he is repeatedly shot and the bugle call breaks up into feeble squawks . . . instead of blowing the bugle while hiding behind cover as anybody with half a brain would do . this scene has deservedly been parodied in comedy sketches . if they wanted to make a buster keaton comedy  they should have hired keaton and done it better .  ,0
after tracking it down for half a year  i finally found a copy and it was not disappointing .  br    br   not disappointing because i  m one of those die hard smap fans who need to see all their works and i finally got to see the so called hot film of goro . but i couldn  t believe goro was forced to make a movie as such . in his respectable self now  i  m sure he cringes that he made this movie . nevertheless  they found the perfect person for looking embarrassed  ill at ease and half depressed most of the time .  br    br   man  i still can  t believe he made this movie . . . i had to cover my eyes at many parts not believing he really made such a movie . . . . hahahaha . . . .  br    br   but i  m glad to have watched it . thank goodness he has grown up . . . .  ,1
i saw the latter half of this movie about a year ago and was very happy to finally find it available on dvd . recently  i watched several of the reality series on pbs about ranching  etc . none of them came as close to telling the story as this movie does . based on real reality  pulling no punches  bleak  happy  tragic and enlightening  this is a movie that should be shown to students or to anyone interested in early frontier life . fine acting on the part of both rip torn and conchata ferrell add to an well done script . the opening credit states that it was done though funds supplied through the national endowment for the humanities . if this is the kind of product taxes could go to i would be happy to see more . i highly recommend it and would encourage people to tell a friend if you have seen it and enjoyed the film .  ,1
wow  i can  t believe i  m the first and only one to post a comment on this great movie .  br    br   although the movie itself seemed interesting enough the real thing that attracted me to this one is matt lillard  granted most people probably either think he  s too caffeine happy or just plain sucks but we  re both the same age and from the same generation and i  ve watched this guy so many times that he  s one of my favorites now . this is one of the few movies where he is the big shot and main star kind of like in slc punk  another great lillard film .  br    br   baiscally this is storywise your usual heist movies but with more twists than anything  which start to amount to craziness . also very notable in this movie is another great actor named vincent d  onofrio  a very under appreciated person in the film industry . the woman in the movie is a newcomer and she isn  t too bad although you know they hired her mainly for her accent and the nude scene    br    br   it  s a game of jack vs jill vs bob as each want to reap the rewards but share with no one . they all try to get eachother to kill off the other and it  s a timebomb waiting to explode . matt shows his true prowess as the scheming jack who initially starts the whole scheme . vincent and woman play a couple of art thieves who are in need of money due to a lack of business . vince  s character is a bit deranged and skitz  s throughout the movie but that only add to the intensity of the film .  br    br   the surprises left and right are well welcomed and the ending is very non cliche and makes you feel happy  well maybe that depends on the type of endings you like . this movie kept me very interested besides the fact matt was in it  it  s a great movie and i  d highly recommend it to anyone who likes movies . critic  s probably won  t like this movie  but they don  t watch movies cause they like movies anyway .  ,1
i  ve never been a huge fan of mormon films . being a mormon  i  ve always felt that the humor was too exclusive to the lds community and made us seem like a bunch of obsessive wackos . i was hoping this would be the breath of fresh air  the halestorm movie i could finally discuss with my non  mormon friends .  br    br   boy  was i wrong .  br    br   i figured  since this had b  list talent like clint howard  gary coleman  andrew wilson  and fred willard  one of my favorites   this would have to be at least a little funny . and besides  church basketball is ripe with potential for plenty of hilarious gags and such . but i must say  throughout the entire movie  it seemed as though no one knew what they were doing . every joke fell flat  and every opportunity for a genuinely funny gag went ignored . the dialogue was bland  and the film had some of the worst character development i have ever seen . every single character but wilson  s was less than one  dimensional . it  s hard to believe that after nine re  writes the film was still as mind  numbingly stale as the train wreck i witnessed . i can  t put into words the rage i felt sitting through this . my friends and i were extras in the final game scene  so we went to the premiere in washington city  ut . kurt hale  the director  was there  and i must say  i avoided all contact with him after the show . he waited at the door  seemingly ready for feedback . i couldn  t bring myself to tell him that his film not only ripped away a good hour and a half of my life  but it left a nasty  painful scar that i will never forget .  br    br   here are a few specific problems i had there was a minor love story subplot between the janitor and the chubby piano player  but these two characters came out of nowhere  and were impossible to care about  so my friends and i were left constantly wondering why we were supposed to care about these two lame  uninteresting characters . there were many subplots that popped up every now and then  each promising the audience the chance for laughs  but each one came and went in a puff of smoke  ending before you could even start caring . this was pretty much how the whole movie felt .  br    br   this film was a major letdown  and i feel bad for everyone who  s expecting the first real funny mormon movie . true  the jokes in this one aren  t too exclusive to mormons . then again  it  s hard to tell what was a joke and what was a loud ringing sensation in my ears .  br    br   please  do not see this movie . keep in your mind the fantasy that this movie is hilarious . spare yourself the disappointment i went through  ,0
ok so here  s the basic plot . it is      peter sellers is dr fu manchu  a    year old chinese man who has lived quite a long time . the film opens with his birthday in which he celebrates by drinking a special elixir that  even the film never mentions  prolongs his life . well on this occasion the elixir is clumsily dropped by an assistant  kato if you remember the pink panther movies  and he orders his minions to then go find  rare items to make the elixir . this creates a global man hunt in which his henchmen end up robbing museums of diamonds and venturing into london  to meet up with dr fu  s nemisis  a retired scotland yard detective nayland smith  also played by sellers who tries to stop him in what is suppose to be a witty comedic adventure .  br    br   this was apparantly sellers last full length feature film that he made before he died . the terrible tragedy is that he was in it . sellers who is such a gifted comedian and has had memorable  funny  roles in the panther movies and particualrly in the movie  the party   is anything but that in this film . this film was absolute torture to sit through and i couldn  t even finish it . he completly dies and i kept cringing while watching sellers performance . after coming of the great work of  being there  a year earlier how  i mean how can he make this and how did this thing even get made    like one person mentioned the first   . .   minutes are ok but then it is all downhill . . .  br    br   avoid like the plague .  br    br   rating  out of   .  ,0
i think scarecrows are creepy  so it  s a pity this movie doesn  t make more of them .  br    br   a bunch of robbers do an emergency parachute from a plane into a enormous field with scarecrows . one of them goes missing with the loot and so the rest chase him down while being set upon by inexplicably evil scarecrows . the acting is hammy and the scarecrows unimpressive  when they move  . on the positive side  the director does get some suspense out of the static scarecrows . it is as alfred hitchcock says   a bomb under a table goes off  and that  s surprise . we know the bomb is under the table but not when it will go off  and that  s suspense .   ,0
i  m an incorrigible skeptic and agnostic and was thus expecting to enjoy this film . after watching it  however  i honestly believe that i could have made a better documentary myself . its arguments appear to have only four spurious sources  despite his being listed in the credits on imdb i didn  t see richard dawkins anywhere   it  s edited together crudely with laughably amateurish computer effects  and it doesn  t make even the slightest attempt to appear impartial . the narration is pervaded throughout with a sneering  almost adolescent anti  christian sentiment  ruining any possibility that the film might actually change someone  s mind as opposed to just preaching to the choir  i . e . me  . though there is some interesting discussion of the historicity of jesus  the movie hits an unbearable snag when it begins to dwell heavily on the christian school which the director attended as a child  an institution which apparently scarred him badly psychologically as it obsesses him to this day .  br    br   though tgwwt obviously had a low budget  there was still an opportunity here to make an intelligent commentary on the highly questionable roots of christianity . there  s certainly a dearth of skeptically  minded religious documentaries on the market  and this film could have helped fill the void . instead  the director chose to insult our intelligence with this piece of garbage  which in the end appears to be some sort of therapeutic exercise for him . it  s too bad that his christian upbringing traumatized him  but he needn  t subject an audience to his coping mechanism .  ,0
as i sat subjected to this televised mediocrity  i wondered why  why did dianne keaton agree to this trash  the movie uses meaningless  contrived plot lines to deliver trash to homes of thousands . the movie takes a political agenda to a new level . the movie was meaningless  and all creditability was lost to the excessive use of stereotype .  br    br   it was obvious that keaton tried to make this movie worthwhile  but in the end she needs to remember the age old adage that you cannot polish a turd . i hope that you did not waste your new year  s day watching another mindless made for tv movie . i now know why the networks started airing series on sunday night  to rid us of trash   ,0
there is no question as to who is in command of the training of cadets in this film major chick davis  pat o  brien  . o  brien plays an officer who adheres to military discipline in the creation of a new kind of soldier from his cadets   the bombardier . but he is not so rigid as to be unfair or unfriendly . in fact  he even changes his opinion as to the value of women working in the military . he  s tough when he has to be  yet at other times he is a clear mix of coach and pastor  roles he perfected in other films . his character is the foundation of the action around which everything revolves . o  brien seems natural in the role  and plays it in fine fashion . two things help this movie o  brien  s performance and the spectacular special effects ending .  ,0
i can  t really condemn the movie because it does work . there is enough film noir elements to consider it a noir movie  but i think it  s only just in the category .  br    br   there  s nothing sinister in this piece  and that  s where the noir elements fail . sure  the disease might be considered sinister  but i have a hard time seeing that . the movie hints at a darker side blackie may be trafficking human beings  the new orleans police are only too willing to arrest a reporter  the specter of the plague hangs over all of the people in the movie . . . but those are really only hints .  br    br   there  s no attempt made to question reed  s motivations  as one with do with marlowe or spade  nor is there any attempt to bring a humans side to blackie  which would make him even more contemptuous if the human trafficking was actually played out .  br    br   that lack of depth is what fails the movie in the end .  br    br   the story is decent  the acting is good  the writing and direction are well done . . . but there is nothing to make this a movie you should return to over and over . worth watching once  maybe twice if you don  t remember it from years ago  and then putting away .  ,1
bette midler showcases her talents and beauty in  diva las vegas  . i am thrilled that i taped it and i am able to view whenever i want to . she possesses what it takes to keep an audience in captivity . her voice is as beautiful as ever and will truly impress you . the highlight of the show was her singing  stay with me  from her     movie  the rose  . you can feel the emotion in the song and will end up having goose bumps . the show will leave you with the urge to go out and either rent a bette midler movie or go to the nearest music store and purchase one of bette midler  s albums .  ,1
unfortunately this film    was a pathetic attempt of the true story of  studio   .  the only thing that was good about the picture was  mike myers  who was a joy to watch .  neve cambpell   although her role was little was unfortunately bad . the bottom line is that this film lacked a good performance from the actors  except one and that the conversion of the true story was a desperate attempt for a good screenplay .  ,0
my grandmother took me and my sister out to see this movie when it came out in theaters back in      and so we happily bought the tickets  the popcorn and soda  and walked right in to the theater and sat down to watch the movie . when it was over  the audience didn  t applauded strongly  i remember that i heard a few people say that they didn  t like it at all  i didn  t like it  i thought that it was rather stupid  and not worth seeing . eddie murphy was hysterical in this  but apart from him  the whole movie was bad  i rarely laughed at the parts in this  i also remembered that the other people in the theater almost hardly even laughed . and what i really thought was bad was making the animals talk  because talking animals only exist in cartoons  in live action movies  they are totally a mutt  i said that apart from eddie murphy  s hysterical twist he brings in  this movie is not worth watching  it is rather stupid .  br    br   i have seen eddie murphy in several of movies and i thought that he was funny in those  i have just said that he was the only funny part of this movie  i also have not seen eddie murphy in the really  great  movie  the adventures of pluto nash . this movie is not a movie that i would really recommend that you see  because apart from eddie murphy  you probably are not going to like this  especially because of a lot the the talking animals in it   br    br   i  ll give this movie a rating of  stars out of a possible   stars .  ,0
what is this crap  my little cousin picked this out obviously for the overly girlie dvd art and title . . . i decided to watch it with her so she didn  t get bored  and i sure was appalled at the horrible quality .  br    br   first  the acting was terrible . they seem like amateur actresses reading off of cue cards . the delivery is sub  par and very formulaic . scene cuts were terrible . . it looks like they took it straight from the story board  if there was one .  br    br   secondly  the jokes and stereotypes weren  t original or well played at all  again  very formulaic . i can  t count the times i was able to predict the next joke . i got a few chuckles out of the blatantly  subtle  sexual innuendos . the cat  the beaver patch  hung wong  . . c  mon  just . . stay away from this movie . it  s not cute  it  s not funny  it  s not even stupid  funny . it  s just stupid  stupid . it  s like a pg kids  movie with unnecessary sexual innuendo  vulgarity  and violence to bump the mpaa rating . stay away .  br    br    would you like to ride my yacht    br    br    is that what they  re calling it now    br    br    you could ride my ding .   br    br    oh  i think i got blood on my stool    br    br   badly played  sir .  ,0
i loved  the curse of frankenstein  so much that i rushed out to get  frankenstein must be destroyed  to see cushing at it again . . . even if it was without chistopher lee this time . to my great disappointment  this movie not only does without lee  but it does without frankenstein  s monster altogether  was it a case of  if we can  t get lee  we won  t have a monster at all   why would they do that  the monster is half the fun of the whole thing   this film is dedicated solely to the study of baron frankenstein and his quest to finish experiments he had begun in brain transplants before ending up in an asylum . i found the script extremely weak  with the need to suspend disbelief forced upon the audience a little too much . i  m willing to suspend a fair amount  but this movie got fairly ridiculous  which took me out of the film rather than immersing me in it .  br    br   peter cushing  though  is absolutely brilliant playing pure evil in this film . for being one of the most beloved actors and notoriously sweet men  he sure could play menacing and malevolent extremely well . the supporting cast is competent  but has little to do  even the young doctor and his fiance blackmailed into helping frankenstein . a bumbling police chief is introduced  along with his put  upon sidekick  to generate some comic relief  then they are completely dropped from the movie  why  we are led to believe that the police chief will be the main nemesis of the baron  then we are led to believe it will be the young doctor  and then it ends up being the victim of frankenstein  s brain transplant experiment . there was no tension  we weren  t invested in the  creature   and the ending was left so ambiguous as to leave one unsatisfied because it is so clear they are setting up another sequel .  br    br   also  there are virtually no  horror  elements . yes  there is a beheading in the beginning  off  camera   and we are treated to the sounds of cushing cutting the tops of two men  s skulls off  again  off camera   and there is the most unsettling and thoroughly unnecessary rape scene     of which is  again  off  camera  . i understand that there is a love of  letting the audience imagine it all  for their imaginations are far worse than what we can show   but come on  if you  re not going to give us a monster  then at least let us see the few  horrific  elements you do choose to include . showing us a skeleton in the lab lit with a green light is just not scary .  br    br   on top of a weak script  i thought the directing was mostly flat . there were a couple of nice shots  but otherwise no excitement  atmosphere  or suspense was generated . the same director did  curse  back in     and i thought it was brilliantly directed . . . guess he was as uninspired by this film as i was .  br    br   the movie gets a  out of   from me strictly for peter cushing  s powerful  nuanced performance . . . beyond that  i found little in this movie worth recommending . instead  my suggestion is to watch  the curse of frankenstein  and see a truly great hammer horror film .  ,0
i imagine victorian literature slowly sinking into the mire of the increasingly distant past  pulled down by the weight of its under  skirts . along comes television at its best  it has a redemptive power  and with dramatisations like those the bbc produce so finely  victorian literature gets a new stab at life . the religious themes  the moral overtones  may be increasingly ill at ease in a world no longer easily shocked  and acquainted with cohabitation  affairs and domestic violence . but those old  well  told stories have enduring power  and this is one  s a hidden gem .  br    br   it  s hard to gauge today just how forceful  feminist and extraordinary ann bronte  s masterpiece   the tenant of wildfell hall   actually was . emerging from the primeval slime of restrictive corsets  bodily  mental  societal  her heroine  helen huntingdon  escapes a miserable marriage  flees brutality and alcoholism  braves not only her abusive husband  s fury  but society  s pinched intolerance and malicious gossip  to wreak change in her life . she pays a price but retains her self  respect she falls in love along the way she emerges battered but victorious  and strong . i just love watching women like these on screen .  br    br   the actors are superb  the best brits have to offer . the love story is beautifully handled  with real passion and feeling by well  matched actors . tara fitzgerald inhabits every aspect of the complicated heroine  and as has been said here by other reviewers  no less sharply defined and beautiful a face could survive that petrifying hairstyle . toby stephens  striking sparks off her  contributes just the right combination of headstrong  handsome youth and passionate  yearning vulnerability . rupert graves  one of my favourite british actors ever  enjoys himself as the charismatic villain  so much so that you  re almost with him at the end . no one  s perfect  . the supporting cast ably create a world into which you sink without feeling that coarse compromises have been made to modern tastes  and without having felt preached to . another bbc classic  highly recommended this is how romantic literature should be dramatised .  ,1
i saw zp when it was first released and found it a major disappointment . its script seemed forced and arch and too fakey    s . it  s politics too upfront and ridiculous . and let  s face it  i was still under a love  spell known as blowup  and i still haven  t completely shaken it . now the  love  is twisted up with all sorts of nostalgia it evokes and  oh well . . . good luck to me   br    br   but time marches on and time has been kind to zp and time has been a teacher to me . i revisit this film about every ten years and it just gets better and better with age . and zp is it  s own  experience  and is only really linked to blowup through its creator  the late  great mr . antonioni .  br    br   twelve years ago  i had the great good fortune to see an absolutely pristine print  projected at its correct size  immense   restored by an italian government cultural agency who knows a good work of art when they see it and knows the importance of keeping such a thing of beauty in good shape . to this day i remember the gasp from the audience when the first shot of death valley appeared . it was like a thousand volt visual shock antonioni had intentionally delivered to wake us up to a new level of awareness . and indeed what follows from that point is an entirely different sort of  place  .  br    br   what is astonishing to me is how this film is coming into its own .  br    br   i remember the second time around seeing it    the early   s    i had begun to feel affection towards the film as a whole and towards daria and mark in particular . whereas  before these two seemed like a smart  alecky shadow version of zefferelli  s olivia and leonard  read romeo and juliet  they now were engaging me    particularly the girl in her insistent slo  motion  ality . she  took  her  time . . . to live . everything  everything dies around her .  br    br   upon exciting the theater the daylight of reality quickly began to erase my new found  enjoyment  . the encroaching shoulder  padded  big haired   s whispered  but that  s a hippie fantasy    let it go   br    br   the force of antonioni  s vision had  i had realised  already worked itself inside of me the first time around so i answered    s  with an  uh  huh  and guarded my  love  secretly  possessively and jealously .  br    br   but  this  then is what good art does it lives inside of you  and  if you wish it has its way and  loves  you back secretly  jealously  and possessively . and you get  changed  .  br    br   was thrilled to see that turner classic movies had decided to show zp in its march lineup . undoubtedly  zp must be seen on a gigantic screen so that it can truly take you into its constructed environment . but  hey  sometimes even a glimpse of the beloved in a newspaper photo is no better than no glimpse at all .  br    br   today reality hit  zp has been withdrawn mysteriously and replaced with the whiney antics of alice  s restaurant .  br    br   so  it is still too  difficult   too  disturbing   too  what    br    br   maybe it  s that  as with all good art  it lives while everything dies around it .  br    br   peace .  ,1
the tooth fairy is about the ghost of an old deformed witch that lures children to her house to get a prize for their loose tooth and then takes their lives . the first few minutes introduce you to the     beginning of the legend of the tooth fairy and then switches to present day . the worn out horror plot is pretty much saved by the solid acting . they could have done without the hammond brothers and a few other scenes  but overall the gore scenes were bloody but quick which had a minimizing effect . the eye candy is pretty good for both genders . camera work is good . dialog is fair but cheesy . i expected the film to be a bare bones  low budget  slasher with very few redeeming factors . i was surprised by the quality of the film .  ,0
in new york  andy hanson  philip seymour hoffman  is an addicted executive of a real estate office that has embezzled a large amount for his addiction and expensive way of life with his wife gina  marisa tomei  . when an audit is scheduled in his department  he becomes desperate for money . his baby brother hank hanson  ethan hawke  is a complete loser that owes three months of child support to his daughter  and is having a love affair with gina every thursday afternoon . andy plots a heist of the jewelry of their parent in a saturday morning without the use of guns  expecting to find an old employee working and without financial damage to his parents  since the insurance company would reimburse the loss . on monday morning  we would raise the necessary money he needs to cover his embezzlement . he invites hank to participate  since he is very well known in the mall where the jewelry is located and could be recognized . however  hank yellows and invites the thief bobby lasorda  brian f . o  byrne  to steal the store  but things go wrong when their mother nanette  rosemary harris  comes to work as the substitute for the clerk and bobby brings a hidden gun . nanette reacts and kills bobby but she is also lethally shot . after the death of nanette  their father charles hanson  albert finney  decides to investigate the robbery with tragic consequences .  br    br    before the devil knows you  re dead  is a comedy of errors  disclosing a good story . the originality and the difference are in the screenplay  with a non  linear narrative  la  pulp fiction  . the eighty  three year  old sidney lumet has another great work and it is impressive the longevity of this director . philip seymour hoffman is awesome in the role of a dysfunctional man with traumatic relationship with his father that feels the world falling apart mostly because of his insecure and clumsy brother . marisa tomei is still impressively gorgeous and sexy  showing a magnificent body . the violent conclusion shows that the world is indeed an evil place . my vote is seven .  br    br   title  brazil    antes que o diabo saiba que voc est morto    before the devil knows you  re dead    ,1
ok  i didn  t know what to expect when i saw the cover to fido  honestly when i came across it in the video store i was tempted to rent this movie  but nothing about it really grabbed my attention . but when i was looking around in netflix  they were advertising this like crazy if i liked  goofy  scary movies  so i figured to just give it a shot . i  m so glad that i did watch it  this was just a great movie  it was absolutely hilarious and so charming to watch . like i said  it  s pleasantville meets night of the living dead  it  s just a great concept  what does happen after a mega zombie attack  as we see in another zombie comedy  shaun of the dead  they have fun by making the zombies left over as  handy  citizens . this is a very overlooked horror  comedy movie  i think a lot of people were just so blown away with shaun of the dead that this got the boot . but it  s a great story and the cast was perfect and made this into just a really funny movie .  br    br   in a     s alternate universe where radiation from space has turned the dead into zombies . this radiation still plagues humanity  as all those who die after the original contamination turn into the undead . in order to continue living normal lives  communities are fenced with the help of a governing corporation named zomcon . zomcon provides collars with accompanying remote controls to control the zombies  hunger for flesh so as to use them as slaves or servants . in the town of willard  a housewife  helen  buys a zombie in spite of her husband bill  s zombie phobia . their son  timmy  befriends the zombie  naming him  fido  . one day fido  s collar malfunctions and he kills their next door neighbor  who turns into a zombie . timmy  kills  the zombified neighbor . when a pair of local bullies are blamed for the missing neighbor  they capture fido and timmy . helen comes and rescues timmy and fido from the bullies and they try to forget about the whole thing . several days later  the neighbor  s body is found and the murder is traced back to fido  who is taken away to zomcon where the public is told he will be destroyed . timmy learns through a friend that fido is simply working in a factory at zomcon . timmy sets out to rescue him with the help from his neighbor with a zombie girlfriend in hopes to get fido back .  br    br   i really do highly recommend this movie if you get the chance to see it  it  s so silly but a lot of fun . billy connelly did a great job as fido and really brought  no pun intended  a lot of life into the character . i think the scene that made me laugh the most was when timmy has to burry the old lady that fido attacked and killed  his last words to her were so funny   you weren  t really nice  but you liked flowers  so  and he buries her in the garden . not to mention the neighbor with the zombie girlfriend  sick  disturbing  wrong  but classic laughs . i still love how even though this is like the leave it to beaver  esquire type of world  there still is a lot of gore in the movie . so if you do have a chance to see fido  take it  i promise some good laughs .  br    br        ,1
i also saw this amazingly bad piece of  anime  at the london sci  fi festival . if you have to watch this thing  do so with a large audience preferably after a few beers  you may then glean some enjoyment from it .  br    br   i found the dialogue hilarious  lodged in my mind is the introduction of cremator . the animation is awful . it is badly designed and badly executed . it may have been a good idea for the producers to have hired at least one person who was not colour blind .  br    br   there  s nothing else to say really  this film is a failure on every level .  ,0
pretty good film from preminger labyrinthine at times  as it explores sets and locales from various angles and perspectives as if it were a nature film on the denizens of the modern city and how they live . in this sense it is visually and spatially satisfying  as its hero  a good cop with a bad temper  gets into very hot water when he accidentally kills a guy with a plate in his head .  br    br   dana andrews plays the lead as if it were hamlet  and has never been better . the story may be pure melodrama but andrews gives it weight  and almost raises it to the level of tragedy . as his girl  gene tierney is attractive but unremarkable . gary merrill makes for a very interesting villain  with his natural warmth providing a nice contrast to andrews  coolness his smiling  amiable  seeming bad guy seems to be continually challenging his nemesis by the mere fact of his being emotionally open  as opposed to the tightly wound and moralistic cop who is pursuing him .  br    br   there are no major surprises in this film  which seems transitional for all concerned . for director preminger it is a reunion of sorts with his laura stars  andrews and tierney  who were passing their career peaks at around the time the movie was made . the supporting cast    merrill  karl malden  neville brand   are  understandably  more optimistic  as they were all on their way up . preminger  as serene an observer as ever  lets the events unfold without expressing a strong point of view  as the morally ambiguous ending is somewhat disappointing  for the cat and mouse game between the two antagonists seems larger and more archetypal than any mere movie could contain  much less resolve .  br    br    ,1
we gave up at the point where george clooney  s character has his finger  nails extracted . we were not squeamish  having sat through an hour of this drivel we just knew what it felt like . to say this film was incomprehensible  boring  pretentious twaddle would be to over  praise it  how did people manage to sit through this confusing  slow  depressing pseud  s corner of a film  let alone nominate it for an oscar  clooney looked as ill as we felt watching him . what was he thinking  oh . . and what was with those subtitles   did we just have a dud dvd or was the original film done like that  sentences left hanging in mid  air  the film was hard enough to follow without that as well . i pity the cast  who obviously did their best with the material available .  ,0
just imagine what school would have been like in a world like this the kids are one big gang who have really good taste in music and unite against bad headmasters and teachers .  rock  n  roll high school  is taking place in that world . it  s like a ramones record coming to life . the characters are all as silly  innocent and charming as the ramones  songs  and the music itself is  of course  fantastic . high school comedies have really changed over the years  if you compare a movie like  american pie  with this late    s classic  where no tasteless sex jokes are made at all . since a remake is apparently in the works  it can probably be expected that the charm of the original will get lost along the way and will get replaced by vulgar  half  funny dick jokes  as bill hicks used to call them . however  the main problem will be that the ramones cannot be replaced . they were the perfect band for this movie and no one else could even come close to taking their place . so  the best thing to do would be to leave the original alone  as quirky and charming as it is . gabba  gabba hey   ,1
yes  indeed  it could have been a good movie . a love biangle   sorry for the poetical license  but is not a triangle   an interesting story  unfortunately badly told . the image is sometimes weird  sometimes ok  the picture looks crowded and narrow  sighted . the sound needs more attention  it usually does in romanian movies   the light and color filters are sometimes badly chosen . the soundtrack is short and is not helping the action . about the acting . . . sorry but the best actress is the landlady . the others are acting immaturely and cannot convince the viewer . the acting is poetical when it should be realistic  and realistic when it should be poetical . it  s a picture for adults  told by the children . bother only if extremely curious .  ,0
this is one of the worst things to ever come out of england  so that says a lot right there . the tension when we have to find out whether or not lembach is staying is amazing though . the upside is seeing the nice secretary  sheila  in her picnic table print underwear for awhile after being captured by dr . rat face . this movie has several views of london too although none of them are good . there is also a point in which there is almost a car accident which gets your heart rate back to just below normal . there is also a watch that gets teleported away  and the fear of the woman not getting her watch back is parallel to the horror of  the sixth sense  only a lot more dull and british . add on a furious gun fight between the british police and the dr . rat  which results in nothing  plus the electrocuting of a lot of people  plus a cat and you have yourself . . . ummm . . . a british movie . the mst  k version is pretty good although not one of there bests .  ,0
yes  as unbelievable as it may be  in     a musical won the academy award for best picture  and it was the third musical to win that award in a five  year period  the first being my fair lady in     and then the sound of music in     . the difference between my fair lady  the sound of music and oliver  however is that oliver  is immeasurably better  no comparison . the first two movies are insipid wet noodles compared to the remarkably robust oliver  . the acting is great the songs are great the story is great and the dancing is great . this movie is dynamic  topical  relevant to the human experience and unlike the overblown gangs of new york  oliver  offers a portrayal of poverty in   th century london  england that evokes sympathy without being condescending . oliver reed was a great actor and he proves it in oliver  the other actors and actresses  especially ron moody and shani wallis  are equally wonderful and offer powerful portrayals of characters who evoke sympathy and warmth without being caricatures .  ,1
this movie is poorly conceived  poorly acted  and poorly written .  br    br   jon heder is terribly annoying  and cannot escape the same napolean dynamite routine . self  obsessed and ignorant .  br    br   furthermore  diane keaton plays the same manish  overly obsessed mother  who cares too much and yet not nearly enough about the lives of her children  see because i said so  .  br    br   anna faris  though i generally like her  plays a vapid idiot in this film as well .  br    br   jeff daniels is passable but nothing special .  br    br   please  skip this film if you want to keep your soul .  ,0
i just rented creep and was not at all impressed . i didn  t feel anything in this film . i felt sick because the gore alone was shocking .  br    br   i walked out of my living room several times in desperation that something would happen with this film . haven  t we seen this all before  i didn  t like any of the characters barr the guy in the sewer cage . i felt bad for him . but then again i couldn  t think as to why he was still alive and not murdered by the creep  so many questions need to be answered .  br    br   someone mentioned references to the ps  game silent hill and i can see similarities vaguely .  br    br   not a bad film  not a good one . judge for yourself .  ,0
if you want to learn something about the spanish civil war and about all the political details and intrigues  let me tell you  you  ve chosen the wrong film .  br    br   this is a vision of the war as it happened in majorca  a small island off the coast of spain . when a war like this happens in a small island that takes position for the traitor almost at once  there is no war in the open . the soldiers are sent to the front to fight  in the mainland  while another kind of war happens at home  on the small island . there  neighbours tell on other neighbours  sometimes because their political views are contrary to the new regime  but many people are told on because of old family fights  or maybe the silent introvert who has no friends is told on by someone who wants to  earn some points  . and these things don  t happen in the open . there were some trials  true  but many other times people would just be woken up in the middle of the night  taken out of their homes to the closest cemetery where they would be killed . and the next morning the bodies would be found  and people would have an idea of what had happened  but nobody would dare to speak or to do anything . we  re not talking about soldiers killing someone they had never seen in their life . we  re talking about people killing their neighbours  and probably saying hello to their widow the next day  and even attending the funeral for the guy they had killed . we  re talking about villages with one or two thousand inhabitants  where everybody knew everybody .  br    br   i am from that small island and i  ve heard the stories my grandparents told me  and i must say that this film upset me  oh yes  it did but i also found it remarkably beautiful and moving . the initial violence is not something the director or the writer made up  that  s how things happened during that war . a kid knowing that his mate  s dad is in the fascist squad that killed his dad  completely possible . all that happened later on  possible too . tb was real too . at that time my island was not the holiday resort it has become . people were poor  illiterate  and worked in small farms . after the war there were times of hardship .  br    br   so  you won  t find a war story in this film  or at least not the kind of war story you expect . there are no battlefields  no soldiers  no political intrigues . this is the meanest kind of war  which happens when the space is limited  just check the size of the island   when neighbours fight with their neighbours  when members of the same family fight each other  and they live in a place where everybody knows everybody . you  ll find a story about the damage that this particular kind of war can cause to people and the story of how they survive that damage  or maybe they don  t .  br    br   i must mention the excellent work done by the writers who adapted the novel and by all the actors  who managed to sound really majorcan . that was remarkable .  ,1

like most people i was intrigued when i heard the concept of this film  especially the  film makers were then attacked  aspect that the case seems to emphasize  what with the picture on the cover of the film makers being chased by an angry mob .  br    br   then  to watch the film and discover  oh  what they mean by  the film makers were attacked  was some kids threw rocks at a sign and a number of people complained loudly and said  someone should beat those two kids up .  the picture on the cover   the chase  as it were  total fabrication . which i guess ties in with the theme of the film  lying and manipulation to satisfy vain  stupid children with more money and time then sense .  br    br   i have no idea what great truth the viewer is supposed to take away from this film . it  s like michael moore  s  roger  me   but if  roger  me  was moore mocking the people of flint . it  s completely misdirected and totally inane . wow  can you believe that people who suffered under the yoke of communism would be really excited to have markets full of food  what jerks  and it  s not so much   look at the effects of capitalism and western media blah blah blah   since it wasn  t just that their fake market had comparable prices to the competitors  it was that  as many people in the film say  the prices were absurdly low  someone mentions that they should  ve known it was fake by how much they were charging for duck . that  s not proving anything except that people who are poor  will go to a store that has low prices  bravo fellas  way to stick it to the people on the bottom .  br    br   way to play a stupid practical joke on elderly people . you should be very proud . how about for your next movie you make a documentary about iraq and show how people there will get really excited for a house without bullet holes in the walls and then  say   haha  no such house exists  your so stupid and loved to be lied to by the media   .  br    br   morgan  please like me  spurlock unleashed this wet fart of a film and it  s no surprise since spurlock as one hit wonder prince of the documentary world seems to throw his weight behind any silly sounding concept to stay relevant in a world that really has no need of him .  br    br   avoid like the plague .  ,0
redundant  everlasting shots  useless shots  useless scenes are what you will find in this film . in other words  it seemed technically poor to me . the musical bits are amateurishly directed  no synchronization in the would  be dancing  badly post  synchronized  bad and obvious improvisation of the actors from time to time  etc  .  br    br   the film is long and boring . eventually  it makes few point and even less sense .  br    br   there are some good ideas though . some of the comic elements are actually efficient  especially the opening scene . however  the film gets worse and worse so that it is completely unbearable and impossible to understand by the end .  br    br   the trailer i saw was very dynamic  that is not true for the film . that is to say the discrepancy between the trailer and the actual film is something very close to a rip off .  ,0
this great movie has failed to register a higher rating than   why not  it is a great portrayal of the life of christ without the ruthless sensationalism of the passion of the christ . johnny cash did great things for god which amazingly are shunned and neglected in areas where they should matter most  like our churches . the film itself took less than a month to film as johnny felt the strong presence of god guiding him through it . great credit to everyone involved in this overwhelmingly sincere movie which will always be cherished by its fans . at least the billy graham crusade rated it highly enough to use it as a prime source of education for new christians . thanks fox for producing it . as walk the line proved that it was freakish that this man survived yet alone produced such an underrated masterpiece . movies are not canonized through popular vote as this production proves  in summary i believe that this film is one of the worlds great documentaries as it is forthright  honestly portrayed and a great witness to the christian faith   ,1
may contain spoilers may contain spoilers  br    br   in the age of shrek  the movie   pixar  the studio   this is a much more traditional animation film . it put together some characters that normally wouldn  t be seen together  not to mentioned  try to save a human baby and bring it back to his father  . they begin as enemies and end as best friend . if this sound like a disney film  it is  only made through   th century fox  . the trailer to the movie was one of the best i  ve seen in ages  but the movie doesn  t live to the expectation the trailer set . the problem lie with the fact that the makers of the film didn  t made up their mind who is the target audience of the film . yes  there are some jokes in the film that only adults will understand but the film is mostly aimed at children . the parents will enjoy the fact that for   min . their children  s attention is focused on something else than them . the backgrounds are excellent and the voice are good but this is nothing more the a nice film . children will love this film  adults will only like it .  ,1
i know that some films  i mean european films   that are very bad films  are being regarded as great cinema by certain  critics   only because they  re non  american . i saw the  .  imdb score for this film and noticed the fact that this was being selected for certain big festivals . don  t let this fool you  unless you  re one of those people that likes mind  numbing films like this  and call it great art afterwards  skip it  the film contains one hilarious scene after another  a similar  italian  film popped into my mind  the terrible preferisco il rumore del mare  i prefer the sound of the sea   . the problem with these films is that they  re not only boring  like some other strangely praised films  but that they almost play like camp . i mean  let  s face it  the acting is horrible  i mean soap opera  level   the story has not one surprise  this has been done endless times before  connecting several storylines short cuts  magnolia  playing by heart  only much better   not one realistic character in it  some true freak  seeing along the way  notice the hilarious zombie  like daughter   and so on and so on .  br    br   as if that  s not enough  the film is    min .  count it   long  and at the end the director opens his can of sentimentality . after a film with such hilariously bad dialogue and scenes that made the public at the preview screening laugh at so much incompetence  well . . . this is an insult to cinema  and only receives high ratings because it happens to be in  another  language  in this case spanish . strange world we live in . . .      ,0

this was thought to be the flagship work of the open source community  something that would stand up and scream at the worlds media to take notice as we  re not stuck in the marketing trap with our options in producing fine work with open source tools . after the basic version download  die hard fan here on a dial  up modem  eventually got here i hit my first snag . media player  mplayer classic  winamp failed to open it on my xp box  and then totem  xine  kaffeine failed to open it on my suse server . mplayer managed to run it flawlessly . going to be hard to spread the word about it if normal users cant even open it . . .  br    br   the film . beautiful soundtrack  superb lighting  masterful camera work and flawless texturing . everything looked real . and then the two main characters moved . . . . and spoke . . . and the movie died for me . everything apart from the lip syncing and the actual animation of the two main characters  except for proog in the dancing scene  looked fluid and totally alive . the two main characters were animated so poorly that at times i was wondering if there are any games on the market at the moment with cut  scenes that entail less realism than this .  br    br   any frame in the movie is fantastic . . as a frame  and the thing is great if neither actors are moving . i  m so glad i haven  t actually recommended this to anyone . i  d ruin my reputation .  br    br   oh  and final fantasy had a more followable and cunningly devised plot .  br    br   this movie would get   stars if it wasn  t for the tragedy that sits right there on the screen .  ,0
director raoul walsh was like the michael bay of the     s and years before that . and i mean that in a positive way  since i  m definitely ain  t no bay  hater . his movies are just simple high quality entertainment  just like the raoul walsh movies were in his days .  br    br    gentleman jim  is fine quality entertainment . besides a first class director  it also features a first grade cast  with raoul walsh  s regular leading man errol flynn in the main part .  br    br   what surprised me was how well the boxing matches were brought to the screen . they used some very dynamic camera  work  which also really made the boxing matches uplifting and exciting to watch  with the end championship fight against john l . sullivan as the ultimate highlight .  br    br   biopics of the     s and earlier on were obviously still very much different from biographies being made this present day . modern biographies often glorify its main subject and show his  her life from basically birth till death and everything  mostly emotional aspects  in between .  old  biopics were just made the same as movies that weren  t based on actual real life persons  which also means that the film  makers would often use a use amount of creative liberty with the main character  s personality and events that happened in his  her life . this movie is also not just a biography about a boxing legend but also forms a nice portrayal from the period when illegal bare knuckle fighting entered the modern era of boxing .  br    br   errol flynn does a great job portraying the real life famous boxer james j . corbett aka gentleman jim . not too many people known it but flynn did some real good acting jobs in the     s  of which this movie is one . fysicaly he also looks in top  shape . he also looks quite different by the way without his trademark small mustache in this movie . the movie also features some fine supporting actors and some fine acting throughout .  br    br   a great and entertaining movie that also still truly holds up real well today .  br    br        ,1
one of the serious potential environmental costs of most mining operations is pollution of downstream streams  rivers and lakes with excess sediments and toxins . one of the most serious examples in   th century usa of excess river sedimentation was caused by hydraulic mining of gold  bearing gravely hills on the sides of the sacramento valley in the period from the     s to the early     s . this process involved directing a high pressure jet of water onto the hillside  causing the material to wash downhill  where the gold could be separated from the gravel and sediment . the sediment then collected in a ditch or stream and most found its way to the sacramento river or its tributaries . the sediment that stayed in the river bed increased the likelihood of floods in the downstream agricultural fields and towns and created permanent marshes in some areas . some of the sediment spilled over onto the agricultural fields  where it might cover a standing crop or cover more desirable soil or make plowing difficult . thus  the conflicting interests of the companies that used hydraulic mining and of the downstream farmers adversely affected by these operations is the subject of this nearly forgotten     color film by warner .  br    br   first  we might ask why warner decided to shoot this film in a rather poor technicolor  a very rare treatment in     . a story about wheat farmers and gold miners wouldn  t seem to justify the expense and difficulties of color filming at this time . the answer seems to be the inordinate film time spent indoors  with fancy colorful clothes and ornamentations . then  we might ask why colorless george brent was chosen as the leading man and ultimate hero  to be paired with olivia de havilland . among other things  this film really needed a charismatic leading man to carry it . even the usually colorful gabby hayes  in his small role  seemed unusually subdued . unfortunately  i fell asleep before the apparently more dramatic last part of the film . the portion i saw spent too much time establishing a complicated set of relationships between too many people at the expense of graphically portraying the plight of the chosen wheat baron and perhaps nearby town folk and their attempts to deal with their flood and sedimentation problems . it needed to be more like  the good earth   released just the year before . just maybe it would then have been suitable for a charismatic leading man  such as errol flynn . finally  there is the matter of the inane title . surely  warner could have come up with a catchy or more appropriate title .  gold or grain  is short and to the point . incidentally  i understand there is still plenty of gold in  them thar hills   waiting to be extracted by means other than hydraulic mining .  ,0
this movie is a great example of how even some very funny jokes can go terribly wrong . i really expected at least something from this movie after seeing the add which was funny as hell but the movie wasn  t half as good .  br    br   the weird part is that the jokes are actually funny  the spoofs of the smoking ban  jo bole . . . etc . are genuinely good jokes but i don  t know whom to blame this movie flop on .  br    br   the prime candidates may be    the hammers  actors  and hammeresses  actresses  and not even the funny kind   the director   the guy who cast the actors and  or the director anyway if you are really really bored and i mean really see this movie  or else get a copy of each and every ad or teaser of this movie and laugh your butt of because those will be far funnier than the film .  br    br   p . s the only saving grace of this film is mahesh manjrekar and the funny chappu bhai  ,0
in  die nibelungen siegfried   siegfried was betrayed . now  kriemhild seeks revenge . she marries hagen  and through a series of events  finally engages in a very drastic  but fitting  action at the end .  br    br   one of the things about watching this movie nowadays is that we can look at certain portrayals . attila the hun  called etzel in the movie  is shown as the strange person from the east  possibly an allusion to the soviet union . obviously  it was not fritz lang  s fault that hitler used  the nibelungenlied  for german national pride in the third reich  but one can see what the fuhrer liked about the story . nonetheless  this is an absolutely formidable movie .  ,1

i thought this movie was pretty good . some parts were corny but that  s understandable since it was made more than   years ago . i thought the best performance in the movie was given by michele morgan who played millie convincingly . jack haley is also really good as mike o  brien . even though i  m not a big frank sinatra fan  i think he was very good in this movie . if your have a craving for a silly  over the top musical comedy  higher and higher is the movie for you .  br    br    ,1
while this was a better movie than    dalmations  live action  not animated version   i think it still fell a little short of what disney could do . it was well  filmed  the music was more suited to the action  and the effects were better done  compared to     . the acting was perhaps better  but then the human characters were given far more appropriate roles in this sequel  and glenn close is really not to be missed  as in the first movie . she makes it shine . her poor lackey and the overzealous furrier sidekicks are wonderful characters to play off of  and they add to the spectacle disney has given us . this is a great family film  with little or no objectionable material  and yet it remains fun and interesting for adults and children alike . it  s bound to be a classic  as so many disney films are . here  s to hoping the third will be even better still  because you know they probably want to make one .    ,1
i do not expect this film to be well understood by viewers out of romania . this tells something certainly about the value  or maybe about the lack of universality of the film  but also tells something about how different history and even life of common people was in romania compared to other countries  even in eastern europe .  br    br   the film is an adaptation of a novel by marin preda  a controversial novelist who died during the communist rule soon after the book was published . it tells the story of an intellectual  professor of philosophy whose life is crushed after he is imprisoned on false accusations at the end of the stalinist era . basically the first part of the film tells the story of his fight for survival in prison  the second describes his tentative to regain his life after being released . his release is actually only apparent  romania of the   s asks from him different types of compromises and crimes  but yet his fight for survival is as tough morally as in prison .  br    br   the film is splendidly acted by some of the best romanian actors . stefan iordache who has the lead role would be in another time and another place a mega  star  we can get here a good glimpse of his fabulous acting art . although suffering from a hesitant story  telling and falling sometimes in non  essential details or character comics  the film is still an important landmark for the romanian cinema  as well as for the process of recovering the moral and historic values in the romanian society .  ,1
jake  s closet has the emotional power of kramer vs . kramer combined with the imagination of pan  s labyrinth . even the beginning special effect seems to give a nod to pan  s labyrinth . but this is a story that takes place in modern times  not in a war sixty years ago and in that way it has even more resonance today . jake  s closet is about a boy  an only child  practically alone on summer vacation  dealing with his family falling apart . it  s a horror movie like the others and the sixth sense  a horror movie for the thinking person . if you  re looking for a slasher movie  this won  t be your cup of tea but if you  re looking for a story that is both touching and suspenseful with good acting  this is the movie for you . at the screening i saw  i swear there was one moment where the entire audience screamed . i highly recommend catching this film .  ,1
infamous pre  code film  really the one film that caused people to insist on the hayes code being strictly enforced . barbara stanwyck stars as a young girl whose liquor  selling father has no problem pimping her out to customers . when he dies in an accident  she  s released out into the world with the knowledge that her nubile body can get her whatever she wants . she goes to new york and proceeds to climb the corporate ladder  one bed at a time . although obviously there  s no actual sex shown  the film is quite sleazy . unfortunately  after the initial shock value fades  around the time stanwyck screws a rail car inspector so she can travel for free   the film becomes a tad repetitive and dull . stanwyck herself is the only thing that keeps the film worth sitting through . as always  she  s fantastic .  ,1
i don  t know what you guys are talking about  the first time i watched this movie with two of my friends we couldn  t stop crying . this is one of the funniest shits i  ve ever seen . that comment about the porn is so right though hahahaha .  br    br   yeah this movie actually is the worse  but it did bring tears to my eyes due to the phony characters  poor dialog and acting . not to mention the expensive cameras they used to film it   it looks like one of those movies out of my drivers ed . class . the props look like they came out of a high school drama show . the music sounds like it is from an original nintendo system game . the only thing that even came close the scaring me about this movie was that it had a killer clown which  who isn  t creeped out by fat  lurking clowns  hahaha if someone were to ever watch this though  they need to look out for the actors verbal errors like lisping on words and some of their facial expressions . hahahaha i died .  br    br   susan  ,0
once i watched the tenant and interpreted it as a horror movie . it uses many of the tropes of the genre the sinister apartment  suspicious neighbors  apparitions  mysteries  hallucinations . the life of the hero  trelkovsky  seemed surrounded by evil  secret forces trying to drive him mad .  br    br   last time i watched it i challenged this initial interpretation . if this movie is a horror movie  it  s only horror in the sense that a kafka novel is horror . in fact this movie can be understood on a literal level as a lonely man slowly becoming crazy without any external influence .  br    br   polanski made in his career three movies dealing with madness repulsion  which i don  t particularly like because the development of madness in the heroine never convinced me rosemary  s baby  in which the heroine is driven mad by evil forces and the tenant  which might be the best study of paranoia ever made in cinema .  br    br   trelkovsky is a young man who rents an apartment in which a woman killed herself . he becomes obsessed with her and slowly starts becoming her he wears her clothes  puts on makeup  talks like her . but is he being possessed by a spirit  or is he just letting his wild imagination get the best of him  it  s this hesitation between what is real and imaginary  and which polanski never resolves  that makes this such a fascinating movie . many events in the movie can be attributed to the supernatural as easily as they can be to normal causes  and it  s up to the viewer to decide what to believe in .  br    br   although this is not my favorite polanski movie  it is nevertheless a good example of his ability to create suspense and portray madness in very convincing terms . and technically speaking  it  s a marvel too . suffice to say he collaborates with film composer philippe sarde and legendary director of photography sven nykvist  bergman  s dp  in the making of this movie . a slow pacing and sometimes uninteresting segments may make this movie difficult to enjoy  but it  s an experience nevertheless .  ,1

why in the world would someone make this piece of trash movie  the first two zombie bloodbath movies were stupid enough  but this takes the cake for the worst of the trilogy  perhaps of all time  . todd sheets is still the director  but no longer the screenwriter  which isn  t a negative or a positive  considering he  s just as untalented as the guy who wrote this one . the writing is too heavily reliant on the f  word  which is used somewhere between    and    times at nausea . the acting is about on par with the last two bloodbath movies  so naturally  it  s some of the worst i  ve ever seen . the special effects are better than the last   but they still look godawful . the plot has become too complicated for it  s own good  and was about some government experiment gone wrong and zombies being produced . also featured is cryogenically frozen mutant zombie and school kids that know how to time travel  leading to one of the most idiotic endings i  ve ever seen . after the movie it goes to outtakes  which is strange because this whole movie is an outtake . only see this to make fun of it  because if you go into this with a serious mind  you might possibly kill yourself .  br    br   my rating bomb   .   mins .  ,0
even though this movie came out a year before i was born  it is definetely one of my favorite comedies . it stars redd foxx as a father who tries to understand his son  s homosexuality . like most parents  he doesn  t know a thing about what it means to be gay and has all of these stereotypical notions of what gay people are like . his son  norman  is now grown up and living on his own . when his father  ben  finds out that his son is gay  he pays his son a visit in hopes of changing him . the title comes from one of the funniest lines in the movie   when ben gets to norman  s apartments he runs into a female prostitute and thinks it  s his son in drag   norman . . . is that you    . the movie had me laughing from start to finish . redd foxx is great . although a lot of the content is stereotypical  i didn  t find anything offensive about the way the material was handled  and it even has a good ending . highly recommended .  ,1
once in a while in indian cinema there comes along a movie like sholay that changes the way the audience perceives a good movie . and den just once in a while  hopefully  we have a rgv ki aag that breaks all the standards and creates one of its own . a standard so low  it can never be broken . ram gopal varma manages to take a melting pot of talent and create a dish so stale u can smell it from a distance . to take a classic like sholay and assassinate it is totally unforgivable and i can  t believe he almost called the movie rgv ki sholay . although sholay had a lot of folklore elements in it  the movie managed to build on its plot by merely defining the characters so distinctively that they lived on forever . what aag does is take these characters and mess them up so badly u  ll need a contest to pick the worst . the realism element is totally missing and what the movie ends up providing is a bunch of  actors  parading along in a plot less and seemingly unrelated set of events . one star for this film is a ridiculous waste of a vote . its time for rgv to wake up to the reality of his failure and conjure up another  different  plot that can be categorized under cinema .  ,0
there  s a lot of good that can be said for this cartoon the backgrounds are rich  lushly colored and full of nicely done art deco details . the animation is up to the usual studio standards of the time  which are unquestionably higher than those of the present day . however  i find it tedious for a number of reasons .  br    br   the music it  s definitely not up to scott bradley  s usual standards . although it  s probably supposed to be evocative of a  great gatsby  setting  it ends up being dreary  sleepy  repetitious and monotonous  repetitious and monotonous are not the same  as beethoven  s  th symphony attests  . since most people  including me  tend to close their eyes when they yawn  there  s a lot of the visual part of the cartoon that will be missed by the average viewer .  br    br   the storyline i  m not giving away any secrets that aren  t already in the plot summary  country good  city bad . this is a common theme in films  both animated and live  from this era . it  s a misplaced nostalgia for a nonexistent rural idyll  which  in the present day  is reflected in a similar nostalgia for  values  that never were .  ,0
this is like  crouching tiger  hidden dragon  in a more surreal  fantasy setting with incredible special effects and computer generated imagery that would put industrial light and magic to shame . the plot may be hard to follow  but that is the nature of translating chinese folklore to the screen certainly the overall story would probably be more familiar to its native audience . however  an intelligent person should be able to keep up moreover  the martial arts scenes potency are amplified by eye popping cgi .  ,1

in today  s world of digital fabrication  there is no computer than can replace the actor and writer . alas  this type of  character driven  film is far too rare these days . duvall  s performance as well as james earl jones are faithful to their audience  s high expectations . i wonder if this movie was made for tv  it has a  close  up  personal quality to the narrative . it is an understatement to say that the performances are all outstanding . the only thing that keeps it from being a cinema masterpiece is the lack of a great cinematographer  but pretty pictures are not everything . how can talent the likes of jones and duvall continue to produce such fine work in an age where actors pose for the digitizing   ,1
when i saw previews of this movie i thought that it may be dumb  but it will at least be funny . well i was wrong . even though somewhere deep down the producers had an interesting message to convey about parents being left alone and re  evaluating their life  the way they tried to deliver that message was horrible . the first fifty times something silly happened to the couple was relatively funny . but by the end  i could almost predict what stupid mishap is going to happen next .  br    br   throughout the movie i like a total of maybe five lines of dialogue and everything else was at best mediocre  which is still more than i can say for the movie itself .  ,0
as the faux  russian scientist says two  thirds of the way into the movie   i came for the science .  this pretty much sums up the reason i watched this movie  anything that involves a half  man  half  hammerhead shark definitely deserves a serious empirical investigation on the part of an impartial aspiring scientist . or  as they say in the biz  my girlfriend  s brother had the remote and the rest is history . to say that the special effects were bad would be a disservice to the field of special effects . this is      it is not that hard to film a car scene without a cheesy bluescreen background . yeah  this was charming and state of the art when hitchcock was filming  the birds  but in     it just looks low budget . spare me the cheap attempt at sci  fi and do me the service of actually making an attempt at the willing suspension of disbelief .  br    br   however  having seriously defamed the overall concept of this film  let me tell you again that  as sad as it may sound  this is probably worth your time . if nothing else  it is a tour de force of bad sci  fi  worth the education for the new movie buff and certainly worthy of a refresher course for those who have seen a few movies in their day .  br    br   the crazy hunchback mad scientist with a hammerhead transceiver who thinks it is a good idea to spoon canfuls of blood into the nearby water makes me question not only the intelligence of mankind  but also the ability of  b  movie writers to come up with remotely plausible plot lines .  br    br   this film also pretty much fulfills one of my longtime bad movie contentions  bad guys always wear sunglasses .  br    br   if this weren  t      i would be deadset on the fact this film was some sort of insanely poor metaphor for the cold war . i mean  you might as well have khan on the bridge of a klingon bird of prey inserting leaches into chekhov  s ear .  br    br   one of the most moving lines of the movie is when the chick without the bra insists that the charlton heston lookalike   wait for tom  as he is trying to lift the escape helicopter off the ground . the thing is  tom is wasting the bad sunglass guys with his never  ending banana clip attached to his kalashnikov  or ak     in layman  s terms .  br    br   as the mad scientist says near the end of the film   my goal is to evolve the human species   suffice it to say that this movie contributed only to a devolution of humankind . the faint freudian references uttered by the mad scientist as he prepping the female protagonist to be mated with a hammerhead shark are a simple reminder that even in the worst of science fiction we can all find something to laugh about .  ,0

i watched  elephant walk  for the first time in about   years and was struck by how similar the story line is to the greatly superior  rebecca .  as others have said  you have the sweet young thing swept off her feet by the alternately charming and brooding lord of the manor  only to find her marriage threatened by the inescapable memory of a larger  than  life yet deeply flawed relative . you have the stern and disapproving servant  a crisis that will either bind the couple together or tear them irreparably apart  climaxed by the fiery destruction of the lavish homestead .  br    br   meanwhile   elephant walk  also owes some of its creepy jungle atmosphere to  the letter   the bette davis love triangle set on a singapore rubber plantation rather than a sri lankan tea plantation .  br    br   maltin gives  elephant walk  just two stars  and imdb readers aren  t much kinder  but i enjoyed it despite its predictability . elizabeth taylor never looked lovelier  and peter finch does a credible job as the basically good man unable to shake off the influence of his overbearing father . dana andrews   a favorite in  laura  and  the best year of our lives    is wasted as elizabeth  s frustrated admirer . the real star is the bungalow  one of the most beautiful interior sets in movie history .  ,1

this is a fantastic series first and foremost . it is very well done and very interesting . as a huge wwii buff  i had learned a lot before seeing this series . one of the best things this has going for it is all the interviews with past individuals back when the war was relatively fresh in their minds  comparatively speaking that is . it is nothing against the men that you see getting interviewed in the programs of today  it is just that most of these men weren  t really involved in the upper echelons of what was happening then . one of the best parts is the narrating by sir laurence oliver . i would recommend this to anyone that wants to learn about wwii  but really think only the die  hards  such as myself  will want to buy this or watch it more than once . my only real complaint about this entire series is that some of the facts aren  t quite as accurate as we now know . especially with the information about soviet union is exaggerated or just plain inaccurate in places . that information is now different we now know because of the fall of the ussr . overall a fascinating look at wwii and a must see for any serious wwii historian professional or personal alike .  ,1
there  s a lot the matter with helen and none of it  s good . shelley winters and debbie reynolds play mothers of a pair of leopold  loeb like killers who move from the mid  west to hollywood to escape their past . reynolds  a starstruck jean harlow wannabe  opens a dance studio for children and winters is her piano player . soon winters  as helen  begins to crack up . it  s all very slow going and although there are moments of real creepiness  nasty phone calls  a visit from wino timothy carey   the movie is devoid of any real horror . nevertheless  it  s still worthy entertainment . the acting divas are fine and the production values are terrific . a music score by david raskin  cinematography by lucien ballard and oscar  nominated costumes contribute mightily . with this  a place in the sun and lolita to her credit  does anyone do crazy as well as winters  directed by curtis harrington  a master at this type of not quite a  movie exploitation . in addition to carey  the oddball supporting cast includes dennis weaver  agnes moorehead  as a very aimee semple mcpherson like evangelist   yvette vickers and michel macliammir  the irish orson welles  as hamilton starr  aptly nicknamed hammy .  ,0

i got this dvd well over  years ago and only decided to watch it yesterday . i don  t know why it took me so long as i do like the inspector gadget show and even the new gadget and the gadgetinis . while it may have a bright color pallet and all the technical sophistication of a modern animated movie  there are some old things missing that bog this gadget right down the toilet .  br    br   first of all the classic inspector gadget theme song and music is completely absent . the composer tries to compromise by doing a score that sounds similar but it  s still just no good enough . the gadget  mobile is now a talking car  not a car that can turn into a van . plus it looks a lot cuter and rounder instead of being plain cool . penny no longer has her computer book and she and brain hardly make an appearance at all .  br    br   the plot is non  existent . there  s something about a transformation formula and doctor claw using for some never revealed evil but that  s all i got . what the deal was with the short  giant italian guy i will never know . it had nothing to do with anything .  br    br   and if the title is anything to go by  his last case is wrapped up in no way whatsoever . and he stays on the force so why it  s called  last case  is a mystery also .  br    br   i wasn  t impressed at all . this is an affront to a great animated show that is strangely absent on dvd  but don  t let that prompt you into buying whatever inspector gadget dvds you can . i sold this mere seconds after finally watching it . no kid will like or appreciate this and no fan of the old show with tolerate it .  ,0
i have seen romantic comedies and this is one of the easiest  worst attempts at one . a lot of the scenes work in a plug  and  play manner inserted strictly to conform to the romantic  comedy genre . usually this is okay because we  re dealing with a genre  but the challenge generally resides in making it original  new and inventive . this movie fails to do so .  br    br   there is no sense of who the characters really are  apart from sylvie moreau  s  who is the real star of this movie  not isabelle blais  . they fit into this one  dimensional clich and they become nothing more than simple puppets serving the purpose of a very light narrative .  br    br   the pacing of the movie can become annoying  rhythm lacks  and the editing is filled with unnecessary close  ups . i should also mention the overly stylized decors making some scenes devoid of any naturally  or rather  making the attempt at naturally seem too obvious . of course  along with that  you have the right  on  cue sappy music which unfortunately often sounds mismatched .  br    br   i can  t believe that a movie who makes obvious woody allen allusions ends up being this deceptive . if you expect a good light  hearted romantic comedy  this is not it . or rather  this a poor attempt at it . you will only leave the theater wondering why this film has been getting such praise when cinema is now more than    years old and there are far superior quebecois directors making better flicks .  br    br   les aimants is a good movie for what it is . but it  s a bad one if you regard cinema as an art and directors as auteur  s .  ,0

i thought this was a very clunky  uninvolving version of a famous australian story . heath ledger and orlando bloom were very good in their roles  and gave their characters some personality but the whole thing felt forced and mechanical .  br    br   the beginning could have been a lot more involving perhaps starting with a shootout  and then flashing back for a recap of how they got there or that sort of thing . and i felt like every scene was routinely predictable and signposted  like a very bad tv soap .  br    br   i was really looking forward to this movie  and hoping for something a lot better . the only thing i can say in its favour is that it beats the mick jagger version  but not by much .  ,0
having set the sitcom world alight with  father ted  arthur matthews and graham linehan  s next creation was a forgotten gem for the bbc called  hippies  although created by the pair  the six scripts were written by arthur matthews alone .  br    br   set in london in      ray purbs  a hippy  is the editor of an anarchist magazine . his friends are his flat  mate  the very laid back and cannabis smoking alex  his  girlfriend  is feminist jill and the none too bright hugo .  br    br   simon pegg was superb as ray  but he is superb in everything he is in . this sitcom had a feel of  citizen smith  about it . ray was very much like wolfie smith  trying to beat society  but failing miserably . at last this sitcom is going to be released on dvd in march  i can  t wait to buy it . as it was on in     and has yet been repeated on terrestrial television  my memories aren  t too good of the sitcom  yet i remember two episodes really clearly  the first being the opener  protesting hippies  which i thought was a great start  where ray goes on a protest against sandpaper and the other episode was  hippy dippy hippies  which i think was episode   again quite a clear memory about the police . sadly  the sitcom got a negative reaction from viewers  i can  t think why  . the bbc commissioned another series  but arthur matthews decided against it because of the negative reaction . oh well  i can  t wait for the dvd .  br    br   best episode hippy dippy hippies  series  episode  .  ,1

pickup on south street is one of the most brilliant movies ever made . an example of the directing when candy  jean peters  starts going through her purse and notices her wallet is missing  an alarm goes off in the background in the building she  s in   as if it  s an alarm going off in her head . it  s not cartoon  like   it  s subtly woven into the background in a way that strikes you on a subconscious level until you  ve seen the film a few times and it just  clicks  that there  s an alarm bell going off when she starts frantically going through her bag .  br    br   richard widmark is way on top of his game as a smart  alec   he  s really great   but the highlight performance of the film was the first scene for  moe   the street peddler  informer  played by thelma ritter . later  in her apartment  you are not seeing a movie   you  re seeing a real person . i  ve never seen anyone  act  so real i felt like i was looking into a real room until ritter  s performance   right down to the way her hair stuck out a bit when she removed her hat .  br    br   about a million other things just worked   from the way lightning louie picks up money with his chopsticks to the way candy  s jewelry clicks when she flicks moe  s hand away from her brooch  to the way moe gets the dollars and change from the police captain across the fbi guy  s chest   and even the way the captain opens his filing cabinet  like he  s been doing it in that way in that room for many years .  pickup on south street  is detailed moves  directing  with consummate performances  acting  and superb now  nostalgic visuals of the day  such as the panel truck  the boards leading to the shack out on the water  the dumbwaiter    and the unforgettable place skip stashes his pocket pickings . wonderful stuff .  br    br    pickup on south street  is also one of the few movies where  even though the characters aren  t perfect  you do care about them   perhaps because they have been somewhat branded by their pasts in ways that are hard to escape skip as a  three  time loser  and candy as a youngish woman who has  knocked around  a lot . when these people behave a little more badly than you  d expect  it  s in sort of novel ways that make it seem you  re looking in at people you  d never otherwise imagine   and yet you know that they are possible because the actors make them so recognizably human .  ,1
my father  dr . gordon warner  ret . major  us marine corps   was in guadalcanal and lost his leg to the japanese  and also received the navy cross . i was pleasantly surprised to learn that my father was the technical adviser of this film and i am hoping that he had an impact on the film in making it resemble how it really was back then  as i read in various comments written by the viewers of this film that it seemed like real  life . my father is a fanatic of facts and figures  and always wanted things to be seen as they were so i would like to believe he had something to do with that .  br    br   he currently lives in okinawa  japan  married to my mother for over   years  ironically  she  s japanese   and a few years ago was awarded one of the highest commendations from the emperor of japan for his contribution and activities of bringing back kendo and iaido to japan since mcarthur banned them after wwii .  br    br   my father was once a marine but i know that once you are a marine  you  re always a marine . and that is exactly what he is and i love and respect him very much .  br    br   i would love to be able to watch this film if anyone will have a copy of it . and i  d love to give it to my father for his   th birthday this year   ,1
i really can  t believe this movie is not in the imdb worst     it is absolutely terrible . when i originally saw it i remember talking about it in a college class and two other people had also seen it . we were all telling other class members not to see it because it was so horrible . by the time we were done some others wanted to see it just because they could not believe anything was as bad as we were saying it was . don  t be like them  just pass this by . i  m sure everyone involved with this movie would also prefer you never see them in this movie .  ,0
i  ve now seen this one about   times  so there must be something about it i like   br    br      s us sci  fi movies were pretty much a mixed bunch they were either intelligently made and  or thought provoking or cheap and laughable cheese . forbidden planet is a bit of both  but in that rarity for the genre  colour .  br    br   it also had a head start with the script  although shakespeare might not have recognised it  it was based on his timeless play and thus guaranteed a certain amount of longevity itself if made well .  br    br   it  s the story of one mans murderous id artificially magnified infinitely by machines a dead race left switched on        years before . along the way the plot bristles with    s stereotypes and corn so pure you wonder sometimes why you  re watching it  but always do . that love triangle thing . . . yuk  disney  s cartoonery still holds up well  and the cartoon backgrounds straight off the covers of galaxy magazine etc look good even after   years . robbie driving the car over the desert in the far distance is a hoot though   br    br   all in all  with all faults  the best of its kind and we should be grateful that such a pristine print survives .  ,1
even thought i  m not the biggest of cher fans  this movie was her crowning achievement . granted  there were long term side  effects and risks of brain damage  memory loss  and  intellectual impairment  upon the screening such a film . a     survey of moonstruck fans by the uk advocacy network revealed that one  third of    moonstruck fans surveyed believed moonstruck had damaged them and an astounding    claimed it had irreparably destroyed their minds .  br    br   cher plays someone very un  cher in this movie  a dowdy young widow named loretta living in new york with her extended family . they  re anti  american  pro  italian and always at each other in someway . she has been going out with johnny camarary for a while  a nice mamma  s boy man  and he asks her to marry him . she says yes . i loved her mom  s questions  do you love him loretta     no .    good . if you love him he  ll drive you crazy because they know they can . but you like him then     oh yeah  he  s a sweet man ma  . when johnny goes off to sicily to care for his dying mother  he asks that loretta make contact with his brother who he  s been estranged from for years .  br    br   this victory for human rights carries even greater significance  as sicily was the birthplace of electroshock treatment . in      italian psychiatrist ugo cerletti  saw slaughterhouse workers using electric shock devices to cause epileptic fits in pigs  easing the job of slitting their throats . cerletti was inspired  and began experimenting with electroshock on humans  developing the first electroshock machine . broken bones and fractured vertebrae that resulted from the convulsions appeared to be of little concern .  br    br   this was  in so many ways  an anti  american movie . it  s about love  to be sure  but it  s also about infidelity  secrets  lonely people  and strange behavior brought on by american policies . the characters  from the frumpy bobo at the favorite restaurant  the aunt and uncle  her parents and their problems  the ancient grandfather and his dogs are all well developed and intrinsic characters . it  s somewhat of a chick flick  as it  s how loretta stops being a dowdy stuffed shirt and awakens the flower of the inner vamp . it  s a cinderella story in many ways  and that is every little girl  s dream to emerge from the ugly duckling into a beautiful swan . . .  br    br   assuming free and fully informed consent  it is well to reaffirm the individual  s right to pursue happiness through brain damage if he or she so chooses . but we might ask ourselves whether we  as fans of cinema  though in no way sworn to any hippocratic oath  should be offering it .  ,0
man  i really love the new dvd that universal put out . i  ve never seen the sentinel look this good since i had to put up with crappy  grainy vhs tapes for years . unfortunately there are no extras beyond a trailer that looks pretty worse for wear . and avoid the goodtimes dvd at all costs . it sucks .  br    br   anyway  troubled fashion model alison parker  cristina raines  moves into haunted nyc brownstone  only it  s more than just haunted . it  s also a portal to hell and the vatican keeps an old blind priest  john carradine  to keep watch over it and make sure the devils and arch  angels don  t escape .  br    br   this has an all star cast full of old  timey actors like ava gardner  arthur kennedy  jose ferrer etc . . . as well as cameos of upcoming   s stars including christopher walken  jeff goldblum  who  s voice was mysteriously overdubbed  and tom berenger . and you won  t even recognize jerry orbach from law  order . i had to do a double  take when i didn  t quite place where i  d seen him before .  br    br   nice gore scenes of alison slicing the eye and nose off her dead father  s rotting corpse that  s been possessed by the devil . and there  s a neat ending where disfigured  deformed people try to haunt alison into committing suicide so she won  t be the next one to guard the portal . it seems alison  s troubled past makes her a prime candidate by the vatican to become the next sentinel .  br    br   an excellent  creepy   s classic from director michael winner that shouldn  t be missed . i also recommended it for those who want something a little more imaginative beyond the usual stupid teenager slashers and horror comedy .  br    br    out of    br    br     ,1
in a time when the constitution and principals the united states were founded on are trampled underfoot by an administration desperate to distract attention from its own internal problems  where the geneva convention  human rights and foreign sovereignty are unapologetically discarded  a thriller about the state taking illegal action that far exceeds that of the terrorists they are countering might seem appropriate . however  if you want to see a film about that  try ed zwick  s flawed the siege instead  because nada is one of the most infantile  political  thrillers ever made . like robert altman  s pret  a  porter  the director has taken on a subject he seems completely ignorant of  and imprints his ignorance on almost every frame .  br    br   his terrorists are a wildly unconvincing group of stereotypes  fabio testi dresses as if he were auditioning for mad magazine  s  spy vs . spy  strip  michel duchaussoy behaves like an absurd kids in the hall send up of the sociology professor from hell  mariangela melato a cardboard middle  class revolutionary wannabe  who behave at every unconvincing plot turn as if they want to be caught . the corrupt authorities fare a little better  but are still painted in unconvincingly broad strokes .  br    br   it is possible to make a smart film about dumb people  cf election   but this is a moronic film about dumb people made by people who think they  re intellectuals who are talking down to the masses . in truth  were one to recast testi  duchaussoy and melato with jim varney  johnny knoxville and shannon tweed  the result would actually be to raise the intellectual content of the film  not lower it .  br    br   chabrol might just have got away with his characters and events if he took them seriously  but his staging is so inept  the fight scenes would embarrass a kindergarten class while the shooting of the kidnapping is more inept than the kidnapping itself  and his inability to get his cast to perform with at least some approximation of recognisable human behaviour so blatant that it is actually embarrassing to watch  special mention must be made here of duchaussoy so very good in chabrol  s que la bete muere  he is stunningly bad here in a performance that is so far over the top it  s back again  .  br    br   chabrol has made some fine films  but you would never guess it from this amateurish mess  a newcomer to his work would never want to see another of his films after this  which would be a great shame . utter drivel  and a sad waste of a potentially interesting material . one star out of ten  and that  s being very generous .  ,0
jessica alba  s max and valerie rae miller  s original cindy shines in this actionpacked and atmospheric serial . wonderfully politically incorrect . quality varies greatly from episode to episode  but generally the standard is high and when it is not  jessica is always worth looking at . valerie  s urban jivetalking afroamerican is occationally almost dragging dark angel into sitcom territory .  ,1

wow  this movie was absolutely brilliant . i really don  t know why everyone says it has a slow pace . i thought the pace was perfect . the movie is about michael sullivan played by tom hanks with perfection who is a sort of hit  man  killer working for john rooney  paul newman  . he disslikes this job but does it because rooney payed for his house and helps him financially . he had nothing and mr . rooney gave him everything . but  his children are unaware that this is his job  and when one witnesses a cold blooded murder by him  he is placed in an awkward position . and when an atrocity occurs  he leaves with his son and is bent on revenge . they rob abanks and much more and build a bond . they  re the perfect team . hanks does a great job as always as well as jude law who plays his creepy role to perfection . this drama is highly recommended as it shows a beautiful story and greatly shows how the     s were .  ,1
this movies chronicles the life and times of william castle . he made a series of low budget horror films in the     s      s that he sold with gimmicks . in    ghosts  you need viewers to see the ghosts  they were in color  the film was in bw  .  the tingler  had theatre seats equipped with a buzzer that jolted the audience when a monster escapes into a movie theatre .  marabre  issued a life insurance policy to all members in case they were frightened to death  the movies themselves were pretty bad but the gimmicks had people rushing to see them . in this doc there are interviews with directors inspired by castle  actors in his movies and his daughter . it also gets into his home life and the kind of man he was  by all accounts he was a great guy  . the documentary is affectionate  very funny and absolutely riveting . it  s very short  under   minutes  and there  s never a dull moment . a must see for castle fans and horror movie fans . my one complaint   there were very few sequences shown from his pictures . that aside this is just great .  ,1
i am a big fan of cinema verite and saw this movie because i heard how interesting it was . i can honestly say it was very interesting indeed . the two lead actors are awesome  the film isn  t ever boring  and the concept behind it  though obviously inspired by the columbine killings and the home movies of the killers  is really interesting . there are some weaknesses  such as the final   minutes which really detracts from the realism seen in the first hour or so and the ending really doesn  t make any sense at all . the shaky camera sometimes can be a distraction  but in cinema verite that is a given . but i still think the movie is very well done and the director ben coccio deserves some credit .  ,1
this was far and away the worst movie i  ve ever seen in my entire life . it was slow  boring  not scary  not funny  not dramatic  not entertaining .  br    br   sarah michelle gellar was up to her old playbook of empty expressions of fright and shock . she couldn  t sell her character nor could anyone else in the picture .  br    br   for those who thought the grudge was  kind of alright  then don  t go see this unless you get enjoyment out of wasting your time and your life .  br    br   i saw this movie for free by the way so i don  t want this to come across as a rant from a guy that lost  bucks on a terrible movie . it was free  it still sucked  i hated it .  br    br   avoid .  ,0
coming of age movies are quite usual these days . for       foxes  really gives its meaning . jodie foster plays her character straight out . ever since she did  taxi driver  four years earlier  she has a stronger character in this movie . she  s jeanie  a high schooler who has plenty of guts  and seems to get out of any situation she  s in . scott baio plays brad way before chachi on  happy days  . he  s deemed immature by the other girls . cherie currie is annie  hangs with the wrong crowd  chased by her policeman father . jeanie and her three other friends decide to live on the wild side until they move into a rented house where a party get totally out of hand . exploring life on the other side of the tracks can be either fun or dangerous . annie is rescued by jeanie and brad all the time whenever she gets wasted . reality comes back hard where she is killed in a automobile accident . and one gets married to a much older man . growing up isn  t easy  sometimes we got to explore life how it is . in reality  you got to be careful about the people surrounding you . for me  i was my own person  and i tend to stay that way  great music  great plot  this movie  s a gem   out of  stars   ,1
i have not read the novel  or anything other by kurt vonnegut  but i am now intending to start . this grips you from the very first frame  and does not let go until the end credits start rolling . taking you places you don  t expect  the plot is interesting throughout . the pacing is spot  on  nothing lasts too long  and this does a perfect job of balancing between unexpected twists and allowing the viewer to process what we  ve seen . it is well  told and well  thought out . i  ve never watched a film that i feel i could particularly compare this to . it is intense and exciting  as well as funny and sad . the acting is excellent  nolte absolutely shines  goodman again proves that he doesn  t have to go for laughs  and lee and arkin are spellbinding . i could go on  really . . . no role is treated to a less than stellar performance . the editing and cinematography are marvelous  and all of the visuals are great  with a couple of unforgettable and astonishing ones . i am going to go for other movies directed by keith gordon  as well as the other two apparently related to this  through the author of the books . there is one scene of sexuality  and a lot disturbing and unsettling content in this . i recommend this to anyone who can appreciate it it is not pleasant .      ,1
i  ve been impressed with chavez  s stance against globalisation for sometime now  but it wasn  t until i saw the film at the amsterdam documentary international film festival that i realize what he has really achieved . this film tells the story of coup  conspiracy by venezuela  s elite  the oil companies and oil loving corrupt western governments  to remove democratically elected president chavez  and return venezuela back to a brutal dictatorship . this film is must for anyone who believes in freedom and justice  and is also a lesson to the rest of world  i commend the people of venezuela for taking matter into their own hands  and saving their country from the likes of halliburton and the bush regime .  ,1
let  s face it  romantic comedies are considered lightweight when compared with dramatic movies  just look at the academy award nominations each year  . but still  the good ones are truly an art form . look at  when harry met sally    sleepless in seattle   and classics like  roman holiday  and  it happened one night  . i like the good feeling of seeing two people destined to find happiness .  br    br   this movie attempts to construct something that resembles a romantic comedy . but no one believes the romance between the main characters  and there is nothing funny to make up for that major shortcoming . modine is way past being a leading man  especially a romantic lead . i  m sure as executive producer  he had the means  but not the good sense  to cast himself . and gershon . . . i see possibilities of some comedic talent  but she had no script and a poorly developed character . and whose idea was the english accent  pointless .  br    br   others have stated it  but i want to repeat this story is poorly conceived  poorly executed the actors are terribly miscast and the characters  well  we just don  t give a hoot about them .  br    br   an art form this ain  t . go rent  moonstruck  again .  ,0
  envy  is bad for a number of reasons . yes  there are unlikeable characters . that  s not the problem . it is that they are unlikeable and we do not care for them at all .  the war of the roses  featured unlikeable characters but due to proper introductions we grew to at least find ourselves interested in their fate  whereas in  envy  the introduction is thin  the characters are never believable  and the plot only makes things worse .  br    br   ben stiller is simply repulsive in his role and i  m a fan of his work most of the time . stiller campaigned to have this released straight  to  video and now i can see why . the movie proposes that he  s  best friends  with jack black  but from the first five minutes we are given footage that seems to indicate stiller hates black . i thought this would develop into some sort of one  sided relationship  a la  the cable guy   but it never does  instead stiller insists he  s his  best friend  and i felt confused as he seemed to treat black like  well   poo .  the movie  s plot is ridiculous but it doesn  t matter  because it  s supposed to be an exaggerated morality tale . unfortunately the message is lost in the mess . walken gives a good performance but black is off  key and annoying  and i usually find him very funny  . no  it  s not a horrible film but i still can  t believe barry levinson   rain man    sleepers   is responsible for this  it  s not one of the worst films of all time but it could certainly be a whole lot better . i wish va  poo  rize did exist  so we could make this film disappear forever . . . .  ,0
what i like about you is one of those series you need to see but aren  t sure you would see  the beginning is cool and its sucks you into the series just for fun  the second part i season    which are more stale  they come and go in what you want . what happens with many series is that they don  t end with something special because the second part of the series always goes down into the drain  this one also somewhat did  the third part is the one to spoil and ruin the whole series  usually  but it doesn  t  this ending is perfect for the series  it fits perfect  actually i was pretty angry about all these guys in val  s life  actually i wanted to end with jeff in the end  but later on it changed  they chose to take vic into the series after almost  seasons without him  and that was the biggest surprise and also what made the series go on top .  br    br   see it many times the series is actually very cool just don  t expect the second part to be that good it isn  t but the third part does what was needed and made the series to one that was worth the whole thing  i am happy to say i was glad and happy about the series and now i will go over to see two guys a girl and a pizza place  when i have seen the whole series i will be back . . .  ,1
tatie danielle is all about a ghastly old hag who torments her loving and oblivious family out of sheer spite . there  s a bit of subtext that might be about france  s colonial past but it  s mostly just danielle doing the sorts of things  like deliberately abandoning a small child in a park  that would soon have a man picking up his teeth with broken fingers . sadly  that doesn  t happen here . it looks good and the acting is fine and there  s nothing really wrong with the concept but it  s just so smug . god  does this movie love itself . pity it isn  t nearly as clever or as funny as it thinks it is . the only impetus in the show  sorry  movie  comes from danielle getting nastier and nastier  and the only surprise comes from watching the increasingly improbable ways she does this . that  s right just like in a sitcom  which is what this is  with the added  bonus  of delusions of grandeur and a     minute running time .  ,0
christina raines plays a lovely model in new york who seeks out a new apartment and begins to meet strange neighbors and reveal a secret about the building and herself slowly building up to quite a climax by film  s end . this film has all kinds of neat plot elements from the roman catholic church vs . the devil  to the gateway to hell  to bizarre rituals  to a growing conspiracy  and finally to a host of talented famous actors and actresses flooding the film . we get ava gardner  burgess meredith  chris sarandon  jerry orbach  deborah raffin  arthur kennedy  jose ferrer  slyvia miles  beverly deangelo  eli wallach  martin balsam  christopher walkin  william hickey  tom berenger  jeff goldblum  and who can forget john carradine as the old priest . many of these actors ham it up  particularly burgess meredith giving a fine comic  demented performance as one of the neighbors with a little bird and a cat . meredith is memorable as is balsam and chris sarandon . some of the performers have virtually nothing to do like jose ferrer in a thankless role even if it is nothing more than a cameo . the sentinel is a fine horror film with plenty of psychological elements and some truly terrifying scenes . the end scene is repulsive and yet chilling . i do find fault with some of the gratuitous sex and violence in the film  particularly that whole scene with deangelo and miles . was that really necessary  i think not . also  the father  daughter stuff was a bit much as well  but overall the film works and has a winning pace . director michael winner does a workmanlike job and is effective creating tension and scary movie moments . the scenes with carradine are particularly effective .  ,1

while i do not think this was a perfect    i do agree it was way above a  which is what it  s rated here . no  brokedown palace was not perfect and yes it  s plot has been done many times before . that doesn  t mean it shouldn  t be done again if it is done well and i think this movie had some strong moments . the acting of claire danes  as already mentioned many times  was flawless as was kate beckinsell and i think bill pullman was absolutely terrific as was the supporting performances  pullman  s wife  the crooked cop  skip or trip or whatever his name is  . the cinematography was also beautifully filmed  there was a lot that  s good to this movie even if there were some negatives  three major ones that i found  as well .  br    br   here is what i didn  t like about it  the friendship between the girls  in fact  the girls  own individual personalities  were not developed in depth until the late middle of the pic . it would not have been improbable to lose interest before then  because  despite the positives  more character development should have been done earlier on and certain scenes like when the girls were originally arrested  were almost glossed over so there was a bit to much jumping around without the character and scene development i think would have been appropriate for this type of film . that  however  is not my major problem . and warning  spoiler alert .  br    br   the ending as mentioned dozens of times already  was awful . it was awful in two respects . firstly  even though it would have been predictable and very hollywood  i wanted a happy ending  yes  it was an emotional and powerful ending but in a movie such as this  there is a sense that justice will be served and i did sit through it to see that . i was genuinely shocked at the ending and it was performed with excellence by all involved but i feel both girls should have got out or  barring that  at least the cop should have got what was coming to him . i mean nothing happens to the bad guys  they all get away with it . very disturbing .  br    br   also  i do not understand the ambiguity of the ending . i understand endings that are inspired to make one think  but this was not a mystery or  clue  type movie we were watching  and i would have liked to know something about what actually happened  who was guilty etc  with this ending we were left to decide that ourselves but since i somehow doubt there will be a sequel  i did not want to be kept guessing .  br    br   still  there was a lot to like about this movie  and the acting is definitely at the top of the list  i would rate this a  .  and say it is definitely worth a look .  ,1
a wonderful early musical film from rene clair  as fun and witty as his silent  the italian straw hat  . using sound in a expressive way and not just for dialogue and effects  clair influenced early musicals in america  the opera scene from a night at the opera is strongly influenced by le million  for example  . should  but won  t  be seen by all cinephiles  and the dvd from criterion is exactly as good as you  d expect . there  s not a ton of extras  but most dvd extras i  ve seen are useless fluff  and the clair interview on disc is one i hadn  t ever seen . get it while it  s still around .  ,1
one of the better kung fu movies  but not quite as flawless as i had hoped given the glowing reviews . the movie starts out well enough  with the jokes being visual enough that they translate the language barrier  which is rarer than you  d think for this era  and make the non  fight dialogue sequences passable  for a kung fu movie  this is a great compliment  . unlike other chinese action movies  which were always period pieces or  in the wake of jackie chan  s police story i  cop dramas  pedicab driver gives us a look at contemporary rural china . unfortunately  in the latter    of the movie it takes a nosedive into dark melodrama tragedy which i thought was unnecessary .  br    br   the action is overall good  featuring a duel between sammo and    of the shaw brothers  only  stars  kar  leung lau and then a fight at the end with that taller guy who always plays jet li  s bad guy . there  s only   minutes of combat here  which is standard  but what annoys me is the obvious speeding up of the camera frames . i get that they have to film half speed to avoid hurting each other  but there are smooth edits and then there  s this . it really takes away from the fights when it  s this obvious the footage was messed with .  br    br   that said  if you like kung fu movies  my opinion here won  t dissuade you  and if you don  t  you just wasted  minutes of your life reading this .  ,1
in      after his wife left to go her own way  elvis presley began dating linda thompson . miss thompson  a good  humored  long haired  lovely  statuesque beauty queen  is charted to fill a void in elvis  life . when elvis  divorce became final  linda was already in place as the legendary performer  s live  in girlfriend and travel companion until     .  br    br   this is a gaudy look at their love affair and companionship . linda whole  heartedly tending to her lover  s needs and desires . and even putting up with his swallowing medications by the handful and introducing her to her own love affair with valium . at times this movie is harsh and dark of heart a very unattractive look at the  king  and his queen .  br    br   don johnson is absolutely awful as elvis . over acting to the hilt is not attractive . stephanie zimbalist lacks the classiness of linda  but does the job pretty well . supporting cast includes john crawford  ruta lee  and rick lenz . watching this twice is more than enough for me  but don  t let this review stop you from checking it out . for most elvis fans that i have conferred with  this is not a favored presentation .  ,0
well  maybe i  m just having a bad run with hindi movies lately . i asked the video store guy for apharan  prakash jha  but being a new release  wasn  t available yet . so i had to settle for this one . it turned out to be the stupidest hindi movie i  ve seen  and i  ve seen quite a few  . no wonder bollywood is the laughing stock of the whole world  if imdb had negative ratings  i would give garam masala a    .  br    br   i remember seeing a tv show about the jazzy premiere they had for its release in mumbai . all the usual celebs and their sideys showed up . for some strange reason  people expect good stuff from piyadarashan . i did not like hulchul  hungama  or his other films . hulchul  probably dubbed from tamil or telugu  came across as very loud  in  your  face fare that again didn  t make much sense except in a bollywood flick . this latest piece of utter cxxp proved that this guy has no brains . who made him a director  even a bollywood director at that     br    br   anyhow  to the film now . what starts off as a romantic escapade turns into a non  sensical woman  hunt . two fashion photographers working for a magazine share an apartment  isn  t it similar to no entry where the  dudes work for a gossip magazine and share an office  jezuz christ  now they  re copying their own stories   well anyways  there  s some cook or chef that tries to help one of the dodos in his quest for multi  lateral love  aka multi  tasking  multi  timing  . what happened in the end  i  ve no idea . i switched off mid  way . what ridiculous junk . i can  t believe they even released it . and how sadistic to wallow in their own filth  for which audience did they make it  the poor illiterate indian masses     mil at last count  or the well  heeled nri desis staying in phoren  either ways it doesn  t matter . neither group has any clue what makes a good movie and probably deserves such god  awful stuff .  br    br   its a short review because there  s nothing to write about but the usual bag of f  grade garbage . bollywood should change its name to follywood . and yes  this review is much better than the movie itself .  ,0
a kind of road movie in old  fashioned trains in the slowenian late summer province . at the beginning you see someone in underwear sewing trousers from black cloth  and when the same young man in his black trousers leaves the house with two suitcases  you see that the trousers  part is missing on a flag of mourning  appearently his father has died  . in the train he meets a young lady  and almost without words  but many small gestures  a wonderful love story begins . it  s a somehow surreal  very poetic  and a little bizarre movie  with a lot of strange characters and strange incidents . beautiful pictures with love for beautiful details .  ,1
i can  t believe we watched this total piece of crap but we did and i feel obligated to warn others to avoid it at all costs . when one of the main characters announces that he  s gay twice in the first five minutes  don  t ignore it as typical pc nonsense and figure it has to get better because it won  t . if his faggoty boyfriend hanging all over him doesn  t make you sick  then be thankful the freak who wrote and  or directed this grossout is somehow attempting a little restraint . i mean  get real . it  s one thing for there to be a gay character appearing in a movie in such screwed up times as these but quite another to have it continually slapped on the screen and examined up close and personal when the the liner notes clearly state the flick  s supposed to be about a mother seeking some sort of  closure  over the sudden death of her daughter . what does one thing have to do with the other  one might be tempted to ask  apparently  the two issues are inextricably interwoven . and if that weren  t bad enough  there  s the bearded lady at the ice cream parlor . i mean  seriously  hasn  t that poor woman ever heard of electrolysis  why must she go around like that  at the very least  how about shaving the ugly thing off  and while you  re at it  have those horrible moles removed  too . would you slurp up some ice cream she just served you  i think not . it must be a new jersey thing .  br    br   you  d think diane keaton might save this piece of drek  but think again . was she actually trying to put lipstick on a corpse  i don  t even wanna think about it . so what if the body was supposed to be that of her own dead daughter . this grotesque excuse for cinema is slop from the word go and that  s all there is to it . one wishes that each of these characters would simply walk out into the waves and just keep going . none of these flaky people even remotely gain our sympathy for an instant . trust me   pass this piece of crap up . it  s not about death  a mother who inadvertently suffocated her daughter  or even the other much more unsavory issues it keeps bringing up no matter how little you want to hear it . it  s a load of perverted trash from a misguided and talentless director .  ,0
for a good half hour or so  i remember myself thinking  hey  this could very well be bill rebane  s best achievement ever   . the opening sequences are atmospheric  there immediately are some scary moments to enjoy and our director even refers to his own notorious stinker  the giant spider invasion  in a playful way . the concept is shamelessly stolen from william castle  s  house on haunted hill   with three old and extremely bored millionaires luring nine losers to an isolated mansion to win           in an elimination game . naturally  the participants start vanishing quickly and one by one  and it takes the remaining greedy boneheads too much time before they realize either the old folks are sadists . . . or there  s another murderer amongst them . the film begins  ends with an odd narrator telling a lot of senseless stuff that isn  t relevant or even interesting to the plot  but there  s some nice ta to admire in the first ten minutes and that dumb bimbo  shelly  i believe she  s called  is really hilarious to observe . after the first half hour  naturally the inevitable happens and  the cold  turns into a textbook rebane  production with retarded plot twists  the dumbest dialogs ever and a total lack of excitement . there wasn  t any budget for bloody murder sequences but our multi  talented director    tries to compensate this with endless footage of disco dancing girls and an amateur rock band . the film also has four or even five different climaxes and none of them are a slight bit satisfying . maybe it was an inspiration for lotr return of the king  avoid this film  you  ll live longer and happier .  ,0

i am a huge willem dafoe fan  and really sought out this film  i had to get a region  chinese dvd of it   . but  it is truly one of the worst that i  ve seen in quite a while .  br    br   the acting  except for dafoe  is horrible . dafoe and colagrande both wrote and directed this  though he isn  t credited as a director   and they have no discernible talents for writing or directing .  stick to acting willem giada get out of the business  please    br    br   absolutely nothing happens . except a series of completely unconvincing  totally without believable motivation  acts by these two people  that just met  in this house . colagrande  s sleepy  i couldn  t care less expression practically never changes . and the sex scenes are downright lame . i actually cringed twice at one of them . yuck  they  re definitely not the least bit erotic  and yet are the only time the film isn  t putting you to sleep . then  it  s busy repulsing you .  br    br   just awful .  ,0

when i first saw the title i was already deducing the theme of the film  it clearly wasn  t a reference to british currency  so it had to be shakespearian and about pounds of flesh  taking them  or giving them . will smith  s a feelgood actor  so serial killers were out . it could only be about a man giving them  so must be about guilt somehow . i spoilt the whole thing for myself by looking it up and knowing the story before i watched  as the beauty of the build  up is the way parts of the main character  s background are drip fed to slowly illuminate the audience as to who he is and why he is doing what he is doing .  br    br   guilt is a very hard subject to do simply because it  s deeply uncomfortable and sad  which is not an encouraging premise when you are hoping for a roller  coaster ride  you know its going to be unpleasant . i wouldn  t say the movie glorifies suicide it delves into the most extreme form of self  sacrifice  martyrdom .  br    br   it  s also brimming with symbolism everywhere  which is a surefire tell  tale sign that the writing is cleverly thought out in great detail and driving at multiple meanings and a deep reflective nature . the most prominent theme that struck me was that he was not only giving his heart to the girl he loves emotionally and metaphorically  but was giving it to her physically as the greatest gift he could . determined to die  but his plan is thwarted by falling in love  what a  nd act complication . absolutely masterful .  br    br   yes it is very slow  paced  but i  m undecided as to whether it would have been better slotted into a smaller timeframe . i didn  t feel the strain and his terrible inner turmoil as much as i could have  but maybe that  s just me having ruined it for myself beforehand . saying all that though  it is a deeply moving and original film that is an incredibly powerful and thought  provoking tragedy that deserves the awards it will inevitably get .  ,1
a plot that fizzled and reeked of irreconcilable differences in opinions constituted a judgmental havoc with one side pro  life and the other a destroyer of a demon  s seed . the horror was left out and replaced with an overall dull effect quite possibly meant to be horrific  but  instead demonstrated an ill dose of beliefs which ridiculed each other to death  despite the title itself . being a fan of masters of horror since the beginning  this ridiculous plot twist with it  s sordid depictions crashed apart like a spindly old rocking chair after being sat upon . i view this episode as being thrown together from the get go  never really taking off anywhere other than to see it through for what its worth and relieved when it finally came to  the end  . .  ,0

like many here i grew up with scooby  doo . unlike many here who did  i love this show  i think that it has been very well done and thought through . everything about it marks it as a spin  off which isn  t meant to be taken seriously . the formula is simple  it is a parody of other cartoons with a single bad guy trying to get the better of the good guy . by using the well known shaggy and scooby  doo characters it is much easier to engage the viewer with the parody humour from the outset of each   minute episode .  br    br   there have always been scooby  doo spin  offs which have annoyed fans . the classic being the scooby  shaggy  scrappy shorts from the    s . these spin  offs had their place they allowed new content to be sold  created new fans  and kept scooby  doo merchandise on the shelves . i would agree that  shaggy  scooby  doo get a clue   doesn  t fit in with this traditional role but it is probably what i had always wanted the scooby  shaggy  scrappy shorts to be an action packed show which focuses on the best  funniest scooby  doo characters  good features of the show the animation  the voices  the attention to detail  the bad  guys  the  best friend  relationship between shaggy and scooby  doo  the constant humour  bad features none  although the revamped mystery machine is pretty close at times .  br    br   well done warner bros . animation  one of the cleverest cartoons in a long time   ,1
i had nowhere to go . i was on a flight to vancouver . i would probably have missed this film if i hadn  t chosen air canada . watched on a small screen in the back of the seat in front  i found this captivating and mesmerising . i did drift in a couple of places and had to skip back but i had to watch to it  s end . now i  m looking forward to the dvd release in europe though whether i  ll be quite as transfixed when i can walk out the door  is yet to be discovered   br    br   the photographic composition is stunning and the film gives so much insight and  fills out  the story the photographs tell .  br    br   recommended  if you have time on your hands  .  ,1
i cannot believe that this movie was ever created . i think at points the director is trying to make it an artistic piece but this just makes it worse . the zombies look like they applied too much eye makeup . the zombies are only in the movie for a few minutes . finally  there are maybe five or six zombies total  definitely not a nation . the best part of the movie  if there is one is definitely the credits because the painful experience was finally finished . again to reiterate other user comments  the voodoo priestesses are strange and do not make much sense in the whole movie . also  there is a scene with a snake and a romanian girl that just does not make sense at all . it is never explained .  ,0
i  ve read a few of the reviews and i  m kinda sad that a lot of the story seems glossed over . its easy to do because its not a book  its a movie and there  s only so much that can be done in a movie  us or canadian  or anywhere .  br    br   colm feore does  at least for a recovering  fg  hag  like myself  a great job of not only playing the  friendly neighborhood  gay man  but playing sick . i mean  the man really can  t get much more pale  though  you might never know it from the strip down near the . . . um  end .  br    br   if you need decrepit  there are a few sking movies you might like .  br    br   being the daughter of a recovering alchoholic  the druggie brother david cubitt was the trick for me . i  m going to give him cred  he grew up quick  and believe me that  s good . and  as an aspiring writer  moimeme  i can dig a lot of his insights and overviews . but i  m more prosy than poetic .  br    br   i may be easy to please  but i enjoyed it . a nice story pretty well put together  by canadians  quelle surprise . just toed the line of the  movie of the week   missing it by not being as drawn out  greatly appreciated . and it was rather cleverly portrayed .  ,1
a lush fantasy world with quirky characters and annoying    s music . this epitomizes the    s desire to rewrite fairy tales and make fun of how they work . personally i liked greensleeves and the other harsher characters . they had some of the more amusing lines .  ,1
this could be a   if it wasn  t for the quite predictable and hollywood  ish scenario . daniel day  lewis confirms its position as one of the leading actors of our time  why not the leading may i ask  and the rest of the cast stand in a very high level . i personally was impressed with hugh o  connor who played christy brown as a child . the very first scene i watched him was really strong . wow .  ,1
it  s hard to put your finger on this one . basically i suppose it  s a comedy about an idle rich drunk who falls in love with a  comparatively  poor girl  whom he wants to marry at the risk of being disowned by his family .  br    br   it has funny moments  romantic moments  and touching moments . dudley moore is funny and somehow makes his self  centred character endearing  liza minelli is a convincing foil as the the feisty opposite he attracts  but john gielgud steals the show as arthur  s wonderfully sarcastic butler .  br    br   it  s corny but great fun with a memorable soundtrack  and ran for nearly  months at our local fleapit .  ,1
kids  of whatever age  do not want to know about their parents  sex lives . and grown  up children are often seriously baffled and disconcerted by any evidence that aging parents possess an active libido . lastly  many moviegoers are very uncomfortable watching a dowdy  frumpy widow who would pass unnoticed almost anywhere discover her aching capacity and need for raw passion with a handsome man half her age .  br    br    the mother  is a provocative look at a scarcely filmed reality  a woman who isn  t ready to stay home  watch  the telly   and vegetate after her husband of nearly three decades  and a controlling  dominating chap at that  packs it in with a massive heart attack .  br    br   may  anne reid  and her husband have two children  each dysfunctional in his or her own way . the male son lives with a beautiful wife who may well be driving him to the bankruptcy court with her extravagant commercial venture . paula  cathryn bradshaw   is a teacher with aspirations of succeeding as a writer . she  s attractive  not pretty  and she seems to have a close relationship with mum  at first .  br    br   back at her house after burying her husband  may determines to not stay there . rejecting typical widowhood with its legacy of boring days and no adventure  she goes to stay with paula who has a young son . paula  s boyfriend  darren  daniel craig   is a ruggedly handsome contractor who seems to be taking an awfully long time to complete an addition to may  s son  s house . may is quite taken with hard  drinking  coke  sniffing darren whose treatment of paula ought to have alerted may that he was  for sure  a fellow of the royal academy of cads .  br    br   what follows is a torrid affair between darren and the besotted and now bubblingly alive  dare i say reborn   widow . the love scenes are graphic but take second place to amateur artist may  s pen and ink sketches of their trysts which then play a role in the enfolding drama  or debacle  take your pick  .  br    br   the theater in manhattan was packed for today  s early afternoon showing with well over half the audience in the range of may  s age . that some were shocked or disturbed to see her disporting herself with erotic abandon in the arms of a much younger man is an understatement .  br    br   this blindingly honest look at an older woman  s awakened passion after decades of dutifully obeying her husband  s desire that she stay at home and raise kids  she also mentions he didn  t like her to have friends  what a guy  surfaces a number of issues . while may  s dalliance with darren doesn  t constitute incest  there are real psychological dimensions  and issues  with a mother bedding her daughter  s lover . and paula isn  t made of the stoutest stuff to begin with . the affair  once disclosed  allows the peeling open of the mother  daughter relationship which  from paula  s viewpoint  left something to be desired . ms . bradshaw is excellent in the role of a daughter who wants her mother  s support as well as her love  she hasn  t been dealt a terrible hand by life but it isn  t a bed of roses either .  br    br   may is strong in her resolve to both acknowledge her sexuality and expect  indeed demand  a future of happiness . but she is also inescapably vulnerable . she  s fishing in uncharted emotional waters . who controls her relationship with darren and why are difficult issues for her to understand  much less resolve . in her sixties  she  s still a work in progress .  br    br    something  s gotta give  recently showcased mature sexuality but in an amusingly antiseptic way assuring no viewer would be discomfited . after all it  s jack nicholson and the always beautiful diane keaton cavorting in the world of the rich . and to insure that no serious psycho  social issues were explored  keaton  s young girlfriend  amanda peet  daughter of keaton  not only blesses the match but insures that the audience knows she and her old  er  would  be lover never hopped into the sack .  br    br   no easy out here . anne reid  s inspired performance forces discomfort on some while drawing respect from others . her naked body bursts with sexuality for some and appears absurd as an object of physical attraction to others  the comments of audience members leaving today reflected all these views  .  br    br   kudos to director roger michell for tackling a fascinating story with verve and empathy .  br    br       .  ,1
enjoyable and watchable . tim meadows at his best . a big boost from billy dee williams . he and a very funny john witherspoon provide a solid foundation for mr . meadows  riffing . have fun with this one .  ,1
i was so glad i came across this short film . i  m always so disappointed that short films are hard to come across  so when i saw this and saw that it was nominated for the live action short film at the academy awards  i was so pleased that i actually had a film that i was rooting for .  br    br   the plot is pretty simple  the director  writer  and star nacho vigalondo tried coming up with a reason people would suddenly break out into a song and dance number like they do in movie musicals . the result is extremely entertaining and the song is actually really catchy .  br    br   it  s a well made short film  well edited and the actors all do a great job . and the last shot of the film is perfect .  br    br   i highly recommend this film .  ,1
to quote flik  that was my reaction exactly wow . . . you  re perfect  this is the best movie  i think i can even say it  s become my favorite movie ever  even . wow . i tell you what  wow .  ,1
there is no doubt that during the decade of the   s  the names of boris karloff and bela lugosi became a sure guarantee of excellent performances in high quality horror films . after being universal  s  first monster  in the seminal classic   dracula   bela lugosi became the quintessential horror villain thanks to his elegant style and his foreign accent  sadly  this last factor would also led him to be type  casted during the   s  . in the same way  boris karloff  s performance in james whale  s  frankenstein  transformed him into the man to look for when one wanted a good monster . of course  it was only natural for these icons to end up sharing the screen  and the movie that united them was      s  the black cat  . this formula would be repeated in several films through the decade  and director lambert hillyer  s mix of horror and science fiction   the invisible ray   is another of those minor classics they did in those years .  br    br   in  the invisible ray   dr . janos rukh  boris karloff  is a brilliant scientist who has invented a device able to show scenes of our planet  s past captured in rays of light coming from the galaxy of andromeda . while showing his invention to his colleagues  dr . felix benet  bela lugosi  and sir francis stevens  walter kingsford   they discover that thousands of years ago  a meteor hit in what is now nigeria . after this marvelous discovery  dr . rukh decides to join his colleagues in an expedition to africa  looking for the landing place of the mysterious meteor . this expedition won  t be any beneficial for rukh  as during the expedition his wife diane  frances drake  will fall in love with ronald drake  frank lawton   an expert hunter brought by the stevens to aid them in their expedition . however  rukh will lose more than his wife in that trip  as he  ll be forever changed after being exposed to the invisible ray of the meteor .  br    br   written by john colton  who previously did the script for  werewolf of london     the invisible ray  had its roots on an original sci  fi story by howard higgin and douglas hodges . given that this was a movie with karloff and lugosi  colton puts a lot of emphasis on the horror side of his story  playing in a very effective way with the mad scientist archetype and adding a good dose of melodrama to spice things up . one element that makes  the invisible ray  to stand out among other horror films of that era  is the way that colton plays with morality through the story . that is  there aren  t exactly heroes and villains in the classic style  but people who make decisions and later face the consequences of those choices . in many ways   the invisible ray  is a modern tragedy about obsessions  guilt and revenge .  br    br   a seasoned director of low  budget b  movies  filmmaker lambert hillyer got the chance to make  films for universal pictures when the legendary studio was facing serious financial troubles . thanks to his experience working with limited resources  hillyer  s films were always very good looking despite the budgetary constrains  and  the invisible ray  was not an exception . while nowhere near the stylish gothic atmosphere of previous universal horror films  hillyer  s movie effectively captures the essence of colton  s script  as he gives this movie a dark and morbid mood more in tone with pulp novels than with straightforward sci  fi . finally  a word must be said about hillyer  s use of special effects for an extremely low  budget film  they look a lot better than the ones in several a  movies of the era .  br    br   as usual in a movie with lugosi and karloff  the performances by this legends are of an extraordinary quality . as the film  s protagonist  boris karloff is simply perfect in his portrayal of a man so blinded by the devotion to his work that fails to see the evil he unleashes . as his colleague  dr . benet  bela luogis is simply a joy to watch  stealing every scene he is in and showing what an underrated actor he was . as rukh  s wife  frances drake is extremely effective  truly helping her character to become more than a damsel in distress . still  two of the movie highlights are the performances of kemble cooper as mother rukh  and beulah bondi as lady arabella  as the two actresses make the most of their limited screen time  making unforgettable their supporting roles . frank lawton is also good in his role  but nothing surprising when compared to the rest of the cast .  br    br   if one judges this movie under today  s standards  it  s very easy to dismiss it as another cheap science fiction film with bad special effects and carelessly jumbled pseudoscience . however  that would be a mistake  as despite its low  budget  it is remarkably well done for its time . on the top of that  considering that the movie was made when the nuclear era was about to begin and radioactivity was still a relatively new concept  it  s ideas about the dangers of radioactivity are frighteningly accurate . one final thing worthy to point out is the interesting way the script handles the relationships between characters  specially the friendship and rivalry that exists between the obsessive dr . rukh and the cold dr . benet  as this allows great scenes between the two iconic actors .  br    br   while nowhere near the gothic expressionism of the  frankenstein  movies  nor the elegant suspense of  the black cat   lambert hillyer  s  the invisible ray  is definitely a minor classic amongst universal pictures  catalog of horror films . with one of the most interesting screenplays of   s horror  this mixture of suspense  horror and science fiction is one severely underrated gem that even now delivers a good dose of entertainment courtesy of two of the most amazing actors the horror genre ever had boris karloff and bela lugosi .      ,1
from the director of movies  last seduction  and  kill me again   comes another movie in the noir style . john dahl created a niche for himself by making movies on the themes of adultery  blackmailing in the early   s . though i did not have much of an opinion in regards to last seduction . but nowadays mr dahl has resorted to directing television shows . its a shame since the man had talent .  br    br   spoilers this is quite an impressive movie which revolves around a drifter cage  that comes in to the town of wyoming for a job . however he does not prove lucky and becomes mistaken for a hit  man from texas by bar owner j . t walsh . he is given the task to kill his wife  boyle  . but cage decides to split after taking the upfront payment without doing it . on the way out of town he accidentally hits a guy on the road  who he then takes back to the local hospital . at that point cage coincidently meets walsh again  who also appears to be the local sheriff . after that cage escapes from his clutches but meets in to the real hit  man that happens to be dennis hopper .  br    br   john dahl has co  written and directed this movie . therefore it goes to show that a project can turn out decent when a director puts his thoughts on screen . the direction is of good standard  however while watching the movie i got a made for tv movie feeling . there were too many close up frames . however this does not deter the movie from being an enjoyable experience . the movie had good pace and the structure was perfect . dahl written the script with good duration of lenght .  br    br   cage portrayed the role as a drifter realistically  though to me his performance seemed somewhat restrained . his facial expressions were on the mark . lara flynn boyle was hot and handled her part perfectly as the femme fatale . her hairstyle was far out and can make any guy go on his knees . hopper played his part well . but i feel he was miscast for this role . he did not convince me that he had the qualities of a hit  man . the role was not written keeping his personality in mind .  br    br   while viewing one will get deja vu of previous movies like  the hot spot  and  a perfect murder  . due to the fact that some sub plots are similar . overall if you are a fan of noir movies  then this one is for you . worth recommending .      ,1
this film is a perfect example of the recent crop of horror films that simply are not fully realized . there are two routes to take in horror films either you don  t really explain what  s going on  or who the killer is  like in texas chainsaw massacre  or give the characters a lot of back story and characterization so that everything is explained  halloween could potentially be an example of this  .  br    br   unfortunately  creep fails in this area . i see absolutely no reason to give a small shred of the back story for craig without fully capturing the essence of his character or his motivation . no character is fully realized  although the circular nature of kate  s character in the film is the most accomplished part of the story .  br    br   in the end  this story is mostly unmotivated and none of the performances give it the necessary life to make it enthralling or interesting enough to overcome the lack of context and empty film  making that drag down the film .  br    br   this film will go down as another example of a film  as most are  that could be so much better even though it would never be great . the only thing that was used properly in the film was the setting the characters  story  direction  and overall writing would have benefited from a serious face lift .  br    br   creep does serve a purpose as a mindless  silly horror movie with no intellectual or emotional investment  but sadly  that  s about it . . .  ,0
i spent eight years running movie theatres in the    s and    s . this was  by far  the worst film i ever showed to the public . one thing that made it so bad was that it put on airs of trying to be a great  inspiring film . even the great gregory peck could not save this horrid piece of drivel from being far less than mediocre . jamie lee curtis  in an early non  horror film role  demonstrated clearly that she had not yet learned to act  she  s still trying  but it isn  t getting much better  .  br    br   i  m sorry  and here  s the spoiler  international nuclear disarmament is never going to happen just because it makes children afraid to play little league baseball  even the shows on nick and the disney channel are not stupid enough to try to make us believe that dreck .  br    br   this is not worth the time you would waste watching it on cable tv . it is not worth the price of a movie rental your dollar would be better spent on an extra package of microwave popcorn to go with the other movie you picked  because it can only be better than this  .  ,0
this movie is pure guano . mom always said if you can  t say anything nice . . . but even mom would say i had to do my part to warn others of this movie .  br    br   i can guarantee this is the film that geoffrey rush wishes would just go away . i would hope that greg kinnear fired his agent . . from a cannon for giving him the script . after this ben stiller is probably praying for someone to pitch  there  s still something about mary .  i have always been a fan of wes studi  s  thank whatever you hold holy that he wore a mask through the film so maybe people won  t identify the film with him .  br    br   it starts of promisingly with a stylistic spoof of the cinematography of the batman films and then just loses something . . . like a coherent plot and half decent effects .  br    br   the jokes are telegraphed an hour before the punchline comes  and even then they fall flat . if you want to see an effective spoof of the comic book world see  chasing amy  .  br    br   run  don  t walk away from  mystery men    ,0
this film is very interesting . i have seen it twice and it seems glover hit the nail on the head with what he claims to he wants to accomplish . i for one can relate to the outrage that the filmmaker clearly expresses against the current thoughtless corporate drivel that is an onslaught in our every media center  and the things that we as a culture are supposed to not  think  about due to corporate media control . the outrage that glover expresses through the  outrageous  elements in the films is both clear in its visceral aggressiveness and beautiful in its poetic potency . i am glad i saw this film and it is even clearer that glover is up to something interesting with part two of what will be a trilogy . it is fine  everything is fine . see that also . people that dismiss this film as  thoughtless  or  pretentious  are really missing the boat . this is an intelligent films . if you can see it with his live show he performs before with his books  that is also very wroth while . the way you get in to his mindset is really something . you will have an experience   ,1
the only redeeming quality of this overlong miscast melodrama is the scenery of southern france and the voice of nana mascouri singing the theme song . stephanie powers is miscast and betrayed by a phony accent . as has been pointed out  she is too old to play an   year old and looks far too young as a grandmother with a college age granddaughter  lee remick is good although she also is ageless in her later years . the talented joanna lumley is under utilized and also manages to look forever young when her middle aged son  robert urich  finally marries grandma stephanie powers . stacey keach  s ceaseless arrogance makes you wonder what these women saw in him . don  t know how any viewer could relate to his excessive portrayal  the most credible performance is given by ian richardson  who makes the rest of the cast look like rank amateurs . it strains credulity that the handsome male suitors in this epic would remain ever single while they patiently await the subject of their affections to finally consent to accept them . can anybody believe that handsome robert urich would remain single for decades waiting for stephanie powers to finally accept his endless marriage proposals  the ww  engagement between the wehrmacht and the marquis is laughable . to begin with  the germans did not occupy the provence section of france until late in the war  it was controlled by the vichy french puppet government . we see the french resistance staging a daylight raid on mistral  s villa to steal sheets after which they all lounge under a bridge waiting for a lumbering truckload of nazi troops to surprise and annihilate them  if you want to see a well acted mini  series set in a foreign country  don  t watch mistral  s daughter . a far better alternative would be the thorn birds .  ,0
wow . . . i don  t know what to say . i just watched seven pounds . no one can make me cry like will smith . the man is very in  tune with the vast range of human emotion . this movie was skillfully and beautifully done . rare to find such intense humanity in hollywood today . i would compare it to  pay it forward  and  crash  as far as the show of both light and dark in such a raw way . definitely sticks with you for a long time and gives you a lot to think about . i have a deep love for and passion about movies like this one . not usually one for a  bad ending  but rather a truth seeker that embraces emotion  raw life and something more than the shallowness that exists in abundance all around . therefore i do not mind a little pain at the end . it is true to life that there aren  t always happy endings . sometimes its just not the happy ending you think it should be . many people were able to live happy lives though love and life of one was lost . if you are someone who looks a little deeper than the rest you  ll love this movie   ,1
the first time i saw this film in the theatre at a foreign film festival  i thought it intriguing  fascinating  the sensitive bi  sexual artist . so very european  so very dutch  i recently rented it for a second viewing and could hardly keep from laughing at that overworked theme of the mad writer with a religious  sexual orientation persecution complex . get a grip  this guy is a freeloader  living off of society . i suspect that the real reason he is having these fantasy  nightmares about the  spiderwoman  is that his guilt complex is kicking in after year  s of ignoring mother  s advice about getting into cars  and bed  with strangers  not only is he making outrageous sums of  probably taxfree  loot for making up stories  lying guilt trip  but he is too cheap to pay for a hair cut  hence he hustles the beauty salon owner . then he has the nerve to complain about the bill  but i also suspect the world has changed alot since this film was made . on a serious note it was entertaining to see some of jan de bont  s camera work and one of paul verhoeven  s earlier films . hmmm  maybe the world hasn  t changed so very much after all   ,1
i was true to my regard for mr . glover and ms . goldberg . i watched the entire film with my family and some friends . i have no idea what the movie was about . after much discussion  we all agreed that this was not one of their better efforts .  br    br   it doesn  t hang together very well . it is too choppy  and there is little comedy . i am disappointed . it could have been much better .  br    br   i waited months to see this film based on the liner notes .  br    br   don  t waste your money unless you are a completist and just want to see all of mr . glover  s and ms . goldberg  s films .  br    br   it was a poor way to spend an evening .  ,0
had fun watching this film . . despite the feeling i got a lot of the time  that this film was almost copying monsters inc . there  re quite a few things that are extremely similar between the two  the relationship between an animal  monster and a small child  other animals trying to break that relationship  etc . it felt like that pretty much throughout the film  to me .  br    br   one of the redeeming features though  is scrat   very very funny character  even if he serves no purpose    ,1
yeah  unfortunately i came across the dvd of this and found that it was incredibly awful .  br    br   first of all  the characters suck . i mean  come on  if some dork in an orange hat who calls himself  orange sherbert  is the best creative idea these guys could come up for a character  then they should definitely not be in the film  making scene . poor  costumes   bad  interviews   and basically there is not one  wrestler  on this whole disc with any shred of charisma .  br    br   the  wrestling  in splatter rampage wrestling is nothing more than these idiots gently and playfully bouncing together on a trampoline . they make sure to giggle together all the while  too  making the experience seem more like a toddler  s playtime than a  wrestling deathmatch  .  br    br   basically  splatter rampage wrestling is a pretty lackluster backyard wrestling clone . only  instead of blood  weapons  mayhem  and wrestling  we get a trampoline  giggling kids  terrible audio  and some guy called orange sherbert .  br    br   wrestling fan or not  avoid this dvd . it  s awful .  ,0
gday mates  just watched croc hunter the movie . it was alright but the show seems more real . this just seemed like a longer animalplanet episode with funnier lines and more characters . a few things steve described snakes fangs like hypodermic needles . yeeeowch  for reals you know that hurts . and cant they jump up high  hes all grabbin them by the tail and stuff . there was two major cleavage shots in this movie . when terry find that baby joey she goes like  we have to nurture them  just like a baby  . woah  i thought she was gonna up  breast feed that kid . that woulda made it pg    though . while on terry  did anyone notice on the movie and a lot of the show terry  s knowledge on ritual mating . she knows her sex stuffs . movie takes place in queensland  austrailia . i want a koala  dingo  and joey   br    br   steve  s dog sui actually has a purpose in this movie . albeit a small one which proves useless against the dynamite  wielding hottie .  br    br   oh and if anyone else watches this  try and agree with me in saying that country bumpkin fat lady with the herd of dogs was right in shotgunning the croc . he was eating her sheep   i would be mad too   ,0
i love playing football and i thought this movie was great because it contained a lot of football in it . this was a good hollywood  bollywood film and i am glad it won   awards . parminder nagra and kiera knightley were good and so was archie punjabi . jonathon rheyes meyers was great at playing the coach . jazz  parminder nagra  loves playing football but her parents want her to learn how to cook an want her to get married . when jazz starts playing for a football team secretly she meets juliet  kiera knightlety  and joe  jonathon rhyes meyers  who is her coach . when her parents find out trouble strikes but her dad lets her play the big match on her sisters pinky  archie punjabi  s  wedding . at the end her parents realise how much she loves football and let her go abroad to play .  ,1
i watched this movie after having so much of trouble in downloading it through rapidshare . and i have to say  it did not deserve it .  br    br   parinda was so hyped  that i was really looking forward to watch it .  br    br   parinda is one of those movies which fail to satisfy the standards set by other good indian film  makers  despite having a great story . it was even more pathetic to know  that the story itself was not original  it was loosely based on the classic  on the waterfront  .  br    br   anil kapoor was irritating  especially when he comes from america . the direction lacked quality many a times  except a few in  between scenes .  br    br   give this script to any of them  ram gopal verma  deepa mehta  mahesh bhatt  sudhir mishra  and i  m     sure  they  ll make a mind  blowing movie out of it .  br    br   i  m not saying parinda was bad . it was just not good enough .  ,0
if this movie were any worse  it would have been directed by uwe boll . this nonsensical mess makes ed wood look like hitchcock . it has been a while since i have seen this steaming pile  but i do remember that i wanted to do grievous bodily harm to all those involved . how anyone can give this movie any more than  star amazes me to the graciousness of all those that viewed this tripe . i give it one star because there is not a rating lower . all copies of this movie should be burned the ground sowed with salt and reserved as a landfill for the most toxic of waste . no  one copy should be kept under ultra hi security and shown only to film makers as an example of how not to do it .  ,0
gruveyman   comment below  you are a complete idiot . . . blinded by ignorance by the very city you have allegiance to . its that whiny arrogance  that you are ironically claiming the film exudes about sf  that makes you seem like such the typical la ahole  the only reason you felt the film was so self congratulatory about sf is because you are jealous . of course you don  t know it because you are so la jaded . first of all the film was completely factual about a beautiful city what has been filmed there and what has been filmed by some of its more famous locals . it says nothing bad about la and these accomplished directors choose to live in a beautiful city over la . they recognize that they went to film school in la and are obviously proud of that fact . they recognize that sf is close to la which is a benefit . the only negative thing that was said that relates to la  was about the studio executives . the same studio executives that hated these guys movies when they first saw them  but then those same movies went on to be huge world  wide grossing films . so why wouldn  t they have animosity towards the studio executive establishment and studio system  these are the only people they are trying to  disassociate from  and for good reasons  don  t be so sensitive  how can you say that francis ford coppola is the  so called  san francisco director  how is he not to be considered that  and who directed the godfather  coppola did . it was his vision that told the story on the screen that won it a best picture award . so what who gave him the job  he admits it in the documentary that he didn  t even want to do the movie . . . . so what  s your point  and so what if sophia wants to live in la  and that proves your point how  and tell me how they are not truly independent when they are funding a lot of their own movies . movies that are now considered classics . and  when they made movies from studio funding  one  it was la that came to them and said we want you to make these pictures and two  they used the money that they made from doing these pictures to fund their own . they said exactly that in the film .  br    br    your bitchy and self congratulatory whining would take on an air of greater self respect and credence if you never set foot on the ground you so claim to be superior to in this film .   br    br   how the hell can  bitchy  ness  and  self  congratulation  suddenly have an  air  of self respect and credence . . . . if they never go to la again  what a stupid and senseless comment  you inserted some big words in there . . . . and just don  t know how to use them  and  by the way  they never claimed nor implied they were superior to la  so what if they are giving a guy from new york an award in la . . . . again what the hell is your point  so if they go to la or new york they are hypocrites by simply preferring to live in sf  you make no sense .  br    br   san francisco is proud of itself and its heritage and the people who make it what it is today . this film just focused on one aspect . . . film  making . for you to take the time and type up such nasty comments about the city  not the movie  but the city and its people  only proves what it is we northern californians hate about people from la  this is a great documentary . . . very interesting  especially if you are from the bay area . . . but i recommend it to anyone .  ,1
i think that that creator  s  of this film  s concept deserves a lot more accolades than they probably ever received . it isn  t an oscar caliber film of course  but  at least for me  this film has left a lasting impression since i first saw it back in      in the theatre  .  br    br   i don  t think this is  and hope it isn  t  a spoiler  but imagine acting on your impulses . doing the first thought that pops into your head  saying the first words on your lips . . . no restraint  no conscious  nothing holding you back from saying or doing the things that  as intelligent adults  we know we shouldn  t actually say or do . if anything  this film only scratches the surface  it doesn  t go as far as it could go .  br    br   in a time when hollywood seems obsessed with remaking older  classics  to try and cash in on today  wouldn  t it be nice to see them remake an older film of modest success  for the sake of taking it to the next level  a bit further  or even to explore what the original crew didn  t  wouldn  t or couldn  t deal with   years ago   br    br   that  s just my opinion anyway . o   ,1
i thought that this movie was pretty lame . if you  re looking for cheesey  you may like this . i  myself  don  t mind a fair amount of cheese  but this was ridiculous . the progression of the movie bored me and the storyline was very weak .  br    br   the only thing entertaining about this movie was the day  glo zombies  but even that isn  t reason enough to see this flick .  ,0
this movie might not put the catholic church in the best light but it is telling a story based on true events . unfortunately not everything in life  including religion  are all nice and rosy . sometimes people and groups do things that at the time seem like the right thing but in retrospective do not look as great as they once did .  a love divided  tells the story of a family  yes it does incorporate religion  but really the story is about a family  and that family  s ability to stay together no matter what is thrown at them . this film is also based on true events which is not to say that this story  scene by scene  is true  but if you were to look at news articles from that time period you would be able to see that neither churches handled the incident in a way that was helpful towards the family . both churches are at fault here  the catholic church for forcing such a regulation on the family in the first place and not responding to the violence that came with it and the protestant church for telling the mother that she should just obey her husband and his priest and not put up a fight . in this case both let this family down . i believe that the film does a good job in showing this struggle in both the church and the family . it in no way shape or form is putting down the catholic church  just the opposite  it shows how one incident can change the course of that religion  s ideas and how one person can have an effect far more reaching then just themselves .  ,1
this film made for french tv deals with the tragic effect it has for a close knit family . when leo  the young man at the center of the story is diagnosed as having the aids virus  announces it to his parents  they just can  t believe it . the film is a character study on how this family deals with its subject .  br    br   the director  christophe honore  has to be congratulated for bringing this frank account to the screen . nowhere but in france could this story make it to the movies because of the subject matter .  br    br   the news has a devastating effect on marcel  the young brother who hears about what leo has contracted  in spite of the way the parents want to shelter him from reality .  br    br   yaniss lespart and pierre mignard do a convincing job in portraying the brothers .  ,1

i have never seen one of these scifi originals before  this was the first . i think it only fair to judge the acting  direction  production  set design and even the cgi effects on the other scifi movies . to compare it to your typical hollywood production is unfair . i will say  however  that overall aztec rex was not exactly reminiscent of werner herzog  s masterpiece aguirre  wrath of god .  br    br   i will begin by noting that  yes  i do recognize the fact that this movie has more to do with culture  clash than it does with dinosaurs . despite this being a made  for  tv sci  fi movie  there is some underlying context to the story which i shall examine . the symbolic elements included are evident enough .  br    br   consequently  as a student of history  theology  mythology and film i found the dialogue outrageous and the plot themes to be somewhat insulting . i am not asking for any mea culpas on behalf of the producers  as i said before the movie is what it is . but what concerns me is that much of the younger demographic for this movie probably rely on television to provide them their lessons when it comes to history and cultural diversity .  br    br   the main problem manifests itself most visibly with the character ayacoatl  not a commentary on dichen lachman  s performance  but simply how her character was written  although  i  ll say she has some work to do before she receives any emmy nods  . it is through her character that the spanish europeans actions are justified . her function in the film as the love interest of rios affirms that the european way is the right way  simply because they are european . there is really no other reason given . it  s really just left to the assumption that the viewer is meant to associate themselves with the europeans over the aztec because their dress  language  ideology  etc is more familiar to them than the aztec  so therefore the aztec are portrayed as adversarial and  backwards .  and it  s not simply that the viewer is left with that assumption due to ethnocentric perception on the viewers part  but it really seems like the story is trying to convince the viewer  as if the aztec were not capable of coming up with a plan  if not a better one  to lure a dinosaur to its death on a bed of punji sticks .  br    br   in fairness  there is a subgroup of the spanish who are portrayed as looting temples and intent on simply abusing the native mesoamericans . there is also a scene where we have the christian holy man noting the achievements of the aztec  they have agriculture  medicine  calendar  etc .   but in the end it is still the aztec warrior who is portrayed as the main antagonist of the movie  even over the  thunder lizards   more on that later  . he his portrayed as treacherous  duplicitous and attempts to dispatch the romantic european spaniard by tricking him into consuming hallucinogenic mind altering mushrooms  an important spiritual component to certain aspects and religions of the native meso  north americans  again  more on this later  so that he can keep the female he feels belongs to him and away from the spaniard .  br    br   now in analyzing the true nature of the story  leaving the obvious christian vs . pagan themes off of the table  from a symbolic standpoint  a viewer can easily take these so  called thunder lizards to be representatives of the mesoamerican ideology  theology  which in this movie is portrayed as being one intent on bloodthirstiness  mercilessness  cruelness  wicked  maybe even evil  in opposition  we have this group of christian wanderers  led by a young hernando cortes who are portrayed as naive  yet overall noble  lambs caught up in the dark heathen world of the aztec . also  the name of the film is aztec rex  leading one to believe that it is about dinosaurs out to eat people . however  what aztec rex translates to is aztec king  a the head of the aztec state  or in this instance  state  of  being .   hence  why the title of the film was changed  . and so who in fact do we see as the new aztec king at the end  it  s the remaining spaniard  rios . aztec rex is in reference to the new european ideology which overcame  through disease  bloodshed  war  famine  native americans . rios symbolizes the ideal european  as the presenters of this film would like them to be remembered  in opposition to cortes who represents the  practical  yet  still  noble european   . but when you examine the holocausts of the americas  let us be honest don  t the symbolic components of this film  s story have it backwards   br    br   i have to say aztec rex is at worst a little racist  or to be kind about it  ignorant at best .  br    br   and yes  i know it  s just a movie  all meant to be in fun  i understand  but so at the end we  re left with the idea that rios was the father of the last remaining aztec lines  i wonder what native mesoamericans would have to think about this ending . . . as for myself  i thought it was a little too self indulgent .  br    br   best supporting performance of the movie goes to ian ziering  s wig  although conspicuous  it did at least alter ziering  s appearance enough so that i didn  t think i was watching the yuppie from      leading a bunch of conquistadors into the heart of darkness . ziering actually proves himself to be a more  than  capable actor in this movie  i actually bought his performance  or at least i forgot it was ian ziering anyway . i don  t know whom his agent is  but he should get more work .  br    br   in closing  it was also a pleasure to see jim mcgee again . i  ve been a fan ever since his all too brief scene  stealing performance in      s scrooged .  br    br   alexander quaresma  deusexmachina    aol . com  ,0
the leap years stars some heavy hitters in the local and regional film and television scene . and yet  they cannot save this movie . it has so many things going against it  over acting  overly melodramatic  poor script  inconsistent direction and too few things going for it  decent music  good cinematography . this comment is mainly for anyone who throws all local movies into one basket after watching this film and says all local movies are bad . please do not judge the rest based on this one film . this is a television soap opera masquerading as a romantic feature film . my hopes were high when i bought my ticket and my hopes were dashed five minutes into the film .  ,0

okay . look  i  ve seen lots and i do mean lots of these types of films . you know  the ones where the dvd cover just look so good and scaarrryyy that you just cant wait to see it  well  i got got again . and i  m getting  pretty tired of it . but i digress . it  s pretty simple . it sucked  i know  rather juvenile  but it did . andi so agree with the other poster that if we had to sit through the boring thing  why oh why did the lead actress have to be so unnattractive  distractingly so if i may add . and the scowl she used convey unresolved pain  grief over the death of her daughter did little help . i mean  jesus . . oh  but the crawling  on  her  back  demon thingee was pretty neat . . .  ,0
i want cline and jessie go further in their relationship  i want to tell them that they were made for each other  that in a lot of moment in the film we want they to die for each other . their story is what we ever wanted and probably most of us never reached . this is about love but not stupid things like in  notting hills  or those kind of movie . this is life and i did believe in them  i did believe they were falling . . . this was so clever and touching . i have just finished to view it a minute ago and i m still there . . . i want to go to vienna . i want to see them as soon as possible again .  br    br   i have to say i was now becoming misanthropist and felt like if love was just a fake  a concept  but with this movie i realized that maybe somewhere  somehow and some when  something could really happen .  br    br   i  m french and didn  t know very well july delpy despite kieslowski  three colors  white  . . . now i have to see her other works because she looks like an angel and got a perfect acting .  br    br   i saw  before sunset   the sequel in paris  a few days before i saw  before sunrise  and their is no matter . they are both masterpieces . proof that you don  t need to impress the eyes with technology to get pure feelings . i  m sorry for my english which i m trying to best .  br    br   franck in france  ,1
as a fan of paris je  taime  i went to see new york  i love you with very high expectations . i gladly walked out with all my expectations met . it was funny  sweet  fast  paced  and entertaining . the film starts out with two cab hoppers  bradley cooper  justin bartha  trying to get to the same area but arguing which way to go . that was funny  and then the film goes into some of the best skits i have ever seen anywhere . there were four amazing ones out of all the good ones . those four i will start talking about . one features shia labeouf as a bellhop at a hotel who finds love in an old lady . the next one features orlando bloom as a music maker who is doing business with a woman played by christina ricci . another one features anton yelchin and olivia thirbly as two people going to prom  thirbly  s character being handicapped . the best one features eli wallach and cloris leachman as a bickering old couple . i will bring to your attention that nataile portman makes an impressive directorial debut directing  and writing a skit about a caretaker  and ethan hawke and maggie q are excellent as a flirting man and a hooker . new york  i love you is definitely as good  if not better than the     paris je  taime . the skits are well  paced  and the film shows how indie films should really be . the film  however  does not have as many famous directors as paris je  taime  which is why it was fantastic to live up to its excellence . if you want to laugh  see some great dramatic effects  see an amazing amount of great performances  and just plain be entertained then definitely go see new york  i love you .  ,1
one star . that  s all this documentary deserves . i haven  t felt this disappointed in watching a movie  let alone a documentary  in quite some time .  br    br   i  m a big fan of the  walking with . . .  series  including it  s nigel marvin spin  offs  for all their gleeful fun yet informative information . and although the subject of prehistoric man has never interested me nearly as much as other prehistoric creatures  the subject is still interesting and unique to explore . having seen all the other docs from the series  i figured i need to see this one as well  especially after seeing relatively good reviews in other places .  br    br   well for those of you who put up a good review of this doc . . . what were you thinking   lol .  br    br   though the information that they were able to get through was interesting  the presentation failed in every other way possible . it had a terrible flow  was incredibly unfocused in what it was trying to say  with information scrambled and sometimes out of of place   horrible effects  that includes the few moments of cgi and especially the makeup effects   and overused mtv  style camera effects .  br    br   speaking of the makeup effects  one reviewer here mentioned how laughable the scene was when the cavemen come across this giant ape and how it looks a lot like a   s man  in  suit horror movie . well there are plenty of moments just like that were the people portraying the ape men looked ridiculous and acted ridiculous . none of this is helped by horrible camera positions and compositions .  br    br   the worst part of all is none of it is shown in an interesting or dynamic way  or looks remotely real . it doesn  t even look like it was taken seriously . it also lacked any emotional punch that the predecessors of the series had . remember the episode in  walking with dinosaurs  of the fate of the ornithochirus  sp    that episode still gets me on the verge of tears every time i watch it . it  s this sort of engagement with the subject that lacks here most of all . when you are more engaged in the subject and it  s own personal story  even one that is just speculation  you care more about the facts surrounding it .  br    br   the only saving graces of this production are the fairly good narration  at least in the bbc version i saw  and the music . otherwise  do not bother even renting this one unless you want to have a good laugh  which i did frequently  but usually followed by rolling eyes  . this does not belong on the shelf with the other  walking with . . .  docs .  br    br   and does it make sense to learn that this doc was not produced or directly involved with the same people who did the others in the series  hmmm . . .  ,0
the movie  macarthur  begins and ends at gen . douglas macarthur  s  gregory peck  alma mata the us military academy of west point on the hudson . we see a frail   year old gen . macarthur give the commencement speech to the graduating class of     about what an honor it is to serve their country . the film then goes into an almost two hour long flashback on gen . macarthur  s brilliant as well as controversial career that starts in the darkest hours of wwii on the besieged island of corregidor in the philippines in the early spring of     .  br    br   told to leave he island for australia before the japanese military invade it gen . macarthur for the very first time in his military career almost disobeys a direct order from his superior us president franklin d . roosevelt  dan o  herlihy . feeling that he  ll be deserting his men at their greatest hour of need macarthur reluctantly  together with his wife and young son  did what he was told only to have it haunt him for the reminder of the war . it was that reason  his escape under fire from death or captivity by the japanese  that drove gen . macarthur to use all his influence to get fdr two years later to launch a major invasion of the philippians  instead of the island of formosa  to back up his promise to both the philippine people as well as the thousands of us pows left behind . that he  ll return and return with the might of the us army  navy to back up his pledge   br    br   in the two years up until the invasion of the philippine islands gen . macarther battered the japanese forces in the south

losses then any other allied commander in the war in the pacific   br    br   it was in        in the korean war that gen . macarthur achieved his most brilliant victory as well as his worst military defeat . after outflanking the advancing north korean army in the brilliant and perfectly executed  with the invading us marines suffering less then    casualties  back door or left hook invasion of inchon gen . macarther feeling invincible sent the us  un forces under his command to the very border  along the yalu river  of communist red china . told by his subordinates that he  s facing the threat of a massive ground attack by communist chinese troops gen . macarthur pressed on anyway until that attack did materialized cutting the us  un forces to ribbons . the unstoppable wave after wave of attacking red chinese troops forced the us  un forces to retreat in the  big bug out  of     with their very lives  leaving all their equipment behind  across the north korean border even abandoning the south korean capital city of seoul  this turned out to be one of the biggest military disaster in us history with the us forces losing a record  in the korean war       lives on the very first day  nov .           of the communist chinese invasion   br    br   shocked and humiliated in what he allowed  due mostly to his own arrogance  to happened macarthur went on the offensive not against the advancing communist chinese and noth koreans forces but his own commander and chief pres . harry s . truman  ed flanders  in him not having the spin or guts to do what has to be done launch a full scale invasion of communist china with nuclear weapons if necessary to prevent its troops from overrunning the korean peninsula  for pres . truman who had taken just about enough garbage from gen . macarthur in him running off his mouth in public in how he was mishandling the war in not going all out  like macarthur wanted him to  against the red chinese this was the last straw  on april        pres . truman unceremoniously relived gen . macarthur from his command as supreme commander of the us  un forces in korea  pres . truman  s brave but very unpopular decision also  by not going along with macarthur  s total war strategy  prevented a third world war from breaking out with the soviet union  communist china  s ally  who at the time  like the us  had the atomic bomb  pres . truman   s controversial decision to dump the very popular gen . macarthur also cost him his re  election in     with his polls numbers so low  in the mid    s  that he withdrew  in march of that year  from the us presidential campaign   br    br   in was gen . macarthur  s misfortune to be around when the political and military climates in the world were changing in how to conduct future wars . with the horrors of a nuclear war now  in         a reality it would have been national suicide to go all out  like gen . macarthur wanted to  against the red chinese with it very possibly touching off a nuclear holocaust that would engulf not only the us ussr  red china but the entire world  it was that important reality of future war that gen . macarthur was never taught  since the a and h bomb weren  t yet invented  in west point .  br    br   back to     we can now see that gen . macarthur  after finishing his commencement speech at west point  had become both an older and wiser soldier as well as  since his retirement from the us military  elder statesman in his feeling about war and the utter futility of it . one thing that gen . macarthur was taught at an early age  from his civil war general dad douglas macarthur sr  that stuck to him all his life was that to a soldier like himself war should be the very last  not first  resort in settling issues between nations . in that it  s the soldiers who have to fight and die in it . it took a lifetime  with the advent of the nuclear age  for gen . macarthur to finally realize just how right and wise his dad a congressional

  national lampoon goes to the movies        is absolutely the worst movie ever made  surpassing even the witless  plan  from outer space .  the lampoon film unreels in three separate and unconnected vignettes  each featuring different performers . the only common thread is the total lack of any redeeming qualities .  br    br   well  maybe there is one . another reviewer on this site has said that the fleeting nude shots are nice  and he  s right . misses ganzel and dusenberry flash their assets prettily  in part one and part two  respectively . but their glamorous displays are  alas  wasted . the directors seem to have forgotten that even ta needs a credible story to surround it  and there  s none in sight .  br    br   the third segment  starring robby benson and richard widmark  is the most disgusting of the three  and an unfortunate choice as the windup of this film . benson plays an eager  beaver young policeman  brightly reporting for his first day of duty  ready to rid the streets of evil . he is paired with an old  cynical cop played by widmark  and when these oil  and  water partners set out on their first patrol together  we sense a possible redemption of the film  s earlier failures . maybe  just maybe  the cynical old  timer will be reformed by his new partner  s stalwart sense of duty and loyalty . maybe all will end happily after all . but alas  this movie heads straight for the toilet  with no redemption  no happy ending  no coherent story of any kind .  br    br   before  national lampoon goes to the movies   i thought i had already seen the worst schlock that hollywood could possibly turn out . unfortunately  i hadn  t seen the half of it .  br    br    ,0

even   years after the end of the vietnam war  jacknife  came not too late or was even superfluous . it  s one of the few that try to deal with the second sad side of the war the time after . different from movies like  taxi driver  or  rambo  which use to present their main characters as broken heroes in a bad after war environment this movie allows the audience to face a different view on the vietnam vets . their development is shown very precisely before and especially after the war . the problems are obvious but in all this tragic there is always the feeling of some hope on the basis of love and friendship .  jacknife  might be the quietest vietnam movie ever but after almost   years this is really plausible and therefor justified . moreover  it can make us believe that the war has not finished  yet at least for some of us .  br    br   the three main characters are amazing . de niro has done one of his best jobs but ed harris is the star of this movie . possibly  this was his best performance ever .  ,1

proof why hollywood conventions are in place . stale dialogue  underdeveloped and flat characters and a disjointed storyline are only part of the problems with this gangster classic wannabe . an attempt to be daring and different but this appears to be a slap  together attempt at recreating the magic of arthur penn  s bonnie and clyde       and george roy hill  s butch cassidy and the sundance kid        truly innovative filmmakers and films  but falling well below the bar . problems with storylines being self  explanatory result in the need for a voiceover to explain problem sections . the editing appears again to be an attempt to duplicate the previous classics but is occasionally disjointed and cause more problems for me technically . unnecessary shots are thrown in to justify the filming of them but would have better served the viewer by sitting on the cutting room floor . stills  black  white montages and period music are thrown in from time to time in attempts to either be different or to cover up for scenes that can  t transition well or to replace scenes that just didn  t work at all and again are reminiscent of butch cassidy and the sundance kid       .  br    br   overly dramatic pauses between sentences  random shots of surrounding scenery that wasn  t needed for storytelling plus over  the  top acting of bit players and supporting actors was reminiscent of the backyard camcorder directors of the late      s  i was left wondering who was in charge of this film during production and during post  production . the playing of music in most two shots and close  ups and then suddenly stopping in wide shots overly emphasized a weak musical score . no sound editing was drastically apparent as the bulk of the film was gunshots  doors  footsteps and dialogue  a style used in the late    s through the mid     s by new directors  but lacking background noise causing it to seem artificial  particularly the tire squeaks on dirt roads . in my honest opinion the biggest problem of all is there are no  likeable  characters for the audience to route for nor were we lead to see as the protagonists of the story . neither the gangsters nor the lawmen were characters i wanted to see win and neither were focused on as the  hero   a necessity for any story to work for me . we know from penn  s and hill  s movies who the  heroes  are . even though they are criminals  we like them and want to see them get away . i could care less who was on the screen in this film . i got the impression that john milius was trying to give off a non  historically accurate reenactment documentary of the events surrounding john dillenger  s life from june     to july      his death  .  br    br   to be fair  there are some moments of good solid storytelling  which are moments that shine forth brightly from the dark and dismal canister in which this film sits . john milius gets better thankfully in future films where he doesn  t seem to try to  copy  other filmmakers . dillinger       isn  t a total waste as many stars and famous faces who were at the cusp of breaking out are involved with this directorial  big budget  debut  but wait for it on a classic movie channel rather than spending money to rent or buy .  br    br    ,0
an awful film  it must have been up against some real stinkers to be nominated for the golden globe . they  ve taken the story of the first famous female renaissance painter and mangled it beyond recognition . my complaint is not that they  ve taken liberties with the facts if the story were good  that would perfectly fine . but it  s simply bizarre   by all accounts the true story of this artist would have made for a far better film  so why did they come up with this dishwater  dull script  i suppose there weren  t enough naked people in the factual version . it  s hurriedly capped off in the end with a summary of the artist  s life   we could have saved ourselves a couple of hours if they  d favored the rest of the film with same brevity .  ,0
recently shown on cable tv the movie opens with a disclaimer distancing itself from any co  operation of real life persons that in itself is an eye catcher . yet the script and acting from the main characters is superb and i found myself engrossed throughout . due in no small way to the crisp  thoughtful and interesting dialogue . the film is about a meeting on one day between two real life musical  legends  who formerly composed together then seperated . the film captures the essence of their lives and philosophies  in a story which proffers an explanation for their initial  split  . what is so impressive is that the actors give such seemingly realistic portrayals of the characters they play  faults and all  that this viewer at least was left believing i was witnessing a true event in almost every detail . the great skill of this play is that with astute writing and fine acting a movie basically about  two of us  talking can make an excellent picture . worthy of at least an  out of   .  ,1
this movie was banned in england  why  tom savini  george romero  dario argento  lucio fulci and others had done far worse before and have continued to so since . . .  br    br   this movie has all the basic elements of a decent   s or early    s horror film . good looking girls  who can  t act to save their lives  by the way   a terrible lightning storm with a torrential downpour  a scythe  a crazy brother wandering around the family estate  and actually a pretty damn good twist at the end . but banned  seriously . when the english parliament banned this movie  the italians probably laughed their collective asses off at how backwards and prudish the brits really were .  br    br   there was maybe two minutes of total screen time devoted to the violence and gore  which was greatly underdone  . there was nudity but no sex although allusions to sex were made  obviously . but absolutely nothing worthy of being banned .  br    br   i would like to see what could have been done if the filmmakers had a decent budget to work with . as it stands  the film is entertaining  but the lack of picture and sound quality take away from the end result .  br    br   banned . . . what a joke . . .  ,0
while most of the movie is very amateurish  the kosher slaughter scene is played up  but not untrue . kosher law says that an animal must be conscious when the blade touches it  s skin . the kosher slaughter scene is accurate as anyone knows who has seen one  or has seen the peta film showing a kosher slaughter  in which the animals throat is cut  and the esophagus cut out while it is still alive  conscious  and obviously suffering . we must remember that history is written by the victors . is one even allowed to even think that maybe the nazis were right    br    br   doesn  t it say anything that the nazis had outlawed this vicious religious slaughter  and the jews are still practicing it even today   ,0
although some may call it a  cuban cinema paradiso   the movie is closer to a how green was my valley  a memory film mourning for a lost innocence . the film smartly avoids falling into a political trap of taking sides  pro  castro  anti  castro   focusing instead in the human frailty of the characters and the importance of family . filled with good acting  in particular from mexican actress diana bracho  who plays keitel  s wife . a masterpiece  filled with references to classic movies  from casablanca to chaplin  s city lights . gael garcia bernal plays a small role which is critical for the dramatic payoff of the story . tv director georg stanford brown  in a rare return to acting  remember the rookies    plays a homeless bum who acts as greek chorus  superbly . it is a pity that this movie  originally titled dreaming of julia  has been released in the states by thinkfilm with the atrocious title of cuban blood  which has nothing to do with the movie .  ,1

i feel this is one of the best movies i  ve seen  i  m an older male and love most westerns . i love movies based in part at least on facts  if i am not mistaken this is such a movie . i also like revenge type movies  this qualifies there as well in my opinion . some of my favorite parts of the movie were the opening scene with the whipping and the barn shooting scene . i felt the corral beating scene was a little overkill but did not affect how i feel about the complete movie . i saw what i think is a continuation of this movie in a gun smoke episode . i also enjoyed that . i recommend taking the time to watch this movie  i will watch it again . i also felt the romance parts of this movie were well played . i thought it was so out of character for randy travis to play a villain type  but i always enjoy his acting .  ,1

this sword    sorcery story of an appallingly brutal and callous  hero  vanquishing an evil king is worthless in almost every detail . the acting is horrible from the leads to the supporting roles . the leering  gloating glee with which the director shows the hero smearing blood around is absolutely disgusting nor is it redeemed by any justice to his cause  since he is as bad as the people he  s fighting . z  movie editing is abundant  including a scene where a character  dies  from a sword thrust that very obviously missed completely   br    br   the movie is clearly banking on the charms of the female leads  barbi benton and lana clarkson  who are paraded around mostly naked throughout the movie . as a    something male  i will not pretend that female flesh on the screen doesn  t attract me . but the treatment of their characters is so degrading and the sex scenes so casual and joyless  that i couldn  t enjoy even this aspect of the movie .  br    br   most cheesy movies of this era are at least somewhat redeemed by a light  hearted  tongue  in  cheek feel  the sequel is better in this regard   but deathstalker seems to take itself completely seriously as heroic fantasy . no way  avoid at all costs   br    br   rating    out of  .  ,0

where to begin  there  s so much wrong and horrible about this movie i am not sure where to start . okay  the two stooges who wrote this crapper . joseph green and rex carlton  first they couldn  t make up their so  called minds for a name . my guess they split the difference  that  s why the main title is brain that wouldn  t die  but the end screen says head that wouldn  t die . neither one knows anything about the medical profession . after all doctors take oaths to  do no harm  . killing a woman for a head transplant would be considered  harm  . plus  a little thing called blood and tissue matching . rejection would spell death for jan in the pan . plus who keeps a patch work monster . what medical school did bill graduate from  frankenstien university  old fu  or mad scientist tech  the monster had no name  that bugs the hell out of me . plus  the brilliant surgeon doctor bill cortner doesn  t know how to keep a patient sedated  all and all a disaster of a movie  it  s incredibly stupid and unwatchable  except on mst  k . i give it the thanksgiving turkey .  ,0

ever wanted to know just how much hollywood could get away with before the hayes code was officially put into effect  well  unfortunately  convention city  is lost  so well just have to watch  tarzan and his mate  to find out . for      there is a remarkable amount of sexual innuendo and even exposed flesh . just look at jane  s nude swim . while tarzan is often thought of as b  adventure films made for young boys and no one else  this picture proves that the series was originally very adult . over seventy years later  it is still as sexy as it was when it came out .  br    br   in addition to the envelope pushing taboo nature  it is a superb and exciting adventure story . i  ve always enjoyed the jungle films that hollywood churned out in the   s and the   s  but there are few from the genre i  d call great films .  tarzan and his mate  is by far the best film from this long gone subgenre . the sequences of the attacks on the safari by either apes or natives still manage to create tension today . also  the animals are all too cool  espescially the apes throwing boulders  . the acting won  t win any major awards soon  but is certainly more than adequate for this type of picture . the film is once again stolen by cheetah  the smartest monkey in the jungle . one of the most entertaining examples of pre  code hollywood out there .  ,1

melissa sagemiller  wes bentley  eliza dushku and casey affleck play young students at middleton college in the town of middleton . the four teenagers form two love triangles . one night during an ominous full moon they drive and argue along a slippery and twisting mountain road . not looking properly they careen into another car and one or more of them are killed . the ghostly nightmare begins . . . pretty lousy and politically correct horror flick without gore and nudity . it  s obviously influenced by  carnival of souls  . the cinematography is decent  unfortunately there is zero suspense .  out of    just another instantly forgettable teeny  bopper trash .  ,0
neil simon  s the odd couple set up a model for many of his later plays . felix unger and oscar madison were the unsuitably paired roommates in the original  the former being picky and neat  the latter being slovenly and loose . simon would rewrite  less successfully  the play in the     s as the new odd couple  with female roommates . he made it a mixed couple  a woman with her daughter  and a man  in the goodbye girls . he also gave it an additional twist in     with the sunshine boys  a broadway hit starring jack alberson and sam levine as al lewis and willie clark  the aged  semi  retired vaudevillians . here the  apartment  problem is reduced to a teaming of two men who can  t stand each other . the     film starred walter matthau as willie  and george burns as al .  br    br   in actuality  al probably does not think totally badly of willie  willie is pathological on the subject of al . first al had little habits  such as accidentally spitting slightly when pronouncing words beginning with the letter  t   and slightly jabbing willie with his index finger  on stage . secondly  al retired when his wife died . willie was not ready to retire  and has been forcing his nephew and agent  ben  richard benjamin  to try to get him jobs in commercials . but willie can  t remember lines unless they are funny  and keeps flubbing them . so he rarely is able to stay to the end of a rehearsal for a commercial .  br    br   ben is asked to get the two back together for a live scene of their most famous sketch on a television show about american comedy . he does bring al to see willie  and the sparks begin flying  as neither can figure out what the other is doing  and this is just in rehearsal . on top of that  willie is insisting on changes  minor ones  but they throw off al  such as saying  enter     when al knocks on the door . the initial rehearsal is a failure  but ben manages to get them to the taping of the show . the question is if they will complete the scene in the finished program or will willie wring al  s neck   br    br   the three leads  matthau  burns  and benjamin  do very well with the one  liners  frequently reminiscent of vaudeville patter  example  chest pains . . . i  m getting chest pains uncle willie . every thursday i come here and get chest pains    so  come on fridays    . benjamin strives to prove his deep affection for his uncle  although matthau  s rough outer shell makes it difficult  he only smooths down when he discusses the glory days of vaudeville  . matthau has a little better grasp on reality  at first  than burns  who seems senile by his repeating himself  but in actuality matthau  s sense of rejection by the world that once applauded him make him less willing to behave properly . burns is not senile  he takes things slowly . but he seems far happier in accepting his retirement .  br    br   i call this a final  voyage of discovery  for our modern lewis and clark . al and willie transcend their old skits  as they gradually end up realizing that they have more in common in their old age than they thought . even the irascible willie admits that al may be  to him  a pain in the ass  but he was a funny man .  br    br   burns was not the original choice for the part of  al lewis   supposedly dale of the team smith and dale  . jack benny was . benny probably would have done a good job  but ill  health forced him out  he died in      . burns  whose last involvement in any film was in the solid gold cadillac in     as the narrator  turned in such a fine performance that he got the  oscar  for best supporting actor  and was to have a career in movies in the next decade in such films as oh god   oh god  you devil and going in style . he died in     age     having proved that he was more than just a brilliant straight man for his wife gracie allan .  ,1
something i really love about this woman  s short films was the elusiveness of theme   especially in  living with happiness .  this film has some nice beginnings   unusual location and the potential for a strange cinematic treatment  but fails to succeed with clunky expositional dialogue  patchy performances and very television coverage .  br    br   it  s once again charming television and very ordinary cinema . the ideas are so fleshed out that they almost feel pat like a television commercial . but the sentiment is good so we can  t complain too much .  br    br   i really would love to see this director make a full length animation and try and work with a producer who doesn  t demand so much boring clarity .  ,0
ok well i found this movie in my dads old pile of movies and it looked pretty good from the cover but the movie actually sucked   ok the first story with the swimmer was pretty good but it took a while to get into  then the one with the boy was completely retarded  it wasn  t even scary  his dream sounds like a little kid  s bedtime story . then the news girls one was completely retarded too . i  m sure someones going to call up the news guy and ask him to go out with you . but that one ended cool where she stabbed him and she was in the hospital and she saw him on t . v and he said all that junk to her . next was that pretty gay story about the guy who brought back the dead people . . omg its so stupid i  m not even going to say any more about it . the last one was the best . it wasn  t that scary but the idea of the story was pretty cool . . uh yeah the girl gets possessed and she kills all her classmates or something . then when they  re all done telling their dreams to each other the losers get on the bus  to hell ahahahah  and they see all the people from their dreams on the bus  ha  . the end .  ,0
i love this film and it is such a wonderful example of a family jeopardy  a romantic love story  and a very sad story plot . everything was just so perfect and excellent about this film . it was such a great mixture of actors and actresses and with some laughs and a lot of cries this film deserves to get plenty of awards . with the mention of beautiful scenario  and although i would relate this film to the notebook and the family stone  it was sort of much more cunning  sad  and brilliant than those films . the evening tells of a love story between an old woman dreaming back to her younger years  and her two daughters stay by her side while she is not well . the story dating back is so strongly told and wonderful i was sitting on the edge of my seat . you really get to know all the characters and by the end  i was wanting to watch it all over again . this is a amazingly sad and vividly acted and plotted movie that is really one of a kind and should be seen by all for how wonderful it really is . all the performances are astonishing and the film captures your attention from the very beginning and never lets go . i loved it  and am so glad that i watched it for it was truly an astonishing film . . .  ,1

  algie  the miner  is one bad and unfunny silent comedy . the timing of the slapstick is completely off . this is the kind of humor with certain sequences that make you wonder if they  re supposed to be funny or not . however  the actual quality of the film is irrelevant . this is mandatory viewing for film buffs mainly because its one of the earliest examples of gay cinema . the main character of algie is an effeminate guy  acting much like the stereotypical  pansy  common in many early films . the film has the homophobic attitude common of the time .  algie  the miner  is pretty awful  but fascinating from a historical viewpoint .        ,0

most people     gave this movie a   and those who don  t are being too critical or maybe expected something else . this is one of my favorite movies from the    s  it grows on you  and has it all . i just got it on dvd and   years later it still does not disappoint  having plenty of action  drama  romance  and even comedy . add to that the great car chases  automatic weapon shootouts and lots of stuff blowing up and you have a fun  edge of your seat experience  you will even be humming or whistling the main theme song for days after seeing this .  br    br   you can watch this movie with your wife  gf and you will both enjoy it lots . the premise is that of a paperback book hero  like doc . savage  really existing and helping people fight evil so he can write the story is almost true to life here . the actor jake speed is also a director  producer and writer of many films . in this film jake speed  the character  is an indiana jones adventurer type  he usually uses his head to get out of sticky situations but will sometimes resorts to brute firepower  yay   and sheer dumb luck too   . keep an eye out for his one  james bond  hi  tech equipment  the ultimate road warrior suv dropping out of the sky .  br    br   the heroine is the very beautiful young love interest from the early jim carey vampire movie  once bitten  and here she is a little older and still a knockout even compared to her teenage blonde little sister .  br    br   the bad guys are  real bad  men and are the worst lowlife villainous scum you love to hate . the ending is just perfect and can stand alone or invite a sequel  sadly never made  but you can just imagine what would happen next   br    br   you have to see this movie just because it will entertain and amuse you and that  s worth the price of a ticket .  ,1

oh  how we have a misfire here a film so bad that your mind will wonder and drift away onto other things as it wastes your time with brain numbingly poor production values character stereotypes of the worst and racist kind since d . w . griffith referred to the chinese character in broken blossoms as  the yellow man   characters so unimaginative and un  engaging that it  s difficult to watch as well as a narrative that plods along at such a slow  stupid and pointless pace that you will question the very people who say they like this film .  br    br   prizzi  s honor is a film that ends up being an absolute post  modern disaster in every which way possible . the film is a messy and senseless disaster that has john huston directing kathleen turner and jack nicholson staring and everybody else filling in the gaps as either dumb stereotypes or supporting characters that weep on a phone now and again or bicker with a main character . prizzi  s honor is a film that falls into a genre of neo  noir  comedy  romance  action  gangster and overall crime  this twinned with its director and cast should be enough to propel it through some sort of a story some sort of a sequence of good scenes some sort of intelligence in the form of a screenplay or something else but no  what we get is a nasty and ugly film revolving around nothing at all .  br    br   i  ll give a couple of examples of how shoddy this horror show of a film actually is . firstly  the film thinks it  s a love story and it thinks this for about an hour of its time of my time . charley partanna  nicholson  is an assassin who kills people for a family that he works for in new york and yet he resembles his character out of one flew over the cuckoo  s nest more than an international hit  man . he meets and falls in love with irene walker  turner  who is another assassin and they hit it off but as the poor excuse for a plot plays out  it appears all is not right . i read that the plot for this film is  a professional hit man and hit woman fall in love  only to discover that they have each been hired to kill the other .  well  yes that  s true but that actual revelation doesn  t happen until about twenty minutes to the end  nicholson plays partanna like someone with an iq of    he walks around seemingly making observations and talking out loud about things he sees he talks like he is either drunk or has a more serious problem from within and worse of all we never get the feeling he is an assassin  one really poorly shot assassination early on  that actually happens off screen  is not enough to suggest this guy is a hard  bodied  best of the best  international hit  man .  br    br   so with a main character who is un  likable and un  realistic  we move to the script . the first hour and a half is just a cinematic dead zone with what ever there is to suggest traces of life merely poor conventions partanna slouches around on the phone or in person asking the same things over and over again  do i marry her   do i love her  what is love  what do i do   and it gets so repetitive  it  s not even able to act as good humour . this twinned with the way he always seemed to be on the phone to someone a girl called maerose prizzi  huston  played by director john  s daughter which served absolutely no purpose to the plot whatsoever and seemed to be there for laughs as was the scene in which she tells her father about how she slept with partanna and loved it  that got me thinking  was this supposed to be funny  should i be laughing  the film felt like a smart mafia picture what with its opening scene of a wedding  al the godfather  and consequential scenes with a touch of noir as gangsters  police men and assassins were introduced into the film . but what we get is something very  very different .  br    br   the second hour revolves around some sort of a kidnap plot right  the love and romance is dealt with  maybe the film will kick  start . i was so very wrong with more characters continuously talking very slowly and very deliberately in a monotone way  we have a kidnap scene involving some guy coming out of his office this scene sums the film up . everything is briefly planned and then executed in a heavy handed and dumb way that just makes it look cheesy . we do not get to see them arrive to some dramatic music perhaps they have to get through security to get to the elevators maybe they have to be careful of civilians when they hide in their chosen places and when that random woman steps out of the elevator and the gunshot occurs  the scene isn  t even edited correctly . some suspense  some drama  do i shoot or don  t i    maybe some slow motion as the character has to quick draw before it  s too late  anything but how it was actually executed . prizzi  s honor continues its monotonous and uninteresting decent into filmic oblivion as it nears its climax . it  s a film where cameras reflect in windows lights reflect in sides of cars and  dead  chauffeurs blink when nudged . prizzi  s honor is a jumbled and messy film that will try the patients of any film  goer and don  t say it was a comedy because i didn  t laugh with it  at it is another matter . the film is repetitive  drawn out and colourless in its vision and scope for originality  there is no honour here .  ,0
this is one of the worse cases of film drivel i have seen in a long while . it is so awful  that i am not sure where to begin  or even if it is worth it . the plot is the real problem  and i feel sorry for  sly  as he puts in a decent performance for his part . but that plot . . . oh dear oh dear . i particularly love the way near the end he manages to pop from the foot of a mountain to the top  whilst the helicopter is on the way . a climb of a day or two takes him all of five minutes  i could go on but it isn  t worth it . apart from the grim opening  which even a five year old would be able to predict the outcome of  the rest is drivel . sorry folks  but this is about as bad as film making gets .  ,0

this is a movie about making a movie . such movies may be entertaining  but they need some substance  to do so . it did not happen here  i am afraid . mr coppola did not inherit his father  s skills  unfortunately  neither did his sister  who can however make movies which one might watch  .  br    br   i do wonder how this movie came to get such rave reviews .  br    br   let  s see the lead male actor  supposedly a director  is as expressive as a frozen squid and his voice has the same pitch whatever he says  the lead female actress has an expression on her face that never changes  the plot is totally segmented in bits with perhaps one single connecting element  the movie within the movie idea must be more stale than paleolithic rocks . . . would that be enough   br    br   i regretted every single moment i watched this movie . a walk with the dog is far superior entertainment to this unbelievably lame movie . it  s as if a franois truffaut plot were directed by dick cheney . . .  br    br   brazil  some other classic sf movies  you must be really joking . . .  ,0
actually had to stop it . don  t get me wrong  love bad monster movies . but this one was way too boring  regardless of the suspenseful music that never leads you anywhere . the actress had too many teeth and that moment when she makes contact with one of the beasts  was way too obvious a clich . this film totally betrays the cover on the dvd which looks pretty interesting . from the cover one expects a giant monster  but you get these cute not as gigantic as expected electric eels . moved on to watch another film called the killer rats but that  s another review . deep shock was really crap  a big shame considering the fact that it looks pretty high budget .  ,0
big splashy film of the broadway music . nathan  frank sinatra  loves to roll the dice and organize illegal crap games . blonde loving adelaide  vivian blaine  wants to marry him if he gives up craps . he decides on one last game when sky masterson  marlon brando    who bets big  is in town . he bets sky that he can  t get mission worker sarah brown  jean simmons  to go with him to havana . that may sound like a strange plot summary but so is the movie   br    br   this is a real mixed bag   there  s some wonderful stuff here . the songs are all good and the dancing is incredible . the real show stopper is at the crap game at the end . also brando is really quite good here   it might seem strange to think of him singing and dancing but he pulls it off . i have to admit seeing big  bulky brando pulling off some difficult dance moves was a lot of fun  also sinatra is pretty good and blaine is just wonderful as his long  suffering girlfriend . her song and dance numbers are definite highlights here .  br    br   now for the bad parts   jean simmons is a wonderful actress but she  s stuck with a drab colorless role and can  t do much with it . the movie is far too long at    minutes   the scenes between brando and simmons really drag and should have been shortened . also most of the characters speak in very precise english   contractions are never used . maybe it  s trying to be amusing coming out of the mouths of gangsters but i found it jarring and it kept throwing me out of the movie .  br    br   it  s worth catching for the songs and dances but the over length of it does get to you after a while . i give it a  .  ,1
the acting wasn  t great  the story was full of simplistic turns and transparent characters . it  s about the repercussions of the struggle between right  wing flemish block voters on the one side and the moroccon people living in the belgian city antwerp on the other side . is it a political analysis  is it some kind of belgian west side story or modern romeo and juliet  the film just isn  t strong enough to answer both questions  supposing those were the director  s questions  too  . still  some of the scenes could function as a kind of ken loach film  set in antwerp . after all  this city has been the starting point of the extremist right  wing flemish block party and is struggling with a lot of problems and tensions between different populations and cultures . it  s very difficult to make a film about this situation  and this one isn  t successful  unfortunately . still  it  s telling a story about a very real and complicated situation in present  day belgium . the few foreign viewers watching should try and enjoy it and realise it  s not the actual film that is important but the social dividing lines behind it that haunt belgium  a   million people country  in the     s  br    br   dries van dongen  ,0
i have seen a lot of bad movies with big actors in it . but this movie was terrible . i have yet to see why people thought it was funny . the idea behind it is stupid . plus all the things that are supposed to be funny are just dumb . why anyone would want to watch this more than once just baffles me   ,0
my wife is a fanatic as regards this show . that being the case i bought her seasons one through three and season four is on order . i personally think the show is one big farce the cast is equally bad . alyssa milano should have stuck to the other trash movies she made such as poison ivy  embrace of the vampire to name a few  the other female supporting cast members are equally inept in their portrayals . i  ve seen better special effects in the old republic pictures serials i saw as a child . i can understand why the male leads remained on the show for such short periods of time even though i don  t know if it was their own choosing or not . please . please don  t renew for another season as enough is enough  bob  ,0
cradle of fear  br    br   this isn  t a movie where intricate delicate little narrative nuances occupy our attention . this is not a film where the special effects are supposed to leave us slack  jacked uttering that sense of whoa . what it is though is a slice of lo  fi goth horror which leaves little to the imagination  created in the eyes of the director  alex chandon  as  a throwback to sleazy    s and    s horror  .  br    br   this is a very visceral experience for  hours  where four plot lines are connected through lots of watery blood  reams of dismembered body parts and innards  tied by an intestinal thread of revenge .  br    br   the purveyor of such horrific violence is dani filth  lead  singer of the metal band cradle of filth  executing a role he was destined to play .  br    br   as other  s have said  there is nothing new about wanting to carryout occultist revenge . in this particular context a convicted sexual predator and murderer  kemper  the father of our devilish avenging  angel  compels his son to exact retribution on those who are some how connected to convicting him to purgatory within an insane asylum .  br    br   what this provides for the chandon  who should be congratulated on also penning and editing this piece  is the opportunity to let his sick mind run free . he seems to take delight in the idea of splattering blood into the orifices of those on screen  and into every nook and cranny that can be reached . we are also treated to close  ups of skull  s being crushed  demonic rape  and other assorted imagery to engage those who relish getting up close and personal to their horror . and for some of those who closely follow these type of films  there is the odd sequence which may have you thinking   did i just see what i thought i did   because of course pretty woman this  aint . it reminds me of some of the gore  fests created out of italian horror some   to   years ago  and a number of other works where disgusting images have left their mark but not the context in which they were viewed .  br    br   story  of the set is particularly intriguing where the idea of ones obsession can ultimately lead to death in the pursuit of internet violence through the  sick room   where the user is in control of how a life can be snuffed out . further acknowledgements should also go out to a pounding soundtrack that allows filth to exercise his daytime talent  and an effective use of drum and bass  often overlooked in film  making as a viable form of supporting visuals . using the city of london as a backdrop with real people as opposed to movie stand  ins also adds support to the commando feel of the film . ok  classic it may not be  but blood  guts  intestines  occult and demons in a slightly perverse unproblematic way it is .  ,0
a bizarre and brilliant combination of talents between the director  robert siodmak and ella raines as a secretary trying to save her boss from the electric chair by tracking down a mysterious  phantom  woman  and franchot tone as a crazed and murderous sculptor . as well there are some fascinating smaller parts played by elisha cook jr as a drugged out trap drummer  as well as the other characters who make up parts of the conspiracy . if you  re used to seeing raines in more wholesome parts  she  s allowed to go overboard here  especially in her scenes with cook . franchot tone also plays someone very different  and though it isn  t a convincing part  he acts phenomenally . while the conspiracy is too contrived  the film has real atmosphere and is very interesting .  ,1
was this the greatest movie that i have ever seen  no . was it the worst  no .  br    br   as a mother of four kids  it is nice to watch something that was light and amusing . it was great  but it was cute .  br    br   i think that it definitely had some room to improve  but it tried .  br    br   i am not sure if this movie deserves the extreme level of abuse from the other reviewer . they obviously do not care for eva longoria . i think that she was better in this than in the sentinel . i think that movies are a matter of opinion . the actors play a huge role in whether it is a hit or a flop .  br    br   maybe the cast did not work out . maybe there were too many things going on .  br    br   i just wanted to speak up for an average movie  not a terrible one . it could just be a chick flick . kind of like the movie the split  up or french kiss . my husband still talks about those .    ,0
i am a massive fan of the book and orwell is certainly my favourite writer ever since studying animal farm at gcse . i bought the dvd out of sheer curiosity  burton is an actor i hold in high regard so when i heard that he played the role of o  brien i was swung .  br    br   i watched the trailer on the dvd first and some fears started to set in  mostly regarding the frankly terrible  theme song   hearing the eurythmics mechanically shouting        over and over again to an electronic beat is as bad as it sounds .  br    br   the acting on a whole is pretty good  burton and hurt play their roles well and the tension that exists in the ministry of truth towards the end can be felt  especially in the harrowing room    scene . however this is also where the movie is let down . the movie spends too much time focusing on the love affair between winston and julia  which frankly isn  t what orwell was writing about . he was writing about a harrowing future  about how ingsoc build up a mans beliefs and then shatter them all in the name of him being made to love big brother . the movie skips over what is essentially the most important part of the book  winstons coming to terms with his position in life and the world  and his re  education via o  brien .  br    br   the comment on imdb at the moment states that the movie sticks to the book is completely incorrect . julia is not present when winston visits o  brien  they do not commit themselves to goldstien  s brotherhood and confess their crimes . there is no obvious mention of the initial instances where winston finds the article with the unpersons but it does get mentioned near the end  if you have not read the book it is completely confusing .  br    br   a terrible screenplay  which some excellent acting cannot rescue . michael radford seems to have completely missed the point orwell was trying to make  and the electronica sound track is frankly terrible .  ,0
the psychology of this movie is really weird to try and figure out . its often billed as an anti  rpg movie  but its really not that simple . here are come apparent contradictions that make me wonder just what  if anything  they  re trying to say about gaming .  br    br   they laboriously introduce all the characters home lives by way of introduction  all of them having parents who are divorced  alcoholic  and totally out of touch with their lives except for the times they  re harshly pressuring them to succeed . tom hanks is arguably the worst off  having just failed out of another school and still dealing with a brother who disappeared and may be dead .  br    br   its mentioned a couple of times that they play the game to work through problems in their real lives . and sure enough  at the end  when they go to see robbie  hanks   they  re all happy and well  adjusted  embarking on their adult careers  problems solved  games put away  daniel doesn  t even want to design computer games any more   and even robbie  s mother  who  s been constantly drunk and dissatisfied  is suddenly the happy homemaker  looking fresh and bright and arranging flowers .  br    br   sure  jj suddenly  and quite cheerfully it seems  decides to commit suicide  but the reason seems to be entirely because he  s a lonely boy genius who can  t get a date  and not because his character dies  as in the famous jack chick tract  which happens afterward anyways  and it almost seems like he does it on purpose so he can end daniels game and get everyone to come play his . in fact  the prospect of live  action role playing in the caverns seems to be the only thing that saves him from killing himself   and in what may be the coolest tableau scene in the whole movie  kate  looking very fetching in chain mail  looks right at the camera and says something like   the scariest monsters are the ones in our own minds .   br    br   the biggest fantasy element in this movie is the two muggers passing up the rich couple so they can rob the dirty  homeless  looking guy of his magic beans . the recurring theme  a  the way we were  for the   s  might have been poignant at the end  but as a way to kick off a movie is downright depressing and seems out of place . and for one final mystery  our hero  wearing full pardu regalia  has a psychotic break  becomes his character completely and embarks on his quest  so of course the first thing he does is change into    century street clothes .  br    br   so maybe the movie  s irrational  but i guess its dealing with an irrational topic . in those days a circle of kids with dice and pencils was regarded as tainted and possibly possessed  and you could go insane if they spoke their mumbo  jumbo at you . the anti  game paranoia is pretty much summed up in the first scene  where the reporter asks the cop whats going on  the cop says a kids lost in the tunnels and there  s a chance mazes and monsters is somehow involved . the reporter admits to being vaguely familiar with the game  although he allows his own children to play it   then turns to the camera and reels off a polished spiel that blames the game for everything and admits no possibility of another explanation . in the end  its no masterpiece  but interesting as made  for  tv movies go .  ,0
orca is not exactly bad  but it  s not really richard harris  s finest hour either . as a demented  ahab  like fisherman  harris gets into a game of death with a vengeful killer whale after killing the whale  s  wife  and unborn child . charlotte rampling plays a whale expert who gets involved with harris . she yells at him a lot about how important it is to leave nature alone . he doesn  t listen and somehow ends up in the arctic battling the revenge crazed whale . there are no special effects to speak of except for what looks like a round mirror for a whale  s eye    there are endless shots of harris reflected in the eye so the audience understands that the whale knows who he is . bo derek  as one of harris  s crew has a particularly unpleasant run in with the orca and most of the supporting cast  including robert carridine  will sampson and keenan wynn don  t fare very well either .  ,0
very good drama about a young girl who attempts to unravel a series of horrible crimes . she enlists the aid of a police cadet  and they begin running down a series of clues which lead to a traveling carny worker with a long police record . an ending which is guaranteed to keep you on the edge of your seat .  ,1
okay  i  m not going to critique this film in depth . i note the many elogious reviews in advance of me  and as i generally like maria de medeiros  i have been long hesitant to make a disparaging comment  and in such fashion nearly a year has passed . but each time i see that dvd on my shelf  i sense an inner groan . anyway  let the elogious voices override me  but for other cinephiles like me  beware .  br    br   expressed in simplest and gentlest terms  here  s my stance  br    br   the political turmoil and overthrow providing the backdrop for this film also served as a backdrop for a certain period of my life  via newspapers i read daily in my local middle  european pub . at that time  i followed the newsreports  but never fully grasped what the heck was transpiring . the reporters tended to report either in non  partisan terms  or with a conservatism which frowned upon any groups disturbing the peace or fomenting rebellion against the establishment . those were times when other winds of unrest swirled through paris  berlin  prague  and various places in the u . s .  all of whose issues i understand clearly at the time  but dictatorship or not  my papers tended to treat the govermentment of portugal simply as the establishment  not as a well  fleshed out  evil empire   to use flippant star war terms .  br    br   so  week after week  i read of disturbances  but never found an intelligent editorial that might provide the history behind them  or evaluate the practices and social  economic impacts of the dictatorship  etc .  br    br   so  in purchasing this film  i had at least two hopes to finally understand the details leading up to the social unrest  and to enjoy a well  conceived drama . this film gave me neither .  br    br   the film presupposes that viewers already have ample knowledge and deep emotions regarding the historical facts . and the drama  well  as i said  i want to encourage maria de medeiros and the portugues film industry  but  it was trite and shallow .  br    br   i obtained my copy of the dvd from france   selection official cannes      un certain regard  . the box shows smiling clean  shaven actors  the lead giving the victory sign in a fashion that reminds me more of the playboy bunny . after seeing the work  i wondered what the french could have thought of it  though as a shallow piece of  cinema verite   with sensitive ethnic content  i can understand their natural inclination to praise it for its  honesty  but . . .  br    br   look at the back of the box  un regard chaleuruex sur la revolution   a warm regard  try describing allende  s overthrown and murder with a a  warm regard   try it with czechoslovakia in      try it with the whole line  up of overthrows  and civil rebellions   br    br   another review maria de medeiros a renoue  avec son pays  son enfance et son histoire .  rubbish  rubbish  rubbish  at least for me .  br    br   i love portugal . in all of europe  lisbon  barcelona and prague are my favorite cities . but my love for a city and a country doesn  t flesh out a vacuous film . i  ll hang on to my ancient vhs tapes of capas negras and a cancao de lisboa  meanwhile  i  m stuck with a zone  by the above title that might as well go in the trash .  ,0
  no spoilers  just plot details  i can  t understand such hatred for this episode . you want to watch a bad episode of smallville  watch subterranean  now there  s a sack of crap . tom welling gives a good performance  i don  t say that very often   and michael rosenbaum is great  but he is most of the time . the alternate universe scenario seems eerily realistic . the martian manhunter  who previously appeared in  static   returns and tells clark that the doctor that is the head of the insane asylum where they are being held at is actually a phantom from the phantom zone  and if clark wants to return to his universe  he must kill him . an overall great episode  with good acting and a decent pace .  ,1
probably the best picture producers releasing corp ever made  this little horror piece rivets the attention from first to last . director frank wisbar obviously knows a good story when he writes one and what  s more important he knows how to realize its full shock potential on the screen . not only is the plot involving and the characters fascinatingly drawn  but the setting is absolutely out of this world  just about all the action takes place either at night or in the middle of a clinging  pervasive fog . this chilling atmosphere is augmented by wisbar  s inventive direction and the wholly convincing performances he has drawn from all his players . the lovely rosemary la planche makes an ideal heroine  beautiful  spirited yet vulnerable . robert barrat delivers his usual no  nonsense  straight  down  the  line portrait of the local bigwig  though it  s hard to believe that the personable  good  looking guy who plays his son is none other than the later dullsville writer  director blake edwards .  ,1
this video contains an outsmart way to confuse and manipulate americans about islam . it  s a pity that the people who did it really believe that american people is so dumb to believe in it  perhaps  as an american citizen  every person must protest against this kind of crap . if you want to know the truth about islam  don  t let nobody tell you . . . the quran is public  you can read it by yourself and decide if what they say it  s true or false . . .  br    br   the video uses a lot of audiovisual strategies directed to manipulate and associate things that are not even related . the music used at some points prepare the public to hate what they see  even if they don  t really understand what  s going on in there . they use images that are misplaced from their original content .  br    br   to end the comment i would like to make a reflexion . . . don  t you think you can do the same exact movie with every religion in the world   ,0
sunshine is a european import set in hungary between     and      it  s the epic story of hungarian jews  the sonnenschein family . this name literally translates to sunshine . the family has humble beginnings  then is prosperous  becomes upwardly mobile  changes it  s name  and hopes to assimilate into hungarian society so successive generations can advance professionally . the story is told through the eyes of the eldest son in each of three generations ralph fiennes plays these three roles . for those who missed the ww  ii and the holocaust in europe  the sonnenschein  approach to life doesn  t work out very well .  br    br   sunshine is being acclaimed as an artistic success  but it is an opportunity missed . the story line  dominated by world history  is predictable and transparent this is reinforced with voice cover narration and newsreel footage . the family  plot  lurches from one predictable event ie . the hapsburgs  ww  i  ww  ii  fascism  communism  etc .  to the next with little continuity  depth or detail . the jewish assimilation theme is unfocused  and important sub  themes the  secret  diary and family philosophy that could have given the family character and credibility are l ost until the very end . alternatively  the filmmakers provide generation continuity using common themes of incest  infidelity .  br    br   ralph fiennes exhibits flashes of brilliance but his performance is far from award winning material . the   for   casting format is a viewer distraction and feels more like a cheap cinema gimmick than good theater . sunshine is basically hungarian  history channel  material . it has the look and feel of winds of war morphed with forrest gump morphed with something about sex .  br    br    ,0
good films cannot solely be based on a beautiful garden and a hill top . surprised to see it has won two awards . extremely overrated . i first saw that kind of films from china  visually stunning but also with really something captivating to say  well  more than   years ago and i  m sure there are still more coming up . this is not one of them  i  m afraid .  ,0
i have read the short story by norman maclean  and the movie did justice to norman maclean  s writing . my husband tends to reread it occasionally  and i myself have read it over and scenes of the movie keeps coming to mind . we have videos of many of redford s movies and we have watched  a river runs through it  many times . redford is part of the  famdamily  as he is always around . we never get tired of redford  s perception of norman maclean writings  and the beauty of montana . the script reminds me very much of my own upbringing as my father had the same calling as mr . maclean  s father . according to  a river runs through it    methodists are baptists who can read   a line which by the way is not in the short story  but i think that is a funny line  my husband and i are well  read baptists   br    br   i have heard a movie critic state that the pace of this movie is too slow . i disagree . as one search for inner peace  this is the type of movie that will make you contemplate the beauty of nature in three  four rhythm of the metronome . the photography is outstanding  the acting is great . i love the scene where norman and paul as boys talked and wondered whether one could be a fly fisher or a boxer  then as adult paul played by brad pitt  se  ven  is the  perfect guy  who needs help with his alcoholism but will not accept it . the same applies to neal burns  who uses worms as bait  he also needed help but would not accept the fact that he needed help . the scene where paul refuses to eat oatmeal and the entire family has to wait an eternity to say grace  finally after hours  they all kneel around the table to say  grace   and they all leave . but the oatmeal stayed on the plate  that scene where the two love birds and their tattoos on their posteriors  that is funny  the sunburn  the drive back home where jessie burns  emily lloyd  decides to go via the train line  beautiful dialogue when norman proposes to jessie because he wants her to come to chicago with him   br    br   redford himself does a superb job as a narrator . i could not stop myself from comparing brad to the young redford  barefoot in the park  . the nominated director  producer  actor  is a visionary who deserves to be praised for his advancement not only in the cinema in the us but around the world . i am glad to live in nineteen hundred because i have seen the beginning of the black and white television  the movies and all the technology and special effects  to be able to watch videos at home and to live in the same century as redford because i have had the chance to see his works . redford needs no special effects to show us the beauty of montana in this masterpiece . the river to me means that line that separates life from death  memories and realities . redford shows the hands of the creator so magnificently and a river runs through it .  ,1
while the movie does feel a bit long at times  it is well worth it . gordon directs in a style that reminds you of vonneguts writing styles . merciless  thoughtful  ironic  quirky  and dark  this is a film which will stay with you for quite a while  begging for answers to impossible questions . nolte  goodman  and arkin are all incredible . sheryl lee is wonderful as well  in a role that will remind us lynch fans of her laura  maddy days . do not miss this one   ,1
this movie has many problem associated with it that makes it come off like a low budget class project from someone in film school . i have to give it credit on its campiness though . many times throughout the movie i found myself laughing hysterically . it was so bad at times that it was comical  which made it a fun watch .  br    br   if you  re looking for a low  grade slasher movie with a twist of psychological horror and a dash of campy ridiculousness  then pop a bowl of popcorn  invite some friends over  and have some fun .  br    br   i agree with other comments that the sound is very bad . dialog is next to impossible to follow much of the time and the soundtrack is kind of just there .  ,0
when i heard patrick swayze was finally returning to his acting career with king solomon  s mines i was very excited . i was expecting a great indiana jones type action adventure . what i got was a  hour long  with commercials  epic that was very slow . the second and third hour could have been dropped altogether and the story would not have suffered for it . the ending was good  no spoilers here  but i was still left wanting more . well all a guy can do is prey that swayze does  roadhouse   so he can get back into the action genre that made him famous . until than if your a fan of king solomon  s mines than read the book or watch the     version with richard chamberlain and sharon stone which is also not very good but its only and hour and forty minutes of your life gone instead of  hours .  ,1
here goes the perfect example of what not to do when you have a great idea . that is the problem isn  t  the concept is fresh and full of potential  but the script and the execution of it lacks any real substance . it should grab you from the start and then pull a little on your emotions  get you interested and invested in the characters . this movie doesn  t have what it takes to take off and sustain flight  and here is why . first you don  t really care about the characters because they are not presented in a way that people can relate to  i mean this is not superman or mission impossible here  it  s suppose to be about normal people put in a stressful situation . they are not believable in the way they act and interact . example  jeffrey combs as a cop over chewing is gum  frowning and looking intense all the time isn  t the way to go here . i mean what is that   he looks like he  s on the toilet or something . i loved him in re  animator and the way he was playing the intense  neurotic  unappreciated medical genius was right on the money . but not for this  he tries too hard to over compensate by looking so intense and on edge but in a still mild neurotic manner  it  s not natural  i  m surprised he didn  t dislocate his jaw during filming . the movie is basically on life support  it barely has a pulse and it kept me waiting for something that would never come .  ,0
there are some movies you just know they are going to be bad from frame one . even if you were totally oblivious of ed wood  s work  one look at that commentator from  plan  from outer space  and you just know you are not gonna see the next cinematic masterpiece . just like that  when i saw the first shot of uwe bolls masterpiece  house of dead   with that guy sitting at the front of the house starting his introduction while trying desperately to sound like he just arrived from sin city  i knew i  m in for a helluva ride .  br    br   so  the movie starts like this  first the lead character says that everybody else is going to die . you know  to keep you wandering . then he starts introducing the rest of the characters with lines like  karma . . thinks she  s foxy brown  or  alicia . . my ex . . we broke up recently . . i had to study and she had to fence  . no  i  m not kidding .  br    br   anyway  this bunch of    somethings who couldn  t act their way out of a wet paper  bag are going to the  rave of the century   rave in question being a few tents  a port  a  potty and a shoddy stage located on small island in the middle of the pacific . our gang missed the ferry  but thankfully will find a way to get there  the way being a fisher  boat ran by kirk  cpt kirk  get it  man  whoever wrote this script is a genius  and his sidekick who is a bastard child of simpsons  cpt mcallister and that hook killer who knows what you did last summer .  br    br   to make the long story short  the gang gets to the island  finds nobody there except some bloody t  shirts and then decide to run the hell away from there . no wait  they do not  they actually get all happy and like cos there  s free booze .  br    br   with that scene the movie hits rock bottom and then against all odds proceeds to go further downhill . some guys in rubber suits start running around  there is some screaming and shooting  our gang goes to some house to meet some other gang  they go out of the house  meet cpt kirk and some police woman  who between them have about    pounds of weapons  and then decide to go back to the house . somewhere along the line they transform into a s . w . a . t . team  enter the matrix  the rubber  suit guys start multiplying like bacteria and i start to cry because i actually paid to see this . to add insult to the injury  every few minutes there are shots from the video game this crap is based on and there is a cute game  over cut  scene for a few characters when they die .  br    br   i seriously hate this movie . it doesn  t even fit in that famed  so bad it  s good  category . it  s just plain bad . the script is bad  the zombies are awful  there is no tension  lines are bad  actors are bad . . the list just goes on .  br    br   you will probably want to see this movie just because of its reputation of being awful . don  t . there are bad movies that deserve to be watched . this is not one of them .  ,0
this show has been my escape from reality for the past ten years . i will sadly miss it . although atlantis has filled the hole a small bit .  br    br   the last ever episode of sg   on television anyway  was beautifully done . robert wrote something that felt close to reality . as though he was trying to explain what it was like on the set of the show .  everyone working closely together for such a long time there are bound to up  s and downs . but over the years they  ve turned into a family  . i thought this was a wonderful way to end despite anyone else  s criticisms .  br    br   sg  was something special and time and time again it took me across thresholds of disbelief and amazement . the wonderful characters  stories  directors  writers . from episode one i was hooked . the blend of action  science  drama and especially comedy worked so well that made me keep wanting more .  br    br   there are no real words in which to completely express what this show meant to me . i can only thank those who kept the show so fresh and entertaining for so many years . it has inspired me to do many things that i thought was impossible .  br    br   i look forward to the movies next year and i really hope there will be a number of them . i never want the show to die .  br    br   stargate sg              ,1
this may not be war  peace  but the two academy noms wouldn  t have been forthcoming if it weren  t for the genius of james wong howe . . .  br    br   this is one of the few films i  ve fallen in love with as a child and gone back to without dissatisfaction . whether you have any interest in what it offers fictively or not  bbc is a visual feast .  br    br   i  m not saying it  s his best work  i  m no expert there for sure . but the look of this movie is amazing . i love everything about it elsa lanchester  the cat  the crazy hoo  doo  the retro  downtown  ness but the way it was put on film is breathtaking .  br    br   i even like the inconsistencies pointed out on this page above  and the  special effects  that seem backward now . it all creates a really consistent world .  ,1
this german documentary  in english  is about a scottish environmental sculptor named andy goldsworthy . he makes art from objects he finds in nature . for example  early in the film we see him taking sections of icicles and  gluing  them together with a little moisture into a serpentine shape that seems to repeatedly go through a vertical rock .  br    br   of course  the icicles melt  but that transience is a part of most of goldsworthy  s work . he goes to a site and gets a feeling for it  deciding intuitively what to make that day . he talks of having a  dialog  with the rocks and other materials that he works with  attempting to work with rather than against them . it might be stones  or flowers  or leaves  or sticks . the sculpture might last for minutes or years  or might not even last long enough to be completed and photographed . the work seems to be more of a process than a goal .  br    br   the film  and the work  is beautiful  inspiring  and thought provoking . it moves pretty slowly  which is appropriate for the material  but you should be sure to go when you have had a good night  s sleep . but do go if you have the opportunity .  br    br   search the web for some other pages about andy goldsworthy or to read about his local sculpture at stanford university . there are also several books available with photographs of his sculptures .  br    br   my thoughts skip reading this part if you want to find what this film means to you completely independently . i recall a couple of ideas that occurred to me while watching the film which i thought i would share for those of you still reading . first  the transitory nature of much of andy goldsworthy  s work reminded me of the natural ebb and flow of human life . we  re born  we live  and eventually we die . that  s natural  and that  s also naturally a part of goldsworthy  s art .  br    br   the other thought was to be awestruck with the way that goldsworthy has managed to integrate his passion and his work so thoroughly into his life . most of us have work which is tolerated at best  a life which we hardly notice living  and passions which we really mean to spend more time on  if we even remember what they are . andy goldsworthy has managed to create an amalgam of all of these aspects of his life that looks like it works very well  and is nourishing for him and those around him . wow .  br    br   seen on          .  ,1
this is awesomely bad and awesomely embarassing for a canadian . we grow good wine . our writers and poets are among the world  s best . the national ballet is rated among the top five companies in the world . but we make bloody awful movies  this one isn  t especially bad . it  s especially typical and typically bad  shot in two bit hotels and public parks with thin direction  high school level acting and  gee whiz . . . lets see what this button on the camera does    photography . if michael moriarity was so intent on doing a jack nicholson impersonation  couldn  t he at least have done a good jack nicholson impersonation  and if the movie was shot in vancouver  truly one of the loveliest cities on earth and also a centre of yacht building  part of the  plot   why in god  s name do we let that endemic canadian inferiority complex dictate that it be disguised as seattle    not only am i mad about this film  i  m embarassed and more than a little ashamed . the australians turn out some splendid stuff . we produce pretentious second rate piffle . gawd       ,0
does any one know what the  sports cars were  i think robert stack  s might have been a masseratti . rock hudson  s character told his father he was taking a job in iraq  isn  t that timely  i have had dorthy malone in my spank bank most of my life  maybe this was the film that impressed me . loren bacall sure did have some chops in this film and probably out  acted malone but malones  s part made a more sensational impact so she got the oscar for best supporting role . was loren  s part considered a leading role  old man hadley character was was probably a pretty common picture of tycoons of his era in that he was a regular guy who made it big in an emerging industry but in building a whole town he had forgotten his children to have his wife bring them up . in time  being widowed he realized that they were all he really had and they were spoiled rotten  looking for attention  so rather than try to relate to his children he blew his head off . an ancient morality tale . but seriously  what were those sports cars   ,1
i don  t  know . . . maybe it  s because i  m brazilian but all that stuff was too much . too much love for the music  too much parties  too much contrast between the nice lives of the main characters  come on  it  s not so sad  and the aspect of the city shown by the director . everything looks too fake to me the families  the relationships  the music  the  happiness  . it simply sells a little taste of fake latinamerican culture . i must be honest it did seduce me a little  but who would not be seduced by that fake lives made of nice music  sex and parties  i  m not that stupid what kind of world is this one in which people do not suffer of diarrhea  profound sadness and stds  i liked the scene with caridad  s mother phone call and the discussion about the contract with all the musicians and the spanish people .  ,0
this isn  t the comedic robin williams  nor is it the quirky  insane robin williams of recent thriller fame . this is a hybrid of the classic drama without over  dramatization  mixed with robin  s new love of the thriller . but this isn  t a thriller  per se . this is more a mystery  suspense vehicle through which williams attempts to locate a sick boy and his keeper .  br    br   also starring sandra oh and rory culkin  this suspense drama plays pretty much like a news report  until william  s character gets close to achieving his goal .  br    br   i must say that i was highly entertained  though this movie fails to teach  guide  inspect  or amuse . it felt more like i was watching a guy  williams   as he was actually performing the actions  from a third person perspective . in other words  it felt real  and i was able to subscribe to the premise of the story .  br    br   all in all  it  s worth a watch  though it  s definitely not friday  saturday night fare .  br    br   it rates a  .     from . . .  br    br   the fiend  .  ,1
so what constitutes a real independent film  in a day and age where the latest fad of mainstream hollywood is to appear rugged and cutting edge  i  m sorry to say that what the general public tends to perceive as independent film is usually nothing more than a clever marketing ploy .  br    br   which is why we should be glad that films like  hatred of a minute  exist . across the board  this film makes a point out of contradicting its own template  indie horror film  . love it or hate it   hatred  isn  t afraid of being what it is  and in watching this film  you get the real sense that kallio  the director  didn  t just make this film to spray fake blood all over the place  he  s in this to tell stories . good ones . you may find this film in the horror film section of your video store  but don  t be fooled  this story is also about love  about good people pushed over the edge  and that oh  so  distant light at the end of the tunnel .  br    br   if you expect smut  or an evil dead ripoff  stay away from this film . but if you dig the finer points of the horror  suspense genres  check this film out .  br    br   yes . bruce campbell did produce this movie  and i  m sure he  s proud to tell anyone that it  s not  evil dead  . bruce has never tried to bank on his  ash  image  and it  s obvious that he didn  t get involved with  hatred  so that it could do so either .  br    br   my advice  though  to all dead  ites rabidly devouring anything issued by mr . campbell is to check this film out anyway and see what else mr . kallio and mr . campbell are trying to show you .  br    br   the acting is well done  although nothing about this film is oscar caliber  perhaps intentionally   it  s good to see compassionate performances in a horror film . so often  actors in films such as these don  t even seem to try  with  hatred   it seemed as though all the actors took thier charecters very seriously  never resorting to typical horror  film campiness .  br    br   technically   hatred  is about as competent as indie film gets . the editing is fast paced  the cinematography is good given the budget  and  hatred  keeps a quick pace  without any bog  down points or bad anti  climaxes .  br    br   all in all  hatred may not have the glossed over look of all those multi  million dollar fake indies  but personally  i don  t see a problem with that . it  s a film by folks who actually care about the medium . people who reached into thier broke ass pockets  pulled out thier nickles and dimes  threw caution to the wind and made a damn good movie .  br    br   check this one out .  ,1
i haven  t seen much german comedy  but if this film is anything to go by  i  m compelled to see more  the simple but effective storyline takes two very different people on a trip from germany to italy after eva  an unemployed mother of two  discovers that her artist husband is having an affair with the wife of a wealthy lawyer . i won  t reveal anything further  but what results is a very funny series of events with the perfect conclusion . my interest in international cinema has expanded since i first saw this film . i recommend it to anyone  any adult . . . don  t let the inclusion of the young children fool you into thinking it  s a family film  who love comedy  even those unfamiliar with the language .  ,1
i don  t know what i missed here  but i can  t believe all these positive comments by so many people on this film . i thought it was silly  and a bit over the top . i did like the performances of gregg henry and michael rooker  however the others were just . . . boring .  br    br   now i like b movies  i really do  but this was a bit further down the alphabet for me . i saw someone compare the humor and horror in this to  army of darkness  and  shaun of the dead   as well as  on par with the re  animator  . you must be joking . i didn  t find this film funny  it tried  it did make an effort   possibly too much of an effort   but it failed in my opinion . by the time i was hit with the  rd or  th one  liner i was rolling my eyes and checking my watch .  br    br   there were definitely homages made to several other films  which is always cool  kind of like an inside joke for us horror fans . but here it may have just been a lack of original thought . admittedly there were some nice special effects  good gore  but that can  t carry an entire movie . the mutated grant looked like a cross between jabba the hut  and in the early stages of mutation  chet from  weird science   after he was turned into the monster  and one of the alien creature  children from  the explorers  . it just didn  t work . i thought it looked like something some kid from grade  art class could have designed . then there was brenda  the woman that grant impregnated and chained up in the barn . when help finally arrived she looked like a giant tick waiting to be popped . the design once again was totally unimaginative . a round flesh colored balloon with a face in the middle . yawn  br    br   now about the zombies  the more movies i see with zombies in them these days the more i wish george a . romero had a patent on them and was the only writer  director allowed to make movies about them . he  s the only person so far to do it right  with the exception of edgar wright and simon pegg  but that was a comedy  . oh  and danny boyle  but they were a different style of zombie . maybe mr . romero has ruined any zombie film for me due to his ingenious ability to get his actors to moan  groan and shamble about as if their joints are dried up and lacking even a drop of synovial fluid  and their muscles are fighting the effects caused by rigor mortis that had started to set in right before they were re  animated . the people of  wheelsy  just didn  t have the proper motivation . . . they were horrible zombies .  br    br   so in the end i give  slither  a   for a couple of laughs and a few nice gore scenes .  ,0
  once in the life  is a very good movie . however it  s not good for everybody  due to the extensive use of vulgar language and the violence of some of the situations . the movie manages to represent in an anecdotic  believable way the  life  in nyc neighborhoods where drug problems are important . this depiction is in turn used as the decor for a most thoughtful and suspenseful drama backed up by powerful dialogs  however i had a hard time understanding some of them because english is not my mother tongue . on video it  s ok  . there is a little overplay sometimes  but i think it fits quite well to the general orientation fishburne gave to the movie  which gives matter for reflexion more than just being a good style exercise  notably in the time  action management . the characters  even though not simple  are easy to relate to and actors do a fine job at impersonating them . by the way i much enjoyed the soundtrack  b . marsalis  . if you  re not too prude  you should enjoy seeing that movie once  twice  three times . i rated the movie     .  ,1

legendary movie producer walt disney brought three of the world  s greatest fairy tales to the screen . they remain among the most popular animated films of all time . the first was his groundbreaking classic  snow white and the seven dwarfs  released in     . the last was the then  under appreciated  sleeping beauty  which made it  s debut in     . in between these two was perhaps his most satisfying adaptation of a classic fairy tale  cinderella        . of the three films   cinderella  is the one most faithful to its origins . ironically  unlike  snow white   which for better or worse  became for many the definitive version of the story .  cinderella  did not follow the same path . although it was a hit and  like  snow white   was responsible for restoring the dwindling disney fortunes  it never achieved the same audience recognition which it certainly deserved . disney  for once  did himself proud  electing not to tamper with a classic  instead elaborating and adding substance to the tale  rather than rewriting it for the screen . the result was enchanting .  br    br   a combination of superb animation  in beautifully soft technicolor  and the perfect voice talents brought the story to life with a radiance that endures to this day . ilene woods  who was a radio performer  recorded demonstration discs of the songs as a favor to the authors of the material  al hoffman  mack david  and jerry livingston . when disney heard them  he knew he had found his cinderella . and indeed he had . woods heartfelt renditions of  a dream is a wish your heart makes    so this is love  and  oh sing sweet nightingale  are perfect . eleanor audley  who would go on to voice maleficent in  sleeping beauty   masterfully captured the icy cruelty of the stepmother  while rhoda williams and lucille bliss were convincingly nasty stepsisters . luis van rooten admirably performed as both the king and the grand duke  and james macdonald was endearing as both jaq and gus  cinderella  s devoted mice . william phipps has little dialog as the prince  future talk show host mike douglas provided his singing voice  but film  and disney  veteran  verna felton was born to play the fairy godmother  and she made the best number   the oscar  nominated  bibbidi  bobbidi  boo   her own show  stopper .  br    br   among the artists responsible for the  look  of the film  was mary blair  whose inspired use of color was greatly admired by disney . her elegant french  period backgrounds add tremendously to the quality of the movie . but  most important of all  are the believable characters   from cinderella  right down to lucifer  the stepmother  s deliciously evil cat . they bring both life and vibrancy to the often told story  something very difficult to create in an animated film .  br    br   in conjunction with the film  s    year anniversary   and  not so coincidentally  the coming holiday season   cinderella  has just been released on a special edition dvd . it simply has never looked better . the fully restored film must be seen to be appreciated   suffice it to say  it looks wonderful . an enhanced stereo soundtrack has been added  and serves the music well . the dvd extras  now a standard part of disney platinum editions  are too numerous to list here  but as usual  some are directed towards children  some are slanted to adults  and the rest fall somewhere in between . but real fans will want to get the deluxe gift set  because  along with an actual cell from the film and eight character sketches  it includes a     page hardback book  which not only incorporates most of the material found in the book with the     special edition home video release  but much more as well . as usual for disney   cinderella  will only be available for a limited time . so  if like me  you are a  cinderella  lover  get it now  this edition is truly a  dream come true .   ,1
second  feature concerns a young woman in london desperate for a job  happy to accept live  in secretarial position with an elderly woman and her son . thrillers about people being held in a house against their will always make me a little uneasy   i end up feeling like a prisoner too   but this rather classy b  film is neither lurid nor claustrophobic . it  s far  fetched and unlikely  but not uninteresting  and our heroine  nina foch  is quick on her feet . rehashing this in      as  dead of winter   proved not to be wise  as the plot  elements are not of the modern  day .  julia ross  is extremely compact  too short at   minutes   but it stays the course nicely until a too  rushed climax  which feels a little sloppy .  from   ,1

it  s somewhat telling that most of the great reviews for the film on imdb all come from people who have only reviewed one film in their entire imdb career and yes you  ve guessed it  that film is  parasomnia  . i  ve often suspected suspiciously good reviews on imdb for what turns out to be an anything but good films as underhand marketing  but it seems fairly transparent in this case .  br    br   that  s not to say parasomnia is terrible  but it stops well short of being the good or great film it had the potential to be .  br    br   on the plus side  it has a great baddie in patrick kilpatrick who does a brilliant job projecting menacing and evil  i could easily see him having what it takes to play a truly memorable baddie on a par with hannibal lecter . there are some beautiful visuals in the dream sequences  in fact if the film had decided to explore that terrain more it might have been something better . the actual concept of devious misuse of hypnosis is great too .  br    br   although i understand suspension of disbelief is necessary for immersion in any good story  it  s the mark of a good story that it succeeds in letting you do that . if you find yourself being annoyed at what you find illogical or just plain silly  then the story is losing you and that  s what kept happening to me with this film . other reviewers have mentioned this here and i don  t want to get into spoiler territory  but i will say the setup at the ending was particularly ludicrous and disappointing  not too mention the varying mental age of a character that is only supposed to have experienced a few years of life .  br    br   all in all  there is the germ of a great idea here in diabolically misused hypnotism  but sadly this film fails to realise it into anything special .  ,0
carol  s journey is a pleasure to watch for so many reasons . the acting of clara lago is simply amazing for someone so young  and she is one of those special actors who can say say much with facial expressions . director imanol urbibe presents a tight and controlled film with no break in continuity  thereby propelling the plot at a steady pace with just enough suspense to keep one wondering what the nest scene will bring . the screenplay of angel garcia roldan is story telling at its best  which  it seems  if the major purpose for films after all . the plot is unpredictable  yet the events as they unravel are completely logical . perhaps the best feature of this film if to tell a story of the spanish civil war as it affected the people . it was a major event of the   th century  yet hardly any americans know of it . in fact  in   years of university teaching  i averaged about one student a semester who had even heard of it  much less any who could say anything comprehensive about it   and the overwhelming number of students were merit scholars  all of which speaks to the enormous amount of censorship in american education . so  in one way  this film is a good way to begin a study of that event  keeping in mind that when one thread is pulled a great deal of history is unraveled . the appreciation of this film is  therefore  in direct relation to the amount of one  s knowledge . to view this film as another coming of age movie is the miss the movie completely . the left elbow index considers seven aspects of film   acting  production sets  character development  plot  dialogue  film continuity  and artistry   on a scale for   for very good   for average  and  for needs help . carol  s journey is above average on all counts  excepting dialogue which is rated as average . the lei average for this film is  .   raised to a   when equated to the imdb scale . i highly recommend this film for all ages .  ,1
it was by accident that i was scanning the tv channels and found this wonderful film about two beautiful human beings who become attracted to each other in a very innocent and virgin like approach to each other . ethan hawke  jesse   tape     and julie delpy  celine   er    tv series  nicole  . this gal and guy  will warm your very heart and soul and make you think deeply into your past relationships and how you really wish you had followed your hearts strings with a guy or gal you deep down loved and lost track of over the years . jesse and celine have great conversation  and deep eye contact with a great magnetic explosion between the two of them . i am looking forward to the sequel to this film in     and if you have viewed this film  you will feel the same way .  ,1
i was really looking forward to this movie based on the previews and press it received  but after viewing it i was terribly disappointed . slums is a totally unfunny film mixed with a todd solondz type of disturbing family reality sans todd  s brand of humor . the story drags along and each scene is worse than the last . maybe i missed the point  but if this film is an example of every girl  s growing up experience i am glad to be a man .  ,0
there are some things i can never understand . such as this movie . what if i were to create a really really cheap and crappy looking dino and crocodile polygon model in maya and then proceed to cut and paste that into an amateur video clip having people scream and getting eaten by the same thing  how can anyone even believe that an utterly fake cgi dinocroc that looks completely out of place  would influence the events in this movie  i know that its b  grade  low budget and all but the producers could do better than making a piece of crap that no one will ever seen see or sit through . it just does  nt make sense . are people really so stupid that they would sit through this  apparently so . for laughs  no  this thing isn  t even worth laughing at .  ,0
after playing a nymphomaniac in written on the wind  dorothy malone finally said good  bye to her sweet sister  wife roles and demonstrated an ability to play mantraps with the best of them . she and gloria grahame played the same sort of tramps   and for her efforts here in a very manipulative role  malone won a best supporting actress oscar .  br    br   the film she  s in is not quite up to oscar standards  but it is a strong enough melodrama under douglas sirk  s capable hands . there  s an almost noirish look to the explosive opening scene and it sets the tone for the rest of the sudsy fireworks in a story that has rock hudson  lauren bacall  robert stack and dorothy malone as its headliners .  br    br   domestic squabbles among the inhabitants of a wealthy family with an oil background are the primary focus of the drama  with the accent on the strong supporting players  stack and malone . both of them seize the opportunity with both hands and stack  too  should have been awarded for his sterling job as the weak  alcoholic brother driven to desperation by his own wild motives .  br    br   the nominal stars have less impressive work to do  but do it with their usual skill and conviction   hudson and bacall . they play their more sympathetic roles with quiet authority and understanding .  br    br   the use of color is particularly striking  as it usually is in a sirk film  and yet it doesn  t preclude me from thinking of the film as a technicolor film noir in the vein of leave her to heaven .  br    br   well worth watching with some interesting performances from the entire cast .  ,1
a good film  and one i  ll watch a number of times . rich  the previous commenter  is right there is much more going on here than is clear from the title boards  and i have to wonder how much has suffered in translation . were there more in the original  or was a native  language audience expected to lip  read more  or   since the screenplay was written by the author of the novel on which this was based   was this a currently popular story with which the audience was already very familiar  in short  very worth a look  but it probably requires more work from contemporary viewers than the original     audience had to put into it .  br    br   the alpha video release touts the new organ score  but the music is not matched to the story progression in any way . sure  it starts promisingly  but degenerates into a repetitive  phillip  glass  like monotony that reflects nothing of the action on the screen . after listening for a while  i turned off the sound and simply watched much better   ,1
i would like to know why john amos left the show  and how did he die off the show again  i couldn  t relate to everything  but sometimes they hit home with the problems they were facing . by the way  did they ever make it out of the ghetto  i think the episode with the black jesus was my favorite . we got to see them experience a few good times . something they didn  t have very often . i wish they would bring the show back . during the daytime so people can actually stay up to watch . i don  t think a movie or a new show would work . especially without the original cast . they are really what made good times goodtimes . these are my questions and comments . thank you    ,1
this is quite possibly the worst movie of all time . it stars shaquille o  neil and is about a rapping genie . apparently someone out there thought that this was a good idea and got suckered into dishing out cash to produce this wonderful masterpiece . the movie gets  out of   .  ,0
i got a dvd of  bogeyman  and this stunker was an extra feature . i assumed that it was  boogeyman ii  because it was paired with the original . but you know what they say about those who  assume   it makes an  ass   out of  u   and  me .  i had read before viewing that bii contains a lot of footage from the original and that it starred actress love . while watching  return of the boogeyman   i decided to stick around through the original footage to see the notorious death  by  toothbrush scene . before i knew it  the film was over . rip  off . i think that i thought this was bii because this has a similar title to one of bii  s alternate titles . oh well  at least this was just an extra feature  right   br    br   let me stop talking about my mistake and start talking about the movie  s mistakes . many  many  mistakes . who does this guy ulli whatever think he is  does he really think the same movie will sell in different forms . there is nothing original holding part iii up . it is basically a flashback of the original through the eyes of a psychic  who is giving us a gruelingly boring play  by  play as everything happens . that  s the movie . oh  and one death  by  stereo scene  but you can read that off someone else  s review . my interest in  boogeyman ii  is forever lost .  br    br   final note this is not a series of films to watch back to back .  ,0
elephant walk was a thoroughly dull film and i really was quite happy when finally a herd of elephants stormed through the mansion and ended this film . considering the money and cast  you  d sure expect the film to be a lot better  though i also question the odd casting of dana andrews as a man who is in love with elizabeth taylor . it  s not just the age difference but i just can  t see the pair as a couple . perhaps some of this may be the fault of substituting miss taylor for vivian leigh at the last minute  due to miss leigh  s deteriorating mental condition    though i also have a hard time visualizing andrews and leigh as well . in addition  for an english woman  miss taylor doesn  t even seem to try using an accent .  br    br   the film begins with peter finch and taylor meeting and marrying in england . their plan is to return to finch  s tea plantation in ceylon  sri lanka  and at first it seems like a good life . however  there are no women to talk with and the household staff seem to resent her . on top of that  once back home  finch behaves like a boorish jerk and taylor is miserable . neighbor andrews can see this and he declares his undying passion for her . however  taylor isn  t yet ready to abandon her marriage . but  through the course of the film finch treats liz more and more like an object and finally she is ready to leave . . . when out of the blue  cholera strikes the plantation . so it  s up to andrews  finch and taylor to work together to save the day   though by this point i really didn  t care  as there is absolutely no chemistry between the characters  the dialog is pretty dull and you can  t understand why taylor didn  t leave her weasel husband within days of arriving in this inhospitable hell .  br    br   the film isn  t particularly engaging or convincing and despite a decent budget by paramount  the film is a sluggish mess . i particularly was surprised that although the film appeared to be filmed on location  many scenes were clearly filmed in a studio with a rear projected  and grainy  shot that wasn  t integrated well . in one scene  for instance  taylor  finch and the lot are sitting on the veranda and the grass is bright green . then  when the picture cuts to people dancing right in front of them  the grass is brown  it  s clear they really are not in ceylon in this scene or the scene with the giant reclining buddha . my advice is to skip this one or at least keep a pot of coffee nearby to keep you awake . despite its budget  it  s just not a very good or inspired film .  br    br   by the way  could miss taylor have been pregnant during part of this film  in some scenes  particularly at the beginning  she  s wearing billowy clothes  has a double  chin and looks puffy . this isn  t a criticism   after all  women do get pregnant  but if you look carefully  you  ll see what i mean .  br    br   also by the way  the basic plot in many ways is similar to giant   a great taylor film indeed  it  s amazing how casting and decent direction can do so much .  ,0
this was a less than exciting short film i saw between features on turner classic movies recently . while the film popped out due to its very intense technicolor  the film itself just wasn  t that moving and at times the plot looked pretty cheesy   like this was made for classroom use and capturing the attention of a wider audience wasn  t even a consideration . in particular  i really hated how many times in the film things were reiterated   such as when the characters talked to her  they usually said  clara barton  instead of  ma  am    miss barton  or  clara  . plus  one sickly confederate soldier said that he was a  johnny reb  a confederate a rebel  . . .    almost like he was the cartoon character mojo jojo from the powerpuff girls . this was just sloppy writing   period .  br    br   it was interesting to see john hamilton  later   perry white  on the superman tv show  in a beard as president garfield . yep   it  s him under that beard .  ,0
the story of the film was as simple minded as its morality go find a girl  marry her  live with her happily ever after . though the film had some fine moments and turns  most of it stayed at the surface of what might have been shown in a film with the same storyline .  br    br   the baptist  mormon struggle was only touched superficially and was mocked about  probably intentionally . a more interesting story would have been a mixed couple .  br    br   if you wanna see a film which doesn  t need too much concentration  which can be watched by the whole family and which teaches your children modest and conservative values  besides the modern tolerance stuff      you will be fine with this film . might be shown at a family  home  evening . . .  ,0
hilarious  laugh out loud moments . . . and yet not a comedy . i particularly liked the planted gag of the ambulance soaking the  filthy bum  who then shouts after them in anger  you filthy bums   i mean wow  someone  s online degree in literature is paying off  the worst script imaginable  with plot introductions in an instant  ridiculous movement in the story  zero character development  even between the characters who meet . . it  s as if they all have known and trusted each other for years  dodgy voice over with added echo effects  and plot holes . . oh god are there plot holes   to be honest i write this not even having watched the entire thing  but i certainly expect the last   mins or so to not exactly enhance the already pathetic attempt in cinema . . . thank god we  ve got a good looking lead to somewhat make us forget that the film is a load of . . . well . . . use you imagination for the conclusion of that particular sentence   ,0
  presque rien  is a beautifully observed portrait of the experiences of a young french homosexual . eschewing both stereotypes and preaching  it  s a wonderfully naturalistic film  superbly acted  shot with a feel for the seaside town where the action takes place  never melodramatic but often painfully real . if anything it  s almost too realistic  as there  s little in the way of conventional plot  just scenes from a life . but the absence of conventional dramatic tension counts for less than it might in a world so subtly drawn .  presque rien  might not be the most exciting film ever made but its simple humanism serves it well compared with the pre  conceived celebratory or bigoted viewpoints that often mar treatments of this theme . worth a watch .  ,1
despite the  english  title  this seems to have little to do with devils and much more to do with a power hungry ruler who seeks the philospher  s stone  wants gold made from lead   virgin  s blood  . jacinto molina plays gilles de lancre and seems to have little issue with having people put to death when he thinks they threaten his position or when he needs virgins for their blood . he  s basically egged on by his lady love and an alchemist that he  s employed and it  s more greed and insanity that seems to be his problem than demonic possession  unfortunately  . there are parts that are at least somewhat exciting like jousting and grown men trying to knock each other down with big sticks  and the film at least has a good look to it  but otherwise there  s little about this to recommend . little in the way of gore and nothing to be afraid of at all  and most unusual  for a molina  naschy film  not really any unintentional humor . therefore   out of   .  ,0
the only show i have watched since       why did they discontinue it  it was the only show that captured the essence of hawaii and made you feel like you are a part of it all  the least they should do is release it on dvd   br    br   i checked out similar shows  but nothing has come close . the cast had incredible chemistry and i looked forward to each episode with much anticipation .  br    br   they made a big mistake by pulling that show . if anyone has any info regarding where i can obtain a dvd of north shore please post a few lines here . thanks  aloha   ,1
i don  t understand why the reviews of this film are so universally bad  unless i  m just off my rocker . i found it sick  brilliant  twisted  and psychologically sophisticated . you won  t get deeper into the mind of a criminal psychopath in a hollywood film than this one . it has layers within layers  nuanced acting by stone  and a plot that will keep you guessing even after it  s over . people need to get over the fact that sharon stone is    and that michael douglas isn  t in this one . i predict that this film will be a huge hit on dvd once people see it for themselves and stop paying attention to the drivel professional reviewers put out . give it a shot  you might be glad you did   ,1
i don  t know who sue kramer  the director of this film is  but i have a strong suspicion that a  she is a lesbian and b  she somehow shamed everyone involved in this project to participate to prove they are not homophobic .  br    br   i can imagine everyone thinking   my god  this is horrible . not funny . pedestrian . totally lame .  but keeping their mouths shut for fear they will be labeled anti  gay or they  don  t get  the gay lifestyle .  this is probably why kramer did not cast gay people to play gay people too .  anyway  it  s not even worth reviewing . the actors are all directed to play every scene completely over the top so there is no sincerity or believability in anything they do . it  s full of clichs and there is nothing about this movie that is the least bit amusing  much less funny .  br    br   i hated it and i  m not afraid to say so . too bad the gutless people who gave kramer the money to make this bomb weren  t as unbiased in their judgment .  ,0
ok . . . i watch a lot of bad movies . i pride myself on that fact . many times there are some gems in the b rated bombs . but this movie is one of the worst i have watched . i like a good horror movie . . . but one with a plot of and sense of movement . the opening scenes seemed pretty good . decent music and imagery . then it goes down hill from there . one of the main characters has a disability  ringing in the ears called tinnitus  . now this will in turn threaten to reveal his secret . they made that too much of a focus of the movie . so what he has ringing in his ears and accidentally left an ear plug somewhere where that he shouldn  t have been . no need to keep bringing it up . so this guy is having an affair with this girl and in a motel she falls and hits her head on the end table . so instead of letting everyone know of his affair he decides to dump the body . now her twin sister is trying to find out where she is and what happened to her . well after seeing her sister over and over again  as a zombie like ghost  and even pointing directly to the location of the body she finally finds her . now the body is recovered and she is set out to deal with the one and only suspect that killed her . bad thing is that she didn  t have much of a plan . only to pretend to be her twin and met the guy where the body was dumped . the idiot didn  t even believe he killed her . so all is revealed there and even though she had a gun . . . . somehow she manages to get herself strangled . so the last scenes of the movie are of the  spirits  of her and her twin walking out of the water . so you mean to tell me in this movie the bad guy wins . and not one but two innocent people die .  br    br   good things about the movie imagery  br    br   bad things about the movie music sound effects long and drawn out misdirection of plot low grade acting from some not all actors  ,0
i caught this at a test screening . all i can say is what . . . the . . . hell  this movie plays out about as smoothly as mickey mouse reading the script for  scarface .  it  s bizarre beyond making the slightest bit of sense and even if you do leave your brain in the car  the film is still so bizarre that it isn  t even funny .  br    br   the plot involves crocodile hunter steve irwin trying to  save  a crocodile which contains a cia probe . the cia comes after irwin to get their probe back  irwin mistakes them for poachers  and sets out to  stop  them .  br    br   that  s about all the story there is the rest is over  the  top lampooning of australian culture   didja see dat   and  crikey    and strangely choreographed action sequences . at one point  irwin mounts a speeding rv and knife fights with a cia agent on top of it . yes  that  s right steve irwin knife fights a guy on top of an rv . let that be your guide for this ridiculously bad film .  ,0
when i ordered this from blockbuster  s website i had no idea that it would be as terrible as it was . who knows  maybe i  d forgotten to take my add meds that day . i do know that from the moment the cast drove up in their station wagon  donned in their late    s  style wide collars  bell  bottoms and feathered hair  i knew that this misplaced gem of the disco era was glory bound for the dumpster .  br    br   the first foretelling of just how bad things were to be was the narration at the beginning  trying to explain what cosmic forces were at play to wreak havoc upon the universe  forcing polyester and porno  quality music on the would  be viewer . from the opening scene with the poorly  done effects to the  monsters  from another world and then the house which jumps from universe to universe was as achingly painful as watching an elementary school production of  the vagina monologues  .  br    br   throughout the film  the sure sign something was about to happen was when a small ship would appear . the  ship  was comprised suspiciously of what looked like old vcr and camcorder parts and would attack anyone in its path . of course if moved slower than bob barker  s impacted bowels  but it had menacing pencil  thin armatures and the ability to cast a ominous green glow that could stop bullets and equipped with a laser capable of cutting through mere balsa wood in an hour or two  with some assistance  .  br    br   moving on . . . as the weirdness and bell bottoms continue . . . we found out that they  re caught in a  space time warp  . how do we garner this little nugget of scientific information  because the oldest male lead tells his son that  in a more or less off  the  cuff fashion  like reminiscing about  how you won the big game  over a cup of joe or an ice  cold bottle of refreshing coca  cola . was pops a scientist  nope  but he knew about horses and has apparently meddled as an amateur in string theory and einstein  s theories .  br    br   the recording i watched on dvd was almost bootleg quality . the sound was muddy and the transfer looked like it had been shot off a theater screen with the video recorder on a cell phone  other than that  it was really  really  really bad .  there  s not enough  really  s  to describe it  really  .  br    br   i know some out there love this movie and compare it to other cult classics . i never saw this film on its original release  but even back then i think i would  ve come to the same conclusion bury this one quick .  ,0
this film has  over the past ten years  become one of my favorite pseudo noir experiences . the three storyline threads given us by kazan each have their unique and separate pleasures . the domestic chitchat between bel geddes and widmark  the movement between rooms  the small gestures such as the phone book barbara places on the chair under her son so he can reach the table  those small intimate exchanges between husband and wife  all are well crafted and natural . more than anything else  i love their porch  that second living room where it is clear they spend much of their summer time . the second thread is the professional relationship between many in the film but especially between widmark and douglas  characters . it may not be totally original and does get a bit blustery but all in all  it comes across as real  respectful and efficient . the third thread  the grungy tale of blackie and his tattered little gang  gets us closest to a dark and frightening noir world . palance  s blackie is as cold as a block of ice . this self  proclaimed business man  this self made man clearly has a complexity we only briefly tap in to . for me  this film continues to be a completely satisfying experience .  ,1
this is one of those awful  sex  driven b  movies that couldn  t have played anywhere near a theater . women run around dressed in scantily clad  bunny  outfits  an extremely fat woman is the brunt of many tasteless jokes  and they all work at the restaurant of a dirty old man  who has an oddball son  jim hanks  who is of course tom  s brother   whom the man wants to get  laid .  hanks is actually sort of good  but this movie goes nowhere and has no point . one must wonder why it was even made  nevertheless  because of hank  s performance and a few entertaining moments  but no more than a few   it received a stellar    out of   . i think i was being nice  though .  ,0
i saw this movie in      my first year of living in new york . i went on to live there for the next   years  but never saw anything as delicate and beautiful again as this small tv movie . it was part of a pbs series as i recall  and i  ve never forgotten it .  br    br   there are no sex scenes to speak of  just delicate  moving  extraordinarily touching moments full of tension and excitement  all set within a conservative  boston  i think   world war  environment where women played the role of devoted wife awaiting the return of husband from the war  and did not seek out a career and financial independence . frances lee mccain is superb in the role of career photographer and i have spent the next   odd years searching for her in equally challenging roles to no avail .  br    br   there has to be a video of this movie  sure it should be on dvd but surely at least a video   ,1
i understand there was some conflict between leigh and the great maggie smith during the filming . understandable when you put one of the world  s greatest actresses of all time  smith  of course  with one whose performances seem to get worse with each subsequent film .  ,0
  minutes into this movie i was hyperventilating  shaking  and writhing in pain . and not in the good way . the story is about a troupe of idiotic children making prank phone calls to a psycho which is always a good idea . turns out psychos don  t like prank phone calls because in  minutes time he  s at their door killing poor williams mom and dad . well skip ahead   years and guess what  still prank phone calling people . yep you would of thought that a horrible murder would of deterred them from doing that ever again but no . so after about two hours later and way too many scream ripoffs i realized that this movie gave me nothing but a terrible taste in my mouth and a severe urge to take my own life . this piece of crap isn  t even worth laughing at the shoddy production  the  acting   or rutger haurs dwindling career . i love crappy horror movies but this is the most unsatisfying piece i  ve ever seen . just don  t .  ,0
in this movie  joe pesci slams dunks a basketball . joe pesci . . .  br    br   and being consistent  the rest of the script is equally not believable .  br    br   pesci is a funny guy  which saves this film from sinking int the absolute back of the cellar  but the other roles were pretty bad . the father was a greedy businessman who valued money more than people  which wasn  t even well  played . instead of the man being an archetypal villain  he seemed more like an amoral android programmed to make money at all costs . then there  s the token piece that is assigned to pesci as a girlfriend or something . . . i don  t even remember . . . she was that forgettable .  br    br   anyone who rates this movie above a  or  is a paid member of some sort of film studio trying to up the reputation of this sunken film  or at least one of those millions of media minions who can  t critique efficiently  you know  the people who feel bad if they give anything a mark below   .  br    br   stay away . . . far away . and shame on comedy central  where i saw this film . they usually pick better .  ,0
saw a trailer for this on another video  and decided to rent when it came out . boy  was i disappointed  the story is extremely boring  the acting  aside from christopher walken  is bad  and i couldn  t care less about the characters  aside from really wanting to see nora  s husband get thrashed . christopher walken  s role is such a throw  away  what a tease   ,0
i own almost every seagal movie  yes even ones like this that are low budget   and i must say  this may be the worst  not only of his movies  but of all movies ever made . the only highlight of this film  and only reason i gave it  stars instead of   is that a . it is seagal  and b . seagal does have some sweet action sequences  specifically in the store  and also when ever else he takes out an entire army with a knife . next time give me   minutes of seagal killing people  and don  t even bother with a story line  because the storyline not only stunk  but so did the acting  the fact that f     s and f     s somehow changed into f    s  and also the fact that the stealth was as fast as an f    . also the stealth never had to refuel    and since when is afghanistan considered hostile territory from an air force stand point . last i checked  afghanistan has no air force  we  usa  control the skies . also  this top secret mission was played through speakers to all the crew in the room  yet the admiral still whispers to the other guy that it is secret . also  how did seagal go from the bottom of the truck  to the top  please tell us why they jailed him  since when are air force pilots great commandos  unless they are owen wilson   and since when are their drunks in arab countries  considering muslims don  t drink alcohol  also on top of that  since when do arabs listen to orders from females like the   in charge  the highlight of the film was definitely seagal killing people in the store  and the other   people he killed with a knife  as well as the very brief and totally random lesbian scene that came out of nowhere .  ,0
this movie was horrible  simply put . it was so bad i registered with imdb to warn you of its dangers .  br    br   i am a campy horror film expert  per se . i have watched  redneck zombies    house of the psychotic women    slumber party massacre ii  and many others . i know my schlock . and i know this movie sucks .  br    br   three fourths of the film is comprised of scared individuals running from one side of the screen to the other . when they are not running  they are spouting non  sequitur lines  devoid of emotion or motivation . when the actors begin to be acceptable  the direction falls to pieces . there were so many jarring low  angle shots i figured leif jonker had a  foot tall tripod . he used what i call the  leif maneuver  several millions times that is  zooming out from an object of interest like an amateur . apparently the film crew couldn  t get up early enough to film a sunrise  so they filmed a sunset . . . and played it in reverse . with direction this lazy  you are actually impressed with the final gory scene . the only thing you can figure is that the last five minutes was filmed before the first eighty  five minutes .  br    br   if you want a good  bad  gory movie  rent  riki  oh  or the foundational  dead alive .  if you are a schlock buff  and are looking for a challenge  give  darkness  a go .  br    br   quote o  the movie   br    br   vampire it  s die time   ,0
while i certainly consider the exorcist to be a horror classic  i have to admit that i don  t hold it in quite as high regard as many other horror fans do . as a consequence of that  i haven  t seen many of the exorcist rip  offs  and if exorcismo is anything to go by  i  ll have to say that  s a good thing as this film is boring as hell and certainly not worth spending ninety minutes on it  in fairness to the other exorcist rip  offs  this is often considered one of the worst  and so maybe it wasn  t the best place for me to start . it  s not hard to guess what the plot will be basically it  s the same as the one in the exorcist and sees a girl get possessed by a demonic spirit  which happens to be the spirit of her dead father  . the village priest is then called in to perform the exorcism . like many spanish horror films  this one stars paul naschy  who is pretty much the best thing about the film . exorcismo was directed by juan bosch  who previously directed the derivative spanish giallo  the killer wore gloves  . i haven  t seen any of his other films  but on the basis of these two i believe that originality wasn  t one of his strong points . there  s not a lot of good things i can say about the film itself it mostly just plods along and the exorcism scene isn  t worth waiting for . i certainly don  t recommend it   ,0
i have been watching horror movies since i was  years old  beginning with childs play . since then  i have seen good horror movies and bad  but this is without question  the dumbest movie i have ever seen  the actors did all they could with the material . the plot was just idiotic . plus  it was just all gore . i can stomach a lot of blood  but that was just ridiculous  in one of the scenes  a character gets stabbed in the rear end and choked with his intestines  plain stupid  another problem with this movie is that its boring and probably the slowest movie ever made . the end of it is just dumb . but then again  it goes with the rest of it  at the end  when the girl gets away from the cannibal  ancestor  she receives help from a old lady . the old lady is making tea  but when she turns around to talk to the girl  the girl attacks her  she turned into a cannibal  retarded movie .  ,0
there are some great philosophical questions . what is the purpose of life  what happens when we die  and why do they make movies this bad    the premise is absurd . thre acting is one dimensional . the special effects are overdone . and the movie is one unending gun battle among some of the lousiest shots hollywood ever produced . but then  if they had been good shots  everybody would have been dead in the first five minutes and there would be no movie . too bad it didn  t happen that way . tempted to turn it off several times  i stuck with it to see just how bad it could get . glad i did because  spoiler   the last line is the crowning stupidity of the whole dopey  dismal scenario . it is not even worthy of second feature status at a third rate drive  in in off season . apart from the general awfulness of the film  i worry deeply about its impact on young audiences . the americans crank out crap like this and then wonder why events like columbine happen . this is truly banal cinema on a brobdingnagian scale   ,0
the husband  and  wife team of bennie fields and blossom seeley were huge stars in vaudeville  yet they made very few films . as is the case for some other performers of their era  george m . cohan  fanny brice  gertrude lawrence  the most accessible piece of film footage for fields and seeley is the biopic about them  in which they  re portrayed by other actors  somebody loves me   starring betty hutton and that inimitable song  and  dance man ralph meeker .  br    br   in their heyday  fields and seeley were so hugely popular that another husband  and  wife vaudeville act   jesse block and eve sully   achieved nearly as much stardom performing an almost identical act  effectively becoming the  second  team  fields and seeley . offstage  though  there was a major difference in the couples  living arrangements . fields and seeley lived in hotel suites  paying room  service rates for every meal they ate  and eventually running out of money . block and sully lived modestly and invested their earnings wisely  ending in comfortable retirement .  br    br   the first   seconds of this vitaphone short are occupied by two spats  wearing pianists . apparently these two men had some slight name value of their own in      although i  ve never heard of them . finally  fields and seely rush in and start performing . they both have plenty of pep  and she  s fairly attractive .  br    br   i was annoyed that both performers keep making movements as if they  re about to break into a dance  but they never quite do so until the third of the three songs they perform in this short . when they finally start hoofing  the results are not impressive .  br    br   i was delighted to have this opportunity to see these two major performers doing their vaude act . now that i  ve seen it  i understand why they never became stars in movie musicals . my rating for this one just  out of    and i  ll stick with block and sully .  ,0

lapyuta  castle in the sky   more than any of hayao miyazaki  s movies  brings the joy of storytelling to the audience . it is the kind of movie that makes one feel like a kid again it  s just magical . it  s a crime that it took this long for it to be released in the states  but now that it  s here check it out  and stick with the original language the dub changed my impressions of the characters somewhat  which is something that should be avoided at all costs in a translation of a movie  or book  whatever .   br    br   i give it a ten  ten .  ,1

wonderful actors .  br    br   lousy script and not too great direction either . my main problem was i simply didn  t care about any of these people . not the killer not the victims . the settings were pretty drab . dennis quaid  s character was so poorly written in  i didn  t even care when the end came . he got his kid back . big deal  i wanted my money back .  ,0
if  unlike some of the commenters here  you are not staging a class war and don  t mind seeing the lives of other people who are fairly successful  extroverted  bohemian  gasp  and not being terribly english at a party and getting into all sorts of trouble as a result this is not a bad film  closer to euro cinema rather than an imitation of the usual slick american crap . . . i believe the minimal sound design and cheap camera is a conscious decision rather than bad film making  i  d defend this  the film isn  t any worse as a result  and it puts the spotlight on the cast  some of whom are really good  kate hardie  think that  s her name  as the sarcastic drunk is spot  on  the one exception being david baddiel  who should never be allowed to appear in serious stuff   it  s light  and we don  t go for this kind of anatomising  of  relationship crap in this country  but if you don  t have any real friends to go to a party with than you could do worse than to sit in and watch this .  ,1
still a sucker for pyun  s esthetic sense  i liked this movie  though the  unfinished  ending was a let  down . as usual  pyun develops a warped sense of humour and kathy long  s fights are extremely impressive . beautifully photographed  this has the feel it was done for the big screen .  ,0
what was steven seagal thinking  i mean firstly i love seagal . i love all his movies up to the mid     s . his early stuff is some of the best in the genre . this however does not live up to its excellent name . attack force  with protagonist marshall lawson seagal  would be expected to be a mindless action movie with seagal in typical one  liner ass kicking form . however  what we get is a crime mystery  bordering on a political thriller with little or no action . seagal is always in shadows because of his weight . i could not follow this story . there  s people who mutate to superhumans when they take a drug . what happened in this movie . the dubbing of seagal is a disgrace  a shambles and a shame . why dub the man  the story is terrible . this got a     from me because of the scene where seagal asks for backup despite having an army with him  and an hilarious fight scene where seagal swings his hands like a girl facing the camera   revenge is a two way street  seagal says in this movie . . . well forget revenge steven  you need redemption   ,0
this great film is composed mostly of documentary footage is currently contained on a dvd along with prelude to war . the great american filmmaker and story teller frank capra made these films which simply and clearly call attention to the main points that caused world war ii and hitler  s rise .  br    br   every school child  nay  every american should watch these films today because they are so apropos . history has been repeating itself over and over again  the lord chamberlains are still alive and kicking the tactics used by the nazis of infiltrating countries through sympathizers and then the communists and now by muslim terrorist groups  are still working to these evil group  s advantage .  br    br   by sitting back and letting hitler as early as     be aggressive  france  america and england caused over   million people  s deaths . americans  french and british today would happily let hitler do exactly the same thing despite the fact that we should have learned from history what happens when you let dictators break treaties .  br    br   these great films may be too simplistic for world war ii history buffs . they don  t tell the horrors that the soviet union caused simply because at the time america was teamed up with them  fighting hitler . this film does tell the plain facts and motives that led to the terrible war .  ,1
if you have any sort of appreciation for character and dialogue  and any sense of american cultural history  you will find a lot of very absorbing material in this film . it probably was originally a play  and that  s why it  s dialogue heavy  but i can  t stress enough how these icons that we only have a shallow understand of are made into truly complex and wonderful characters .  br    br   this film is better than any college course for telling you how to create a character  driven story .  br    br    ,1
compelling and innovative  at the beginning of this criminally underrated whoopi goldberg flick the writers draw a parallel between theodore rex and the     orson welles classic  citizen kane  . the writers are justified in drawing such a seemingly disparate parallel  but the viewing public is too often hoodwinked into seeing overly hyped hollywood schlock to appreciate the subtle similarities between these two movies . in  citizen kane  charles foster kane is feared and admired by his colleagues and his underlings  much like whoopi goldberg in this movie . this movie is about finding love in everybody  s differences . it is an epic examination of the fear of abandonment and the need for love and acceptance in a society that is dominated by greed and self  absorption . whoever paired whoopi goldberg and theodore rex formulated a dyad for the ages  with the only justifiable comparisons being bogey and bacall  hepburn and tracy and hall and oates . if you would love to watch an uplifting  celluloid philosophical examination of some of humanity  s deepest drives bergman  esqe but not as depressing  theodore rex should be viewed immediately   ,1
the only thing remarkable about this movie  is that all the actors could bomb at the same time . idiocy . i want my money back . . . and i got it free from the library . sheesh . i would rather chew on tin fool and shave my head with a cheese grater then watch this again .  ,0
  br    br   i am a big  time horror  sci  fi fan regardless of budget  but after watching countless horror movies late night on cable and video  this has to be the worst of all movies . with bloody special effects  what looked like a roast covered in fake blood or ketchup that kept being shown over and over again  and people running around screaming from left  then to right  then back again . it should have stayed with the beginning convenience store scene and stopped there and been   minutes . instead  it is dragged out very long . it is very  very x  low budget . many scenes were way  way too long . narrator sounded very amateurish like a random person out of junior high was talking . this is the only movie to rate lower in my opinion than manos  red zone cuba  benji  and godzilla vs . megalon despite their higher budgets .   snoozes  try to stay awake through whole movie in one setting or better yet  avoid it like you would an undead brain  eating mob . the why  did  i  ever  see  this  piece  of  zombie  dung  blues . epitome of nauseatingly bad made movies etc . . ad infinitum .  infinity     ,0
i love special effects and witnessing new technologies that make science fiction seem real . the special effects of this movie are very good . i have seen most of this movie  since it  s been airing on hbo for the past couple of months . i must admit  i may have missed a few scenes  but i  m usually drawn into movies  and have seen some scenes more than once . but every time i see some of  hollow man   i feel depressed  almost like a  film noir .  i  m not sure why perhaps it  s that i don  t want kevin bacon to be evil  and there  s disappointment in that . but i think it  s witnessing just how relentlessly evil he becomes . regardless  i can recommend this movie for excitement  although some parts move slowly   but i do not recommend for youngsters under the age of    perhaps    if they are mature  .  ,0
this movie was in a sci  fi    pack a friend of mine got me for christmas . it is very similar to the first gozilla movie  and like that movie  has scenes with american actors inserted for no real reason . one interesting thing about the inserted scenes is that there  s a cold war tension portrayed between america and russia . like in godzilla  gamera is awakened by an atomic explosion and rampages across the world  paying close attention to tokyo because no big monster movie is complete unless tokyo bites it . all in all  this is an okay movie . some of the scenes involving gamera  particularly the scenes in toly  are quite spectacular and have special effects that were pretty decent at the time . if you like japanese giant monster movies  you  ll really get a kick out of this one . i give it a  out of   . had this been the unedited japanese version that i watched  it probably would  ve gotten a  .  ,0
this is one of the greatest films i have ever seen i glowed inside throughout the whole film . the music and cinematography held the spell when little was happening on screen . the slow pace was set by the mode of travel  a riding lawn mower with a big trailer  and was maintained by the background sights and sounds and the slow  paced lives of the other characters .  br    br   the story actually happened alvin straight died in     at the age of   . there was no acting everything was completely real  as if the actors had actually transformed into the characters . sissy spacek gave a poignant performance as a somewhat disabled daughter who had suffered much but forged ahead  always wanting to do the right thing . richard farnsworth was cast perfectly and he beautifully became alvin straight  a stubborn but loving elderly man who treks across iowa to visit his estranged brother  lyle  who has had a stroke . alvin had learned much wisdom during his life and that seemed to bring out the best in the people that he encountered along the way .  br    br   the film underscores the importance of family to this man and  hopefully  to all of us . i eagerly anticipate seeing it again  and again . directed by david lynch  this films proves his directorial skill . farnsworth was nominated for an academy award for best actor at    he was the oldest nominee ever for that award .  ,1
it is a great tragedy that both richard harris and john derek are no longer with us . but that shouldn  t blind anybody to the fact that in      a pretty ugly blotch appears on both men  s cvs . no doubt john derek conceived this movie doing for his wife what  some like it hot  and  one million years bc  did for maryln monroe and raquel welsh respectively  creating an iconic sex symbol for the new decade . having run to embrace dudley moore on the beach in     bo  s reputation  an all  star cast and location filming in sri lanka meant that nothing could go wrong . alas  as they say  mortals plan and god laughs . it is said that when this film premiered in      the edgar rice burrows estate tried to take legal action against it . bo derek plays jane parker who sets off into turn  of  the century africa to be reunited with her boozy  abusive dad  richard harris . daddy parker is an explorer who has set out to find  the great inland sea  the stuff of local legend  whose existence has been poo  pooed by conventional wisdom . harris is worth watching for a wonderfully hammy  tanked  up performance which includes singing an irish ditty at an indian elephant that somehow found its way into africa  did it arrive at the same time as the orang  utan from sumatra     furthermore  although jane professes to despise parker  bo and rich  s relationship is creepily incestuous  testimony perhaps to the effects of the tropical heat . before long  however  local legends start to circulate about a  great white ape  and jane hears the famous yodel . this is the movie  s cue for miles o  keefe  a future b  movie star  making a rather odd debut as the loin  clothed lord of the jungle . unlike johnny weismuller with his pidgin english or ron ely who speaks the language fluently  the o  keefe tarzan is mute . given some of bo and richie  s dialog  though  this is probably not a bad thing . harris and his caravan eventually reaches the great inland sea  located atop a gigantic plateau that seems to run halfway across africa . . . . hang on  aren  t seas  lakes and other watery places generally located in low  lying areas   nevermind  it is just one of many anomalies in the john derek universe . the crew attempt to mount the cliffs and when the ropes snap  harris roars echoing abuse at the hapless men who have plummeted to their deaths . on another occasion  jane decides to take a nude swim by the inland sea  giving another occasion to see some gratuitous nudity . out of nowhere a single male lion appears . now lions usually travel in prides and never go near beaches but later on  tarzan will be wrestling with a  venomous  boa constrictor . zoology doesn  t seem to have been one of john derek  s strong points . . . . . this being a tarzan movie  jane becomes enchanted with the lord of the jungle and resolves to take his virginity . but having seen his closeness to some of those chimps  you do have to wonder . . . speaking of which  it  s not only the edgar rice burroughs estate could have sued . it is highly probable that certain primates were on the phone to their lawyers the chimps here make you miss cheeta badly . especially when they do ridiculous things like ride on the backs of elephants and clap their hands when tarzan and jane finally get it on  the climax of this film has bo and harris captured by some rather stereotypical cannibals who paint our heroine and prepare to sacrifice  eat  execute her . suffice is to say that the great wooden ape gets his girl and spoiler harris gets himself impaled on a huge elephant tusk  this doesn  t stop the dying parker from delivering a rambling monologue to jane . as far as i am aware  the law suit from the rice burrows estate never materialized but  tarzan the ape man  was crucified at the box office  no kidding   a pity . john derek could have directed  tarzan the ape man   with bo derek and miles o  keefe living in domestic bliss and dudley moore as  boy .   ,0
this is a film i decided to go and see because i  m a huge fan of adult animation . i quite often find that when a film doesn  t evolve around a famous actor or actress but rather a story or style  it allows the film to be viewed as a piece of art rather than a showcase of the actors ability to differ his styles .  br    br   this film is certainly more about style than story . while i found the story interesting  a thriller that borrows story and atmosphere from films such as blade runner and many anime films   it was a bit hard to follow at times  and didn  t feel like it all came together as well as it could have . it definitely had a mixed sense of french animation and japanese anime coming together . whether thats a good thing or not is up to the viewer . visually this film is a treat for the eyes  and in that sense a work of art .  br    br   if you like adult animation  or would like to see a film that is different from most films out at the moment . i would recommend it . all i can say is that i enjoyed the experience of the film but did come away slightly disappointed because it could have been better  ,1

  shore leave  is mostly an average star trek adventure . nothing wrong with the episode  though . i simply think that this is not the best representation of what the show had to offer to fans . it is lightweight entertaining  nothing more . however  i  m glad to see that a tv show of this type had enough good sense to take a break from serious intergalactic conflicts . in this episode  kirk decides to grant his crew some time off  and a landing party is beamed down to a planet that looks like the perfect place for a vacation . as usual  the planet is not as peaceful as it appears to be . there are some action and tense moments  but most of the story is played for laughs . good  but unexceptional .  ,1
oh yes  sakura killers is a goofy  horrible ninja movie  make no mistake . but it  s also an incredibly enjoyable one . this is largely thanks to the awesome presence of one chuck connors  who is billed as starring in the movie but really only shines in a few scenes . i suppose he  s supposed to be sort of an obi wan kenobi type   the tough ninja  buster   the box copy exclaims  but his  wisdom  is laughable .  move without thinking     my friend says this is the sign of mental retardation  not of supreme concentration .  br    br   but really  his two aides  sonny and dennis  have such horrible dialogue that  brooklyn   as we call the colonel  tends to shine in comparison . especially watch for dennis  logic regarding the  genetic splicing  the sakura are involved with . if you know anything about cloning you will die laughing . and yes  this is a major plot point  folks .  br    br   a terribly fun movie  sakura killers is a hard  to  find gem . i won  t spoil the  trick  ending for you either  except that it  s a perfect set up for a sakura killers  . too bad chuck connors died .    because he does have a the smoothest ways of blowing away ninjas .  ,0
in spite of having some exciting  and daring  sequences  nbtn just never gets going . there are exploding boats  hat pin murders  mass suicides  pathologists with body parts  and all sorts of classic mystery  horror scenes  but they  re interspersed with extended periods of pure exposition . everybody in the movie looks bored . this is a shame because many of the sequences would be considered daring at the time this was filmed .  br    br   add to this the  too  proper  brit characters and you feel like you  ve drifted into a sherlock holmes movie .  br    br   finally  the cinematography is very ordinary . there are lots of opportunities for beautiful shots of of the countryside  or complex shots of someone being pulled into a huge bonfire  but the whole thing is unimaginative and dull .  br    br   definitely only for lee and cushing fans .  ,0
i have been familiar with the fantastic book of  goodnight mister tom  for absolutely ages and it was only recently when i got the chance to watch this adaption of it . i have heard lots of positive remarks about this  so i had high hopes . once this film had finished  i was horrified .  br    br   this film is not a good film at all .  goodnight mister tom  was an extremely poor adaption and practically  .     of the book was missed out . particularly  i found that a lot of the characters and some great scenes in the book were not in this . there was not much dialogue  it was rushed and far too fast  moving  but i was mostly upset by the fact that you never got to see the bonding and love between william beech and tom in this film which was a true let down . the casting was not all that good  either . i thought this could have been really good  but it was so different to the book  anextremely poor adaption  one of the worst i  ve seen . this deserves a decent remake that  d better be     times better than this pile of garbage .  ,0
having only seen two of his pictures previously  i  ve come to terms with altman . before  though  i always labeled his style of film  making  boring .  you just have to be in the right mind to appreciate his crazy genius .  br    br    health  is fairly underrated  and very questionably out of print . in fact  i don  t think it  s ever even been issued to vhs . why is that  when all of these crappy films get dvd releases daily  this one is left behind for no good reason  honestly  i had no real problems with this film . it was  for the most part  consistently amusing and funny . almost all of the scenes are mysteriously interesting for some reason  be it the wonderful dialogue or the subtle performances . there is real skill here .  br    br   and paul dooley  s stint on the bottom of the pool halfway through is fascinating .  br    br   if you can  try to find a copy of this forgotten little gem . it  s not perfect  but it  s much better than most of the sludge out there getting dvd releases . hell  i  d be happy with a nice vhs copy of this thing .  br    br   it  s often on the fox movie channel  though  so look out for it .  ,1
this interesting giallo boosts a typical but still thrilling plot and a really sadistic killer that obviously likes to hunt his victims down before murdering them in gory ways .  br    br   directed by emilio p . miraglia who  one year earlier  also made the very interesting  la notte che evelyn usci della tomba   see also my comment on that one   the film starts off a little slow  but all in all  no time is wasted with unnecessary sub plots or sequences .  br    br   this film is a german  italian coproduction  but it was released in germany on video only in a version trimmed by   minutes of plot under the stupid title  horror house  . at least the murder scenes  which will satisfy every gorehound  are fully intact  and the viewer still gets the killer  s motive at the end . but the italian version containing all the footage is still the one to look for  of course .  br    br   a convincing giallo with obligatory twists and red herrings   la dama rossa uccide sette volte  is highly recommended to giallo fans and slightly superior to miraglia  s above mentioned other thriller .  ,1
in her autobiography  laureen bacall reveals that bogie told her that she should not make such dud movies as this one or something like that . at the time  douglas sirk was labeled  weepies for women   actually  he was restored to favor  at least in europa  after he stopped directing . and when he filmed  written on the wind   sirk had only three movies to make  tarnished angels    a time to love and a time to die   his masterpiece  imho  and finally  imitation of life        . then there was silence . actually bacall and hudson characters do not interest sirk . they are too straight  too virtuous . dorothy malone  who was some kind of substitute for his former german star zarah leander  and her brother robert stack provide the main interest of the plot . a plot constructed continuously  most of the movie being a long flashback . the instability of the brother and the sister  from a family of rich texan oil owners  is brought to the fore by garish clothes  and rutilant cars that go at top speed in a derricks landscape . malone  s metamorphosis at the end of the movie is stunning suit and chignon  toying with a small derrickshe  s ready for life  the rebel is tamed . now alone  because she  s lost hudson  but anyway  he was not in love with her  . this end is a bit reactionary  but melodrama is par excellence reactionarythree years later  in  imitation of life   sarah  jane  susan kohner  will be blamed because she does not know her place .  ,1
despite an overall pleasing plot and expensive production one wonders how a director can make so many clumsy cultural mistakes . where were the japanese wardrobe and cultural consultants  not on the payroll apparently .  br    br   a japanese friend of mine actually laughed out loud at some of the cultural absurdities she watched unfold before her eyes . in a later conversation she said   imagine a finnish director making a movie in fnnish about the american civil war using blond swedish actors as union army and frenchmen as the confederates . worse imagine dressing the scarlet o  hara female lead in a period hoop skirt missing the hoop and sporting a      s hairdo . maybe some people in finland might not realize that the hoop skirt was  missing the hoop  or recognize the bizarre jane mansfield hair  but in atlanta they would not believe their eyes or ears . . . . and be laughing in the aisles . . . excellent story and photography be damned .  br    br   so . . . watching memoirs of a geisha was painful for anyone familiar with japanese cultural nuances  actual geisha or japanese dress  and that was the topic of the movie  hollywood is amazing in its myopic view of film making . they frequently get the big money things right while letting the details that really polish a films refinement embarrassingly wrong . i thought  the last samurai  was the crowning achievement of how bad an otherwise good film on japan could be . memoirs of a geisha is embarrassingly better and worse at the same time .  ,0
on the surface   show me the money  should have at least finished a full season . you had the always entertaining william shatner as your host  surrounded by a baker  s dozen of beautiful leggy models collectively called  the million dollar dancers .  you had knowledgeable contestants who had interesting stories to tell of their lives and who presumably knew a lot of pop culture trivia . and you had big money  so  what went wrong   br    br   the format of this game was the failure . a good game show needs at least two of three things very simple rules  exciting pacing and the ability for the viewer to play along at home . the best  most enduring ones have all three .  br    br   unfortunately  smtm had none .  br    br   the rules for this game were among the most complex of any prime time game show in history . let me try to explain how the game worked  as briefly as possible .  br    br   a contestant began with a single word or short phrase followed by the choice letters a  b  c  subtle plug for the network   . each letter was connected to a separate question  all starting with that word or phrase . once a contestant chose one of the letters  they could either answer that question or pass and select a second letter . if they passed  they got to view the next question  and had the same option . however  if they passed the second question  they were required to answer the third option .  br    br   after they answered and before they found out if their answer was correct  they then had to select one of the   dancers on stage  each with a different amount of money in a scroll by their side . they revealed their dollar amount  ranging from        to          and depending on if the contestant answered right . . . or answered wrong . . . that amount would be added to or subtracted from their pot .  br    br   still with me so far  in addition  there was one dancer who held something known as  the killer card .  if you selected the dancer with the killer card and you had gotten your question right  you were safe  and the game continued . if  however  you were incorrect  you had one final question to answer . if you got that final question wrong  you were out of the game . if you got it right  then  the game continued .  br    br   there was no quitting  no walking away with the money earned until you either answered six questions correctly or got six questions wrong or you were so far in the hole you couldn  t earn enough money to get back out . got it  okay   br    br   the biggest problem  as i saw it  was a complete lack of tension  because of the design of the game . a contestant could pass questions they knew they didn  t know  and answer many questions they did know  making the pressure even less . then  they could still find a low dollar amount  even after knowingly missing a question  which meant there still wasn  t any  drama .  and the fact that they could answer five questions wrong and still have a chance to win was a big mistake . and the pacing of the questions was deadly slow often the questions were so obvious  it was ridiculous to try to create tension  as if there was any doubt about some of the most common answers .  br    br   the pacing  the lack of any real tension at any point during the show and those very complicated rules prevented this program from working  despite shatner  s terpsichorean talents .  ,0
for anyone with a moderate sensibility  a moderate feeling of the human and humane condition  for anyone capable of getting above the hollywood ilk  for anyone who is satisfied seeing cinema which does not have a series of seagals  willis  van dammes blasting the brains out of anybody or seeing who gets into bed with whom  for anyone whose intellectual level reaches a capacity to grasp  sympathise with  comprehend  laugh with  cry with natural tender heart  warming hilarious compassionate human beings  le huitime jour  is waiting for you . jaco van dormael has not achieved simply a masterpiece  that would have been too simplistic he has achieved one of those rare monumental works of art in the cinematographic world which defies any kind of encapsuling . is it a drama  is it a comedy  no it is the story of georges  a wonderful funny pitiful laughable loving frightened beautiful personality  a sufferer of the downes syndrome . it is a story which has you laughing through your tears  but this is not one of those classic tear  jerkers this film moves through a world that has you at once mixing your feelings of compassion or pity or even shame with those of admiration  warmth and even love . a successful banking salesman  harry  bumps into georges they were both going in opposite directions with absolutely opposing ideas  problems and priorities skillfully van dormael melts these two unlikely men into a warm friendship  but which is so much more than the good buddy friendship of those having a beer down the road . this is a relationship which develops into a profound needing by both for the other . the cuasi  surrealist scenes fit in perfectly georges recalls  or invents  past scenes of his life while either day  dreaming or sleeping even the almost phantasmagorical final scene is totally correct . the only scene which might be considered a little out of place is when they steal a bus and drive it out of the show  rooms . however  this does not detract from the whole . this film is a monument . even if your french is not up to much  please bear seeing it with sub  titles . le huitime jour  is worth the trouble . as for anything else  well  just read the following commentaries  i go along with all of them . this film is a joy  it is majestic  it is unique . if you have seen rain man  which i consider an excellent film  you must see this one it is far superior because it has not the superficial veneer of famous hollywood  produced world  renowned actors it has pascal duquenne and daniel auteuil  ten oscars for these two  and three more for jaco van dormael . who cares  yes   out of   if the imdb rating doesn  t break down under the strain .  br    br   magnifique  chapeau   ,1

  la bte  by walerian borowczyk is based on the short story  lokis  written by prosper merime . lucy broadhurst  lisabeth hummel   an american heiress betrothed to the son of an impoverished marquis  arrives at the family  s crumbling chteau and learns of a mythical ursine beast purported to prowl the nearby forest . it is fabled that a former lady of the house  sirpa lane  once engaged in perverse sex with the creature and lucy finds herself consumed by dreams of the incident .  the beast  is an art  house mix of surreal horror  explicit sleaze and porno . there  s implied bestiality  assault and perversion in the priesthood  copious fake ejaculate smeared on bared breasts  masturbation with a rose and  most graphic of all  the eponymous beast toying with incredibly big phallus . still this genuinely erotic film is wonderfully photographed and tasteless . the women here are stunningly beautiful and they are naked most of the time . overall  la bte  is a visual feast . whether it be from the fetishistic attention to detail  or the visual motifs pregnant with information  borowczyk  s masterpiece should be watched with care and attention . a must  see for fans of european cult cinema .  ,1
in spite of its impressive cast and crew pedigree gingerbread man crumbles early and often . the plot is unrealistically convoluted  the actors sport bad accents and director robert altman  s participation amounts to collecting a pay check . once again he has assembled an impressive cast  like woody allen  everyone wants to work with altman  that this time around to the letter is miscast . but that  s only part of the problem .  br    br   kenneth branagh is rick magruder a high powered georgia lawyer who in the film  s heavy handed opening scenes manages to get himself preposterously seduced by a mysterious catering company waitress who convinces him she is in grave danger from an ex  husband and a loony dad . with red flags everywhere the astute lawyer plods on even managing to get his children in harms way . fights of gun and fist follow along with a requisite car chase and if that  s not enough there  s a hurricane thrown in for the ridiculous finale .  br    br   branagh plays macgruder with a mealy and unconvincing southern accent . running around in a trench coat in all kinds of weather he  s blind to the obvious in order to keep the story going . hipster bob downey jr . is every bit as bad as a p . i . but with a little more emphasis on the bad accent . robert duvall as the old man is boo radely all growed up en crazier than a bed bug serving some thick slices of ham but at least his twang is plausible . the female leads  embeth davidtz  darryl hannah  famkhee jansen  are lean leggy and unemotive . even the celebrity lawyers doing cameos  vernon jordan  are wooden with the few throw away lines they have .  br    br   in addition to paying little attention to his actors  altman  s mise en scene dripping with spanish moss is murky and shapeless  his action scenes comic book . it lacks his offbeat touches and observations  he does inform the viewer that the stars and bars still wave in georgia  that make a well done altman so unique . unfortunately  gingerbread man is altman at his worst  even if the pay is the same .  ,0
i saw this when on the wonderful world of disney as a kid  so i didn  t recall much of it . as i watched it recently  i sat there thinking   this is the weirdest thing i  ve seen  .  br    br   the  traveling  scenes look like something caused by an lsd overdose . the animated characters are mostly oddly colored  voiced versions of jungle book and robin hood characters . some not  so  disney things i noticed kids being threatened at knife point and prostitutes  during the portobello road song  .  br    br   it was very entertaining  though the musical numbers were long and i can see little kids getting bored with them . also  the subject manner was a bit dark  seeing as it was set during ww  .  ,1
susan seidelman seems to have had a decent career with a few top notch credits under her belt . i  m certainly glad she bounced back from this film which seems to have its admirers . i  m not one of them .  br    br   i  ve seen better acting in high school plays than i did in smithereens . the plot such as it is involved young susan berman who is ambitious to make it in the world of music and is willing to do just about anything to get there . she even rejects the sincere advances of a young artist who is living out of his van off the east river played by brad rijn .  br    br   young mr . rijn contributes the worst performance in the film  in fact one of the worst acting jobs i  ve seen in a long time . no wonder he  s not gone anywhere .  br    br   i will say that seidelman  s eye for the camera is a good one in capturing the familiar east village locations where the film was mostly shot . but her work with her live performers didn  t measure up . i  m not sure she had that much raw material to work with .  br    br   look fast and you  ll see a very young christopher noth before law and order and sex in the city as a street hustler .  br    br   if you like punk rock  you might sit through this for the soundtrack . i  ll stick to bing crosby .  ,0
  this may be a bit on the spoilerish side  i would like to start by saying i did not watch the entire movie  nor could i because it was evident from the first hour that i was going to be incredibly disappointed . that of course is the problem with taking  what many believe to be an amazing book  and turning it into a disney made  for  tv movie .  br    br   a wrinkle in time should have been made into an amazing movie a long time ago . it  s got a great storyline that could hook children and adults . plus it  s got built in quality sequels . but disney  fying was not the way to go . the problem with the movie is that all the things they changed to turn it into a visual story dumbed down what was so great about the book . it is a complicated and emotional story for kids . there was no reason to make charles wallace purely  psychic   because that was the easiest way of explaining it . there was no reason to write a fight between the three mrs . w  s as added tension  there is enough tension in the story without that . there was no reason to remove meg  s glasses . . . that deprived us of what could  ve been a very sweet scene between calvin and meg that happens in the book .  br    br   i could nitpick for days about little things  but i also think larger things  like the art direction was a off . take for instance the way they made camazotz look  with its strangely darkened skies . the creepiness that comes across in the book is that camazotz could be earth . it looks like earth . it has people on it that look like humans . the skies are blue  the grass is green  and there are children playing . but something is a little bit off . the directors chose to make camazotz a complete other instead of taking the lesson in the book and applying it to the overall direction of the movie . the lesson of course is that camazotz could very well be earth  that is if we forget how to love . it would  ve been much creepier to have a beautiful afternoon as they  re walking down the street with the kids bouncing the balls in the same rhythm .  br    br   i unfortunately did not watch the end . maybe someone can tell me how disney messed up the end as well .  br    br   overall an artistic disappointment .  br    br    ,0
of the ten actors who portrayed philo vance in the series  edmund lowe seemed the most personable  but in this script the audience is way ahead of the famed detective . after all  when the jockey  douglas walton  stares blankly in space  obviously hypnotized  and says something like  i must ride and be killed   i felt it was dumb that no one picked up on it after he does get killed . the police thought it was a suicide because he said he would do it  after hated horse owner gene lockhart gets shot and killed  frieda inescort does the same thing  saying she  s going out to be killed  and then fatally jumps off a bus . i laughed when lowe finally yells  i got it   as though it were a revelation . the guilty party  however  was cleverly concealed and there was considerable suspense generated when that party starts to hypnotize lowe to get him to jump off a roof .  ,0
my girlfriend has the habit of going to blockbuster and choosing movies no  one has ever heard anything about . admittedly  at times  it has led to some fun discoveries . often times  the best that can be said is they definitely run an hour and a half .  br    br   she brought home  advice from a caterpillar .  she was excited because the box said it was funny . lucky for us  the propaganda on the boxes never lie .  br    br   this movie was an exercise in patience . this is one of those movies where  unless you are a pretentious and shallow person who likes watching movies about yourself  you will hate every character in the movie . until the introduction of the one nice character . which the lead annoying pretentious character will fall in love with and act in such a way that  in the real world  would drive anyone away .  br    br   mild spoilers from here on  br    br   so a bunch of emotionally vapid  stuck  up  pretentious artists swear off love and find success in their careers . then  they meet a nice  intelligent  emotionally mature and loving character  an almost perfect guy  . we then watch the woman  the annoyingly pretentious artist  in her    s   freak out as she falls in love . so she tries to flee from the nice  intelligent  emotionally mature man and stay with the married man with whom she  s been having great but empty sex . she is rude to the man and does everything in her power to drive him away . in the real world  she would have been quite successful . i certainly wanted to flee from her and i wasn  t even in a relationship with her   br    br   although its nice that the man  fought for his love   i never wanted her to have him .  nor did my girlfriend  she didn  t deserve him . and  why i wonder  did the director think that the  almost perfect guy  should be punished by having to win a relationship with her  when the artist was asking the  almost perfect guy  to leave  we were screaming for him to leave too . there  s a problem with a movie when the heroine of the film is so annoying  childish and stupid that you want her to fail .  br    br   beyond that  let me say that andy dick made me laugh a few times even though his character was also pretentious to the point of annoyance . regarding the other characters  they were well acted  morally bankrupt and annoying characters .  br    br   it is a comedy and i can say i did laugh a few times in the film . unfortunately  not much laughing happened until the last   minutes or so . but by the time i had those laughs  i had been praying for the movie to end for far too long . i needed to get these vapid characters out of my life .  br    br   if you want to watch people you hate struggle with a love for people they don  t deserve  then this is the movie for you .  ,0

steve carell comes into his own in his first starring role in the   year old virgin  having only had supporting roles in such films as bewitched  bruce almighty  anchorman  and his work on the daily show  we had only gotten a small taste of the comedy that carell truly makes his own . you can tell that will ferrell influenced his  comedic air  but carell takes it to another level  everything he does is innocent  lovable  and hilarious . i would not hesitate to say that steve carell is one of the next great comedians of our time .  br    br   the   year old virgin is two hours of non  stop laughs  or  hours if you see it twice like i did   a perfect supporting cast and great leads charm the audience through the entire movie . the script was perfect with so many great lines that you will want to see the movie again just to try to remember them all . the music fit the tone of the movie great  and you can tell the director knew what he was doing .  br    br   filled with sex jokes  some nudity  and a lot of language  this movie isn  t for everyone but if you liked the wedding crashers  anchorman  or any movie along those lines  you will absolutely love the   year old virgin .  ,1
george lopez never caught my interest in his stand up comedy and he still doesn  t . but this show is a work of art . it  s not ever show where the jokes keep you laughing every time you remember it  and jokes that re memorable at that  . this show just has an upbeat look to it and the characters range from an old  short drunk to an dyslexic teenager . i don  t know who writes this show but that person does a great job . if they had just continued the show i  m sure that it would get a positive response from the critics of this great country . if you are looking for a good  traditional comedy  then george lopez is the show for you  the one bad thing is the title . george lopez  really  imagine the fresh prince of bel  air being  will smith  . c  mon man  but otherwise  this show is genius        ,1
i originally gave this episode a rating of two  i now wish i  d thought more about it . i also wish they had negative rating options .  br    br   watching it  i was amazed at how poor the whole thing was from start to finish . i adore ron pearlman  and john carpenter . . . so what went wrong   last season episode   was pulled due to the way it handled the abortion issue . i think that this season mr carpenter managed to make something so grey  area that you can  t immediately see if he is pro  choice or anti  abortion . it was only after i sat and thought about it that i realized he is very much anti  abortion  you get this most clearly in the end when the  mother  shoots the baby and kills it  to the dismay of the  father   who walks off in grief  leaving the mother unharmed . but you also see it in the way the ron p . character is treated  i hardly think that if someone has proved themselves enough of a threat in the past so as to have a restraining order against him that they would not immediately be ringing the police . instead we have the guard almost sympathetically dealing with him  only to pay for it in the end  i don  t mind someone having a strong view on something  even if it isn  t something i agree in  but i do think its a bit lame not to stand by that view  rather than trying to look like they  re sitting somewhere in the middle .  br    br   but  political issues aside  this episode was beyond poor . the music was retro     s and just plain didn  t work . the acting  other than ron p .  was poor . the effects were dreadful  it might have been better just to  not  show the monster at all rather than show the lame excuse for a monster they had .  br    br   all this being said  i  m glad they have the masters of horror  i don  t mind sitting through some really poor episodes to find the good ones . its a bit like renting horror movies from the video store  every now and again you get a good one and it makes it all worth while . i do agree with the poster that said maybe the name needs to change from masters  some of these people just plain don  t deserve the title .  let me stress tho  even tho i hated this episode  john carpenter totally deserves the title . he is a master thru and thru   ,0
up until the last few minutes of the movie  i would have given the movie a score of  or  stars . however  the ending is so terrible and  hollywoodized  that it completely undermines the first    of the movie .  br    br   the plot revolves around a submarine and the possibility that they received an order to fire their nuclear missiles . the captain  gene hackman  is all for launching  while his first officer  denzel washington  is in favor of confirming the launch orders first . the problem is  to launch both the captain and  st officer must simultaneously use their launch keys . hackman is determined to launch and washington stands firm until eventually this results in armed insurrection aboard the sub . eventually  the mistake is discovered and the missiles are not launched . cool . however  here comes the part that just doesn  t ring true . after they are back on land and go before a review board  washington and hackman  who  d just spent half the movie trying to kill each other  shake hands and are all buddy buddy  huh   too trite an ending to make the movie worth while for me .  ,0

everyone in a while  disney makes one of thoes movies that surprises everyone . one that keeps you wondering until the very end . in the tradition of pirates of the caribbean  this movie is sure to turn into a ghost  and kill and rape your village . it  s terrible . if you want a mindless  senseless  predictable  action  movie  go right ahead . i believe that young kids might enjoy this  as they like it when good always wins . but me  i like movies where it  s a toss up who  s going to win . this movie never lets the bad guys have the upper hand . by the end  when th heroes are left in an  inescapeable  pit  you just know that they can get out . everything works out perfect for cage and his friends  he never has to think over a riddle or clue for more than   seconds  no matter how complex it is . see this movie if you want to see some impressive set designs  not if you want to see good acting  or a good film . go watch a superman movie  it would be much shorter  and the kids would like it more . for instance  the scene where cage is fleeing from armed gunmen  and the bullets are all deflected by a the railing of a fire escape .  and i  m not talking about a fence or anything  just one little pole  this movie shows the decay of films and the film industry to cheap gags and dull  unrealistic action  which this movie provides in huge quantities .  ,0
the intruder  l  intrus   a film directed by french director clair denis  is the liberation of film . it follows its own spirit across time  space  and character . there may be a plot  but what i understood of that i picked up from the description on the netflix dvd sleeve . honestly  it  s probably better to know nothing about the film before watching it  because then the viewer can set aside any and all expectations . the film demands that the viewer think  but also taunts the fact that he or she will not gain full understanding .  br    br   the human heart is the film  s enigma . every image questions its role  its nature  and its form . the heart is the intruder  that of the viewer and that of louis . louis  character is played by michel subor with the peace and mystery required by such a character . honestly  anyone could  ve played louis  character  if he or she possessed a wandering  willing  and comfortable heart . yet subor is the one featured here he becomes the film  his identity is inseparable from it . many of the film  s images lingering in my mind revolve around his expressions  vocal but mainly physical .  br    br   the intruder is poetic in its ability to capture the stillness and fullness of movement  but more fluid than any literature in the shape it refuses to take .  surrealistic  has been a term used in describing this film  but perhaps  quasirealistic  is a more adequate term . nothing in the film exists outside of the possibilities of reality the simple omnipresent score confirms that by imagining in music the connection between heartbeat and dim light .  br    br   watch the trailer a few times if you  re attracted to visual imagery see the film to see the consequences of the combination of verse and a grasping for freedom .  ,1
joseph h . lewis was one of the finest directors of film noir . this is surely his best .  br    br   it doesn  t have some of the standard features of what we now call film noir . though american  made  it is set entirely in england . it lacks gangsters . it lacks a femme fatale . it does not lack crime .  br    br   the title character answers an ad . she is overjoyed that she  ll be making some money as a secretary . instead  she wakes up days later as the pawn in a frightening plot . only a very strong person could survive such a terrifyingly unsettling ordeal . and nina foch gives the sense of a strong woman as julia .  br    br   part of the excitement comes from casting against type ms . foch has an elegant manner . she is no screaming  cowering victim . she is actually a bit icy and patrician  albeit impecunious . this makes her character  s plight all the more believable .  br    br   surely the single most fascinating element is the casting of dame may witty . she was  and is  probably most famous for the charming title character in  the lady vanishes .  she has a sweet manner and a harmless  slightly dithering manner . but here she is far from a heroine .  br    br   george macready is excellent as her extremely troubled son . the whole cast  in fact  is superb .  br    br   it seems that this famous and brilliant movie was made almost by accident . undoubtedly the director knew exactly what he was doing . but he did it on a low budget . that is the thrill and charm of film noir  the real film noir it is small  convincingly lowlife  and  in this case  unforgettable .  ,1
i think it great example of the differences between two cultures . it would be a great movie to show in a sociology class . i thought it was pretty funny and i must say that i am a sucker for that  lets band together and get the job done  plot device . it seems most people don  t realize that this movie is not just a comedy . it has a few dramatic elements in it as well and i think they blend in nicely . overall  i give it a solid  .  ,1

i am so glad that i got a chance to see this rare little gem of a movie . i saw it at an independent film festival  so don  t expect it to come to your town anytime soon . during the film  i noticed about   people get up and walk out . too bad for them  down here in the south  folks don  t like having to read subtitles  . the movie starts out slow  but is so rich in dialogue that i never felt bored . when the action finally arrives  i found myself glued to the screen as if i were riding a roller coaster .  br    br   i also got a big kick of the chapter titles appearing before the chapters  especially the ones that introduce the characters as they appear on screen . it reminded me of zelda  ocarina of time  when you face level bosses .  br    br   if this is the future of  video game  comic book  movies  then i welcome it .  ,1
it got switched off before the opening credits had even finished appearing . the first joke was just so appallingly lame and dreadfully acted that it had to go . you shouldn  t really decide to watch this based on my review or not . i saw so little of it i shouldn  t even really be commenting but suddenly it all became clear why the video shop guy was sniggering at us paying money to see it .  br    br   couldn  t they have just made earnest does dallas   ,0
some of the acknowledged altman  masterpieces  seem sadder to me now . maybe it  s me . like the last reviewer  i even like this  lesser  altman  shown recently on fmc   although i don  t think he was aiming at a wide audience . organization politics as a  microcosm  for public campaigns . some of this satirical  docudrama  is now dated  like dick cavett watching the tonight show  but i found much of the dialog funny and insightful  e . g .  you are for real . that means you  re no threat to anyone   . the story isn  t  profound   but i liked it . and the performances are funny  especially cavett  as  himself    lauren bacall as an aging conservative figurehead  glenda jackson  who actually became a member of parliament  as a left wing ideologue  in the opening scene lecturing someone dressed as a carrot on the sanctity of politics   and carol burnett as a basket case . all in the inimitable altman style  although maybe not quite as inimitable as usual . but pretty inimitable .  ,1
i grew up on this classic western series  and as a child always considered it a treat being allowed to stay up late on sunday evenings to watch it . bonanza is still infinitely re watchable in re runs .  br    br   the series chronicles the adventures of the cartwright family  who live on a ranch near virginia city  nevada around the civil war era . their ranch  called the ponderosa  is run and defended by the widowed father  ben  and his unmarried three sons  adam  hoss  and little joe . these three brothers have different mothers  all of whom have passed away years earlier .  br    br   the cartwrights are a hard working  prosperous  and honourable family  highly respected in those parts . the ponderosa is large so reaching its extremities requires a lot of horseback riding . also  trips away are often necessary in order to buy or sell cattle and so forth . needless to say  few of these excursions pass uneventfully . although hospitable  much of the cartwrights  energy must be spent defending their ranch from interlopers  or protecting themselves from townsfolk jealous of their prosperity and stellar reputation . the cartwrights do a fair bit of firing their guns up in the air and such  but only shoot to kill when deemed absolutely necessary . they are involved in various town affairs  even the political life of the nevada territory .  br    br   one of the main assets of the series is the underlying warmth that is always present  despite occasional disagreements  between ben and his three sons  and  despite frequent disagreements  between the three brothers . now  one brother might beat up another every now and then  but generally has a good reason for it at the time and his anger never lasts long  the characters are all very well drawn . ben is portrayed as a successful and noble man of great integrity . the oldest son  adam  the most rational and suave of the brothers  left midway through the series . the middle brother  hoss  is a gentle giant of a teddy bear  who has an insatiable appetite for food and is a little shy around the ladies . the youngest  little joe  is a hot headed  handsome charmer who  by contrast  has quite a way with women . this trio of brothers enjoy various romances but their love interests are typically killed off by the end of the episode or else marriage proves impossible  for whatever reason .  br    br   the actors are all stellar in their roles  including pernell roberts  adam   dan blocker  hoss   michael landon  little joe   and of course lorne greene as the principled family patriarch  ben . i also love the ranch cook  hop sing  played by victor sen yung .  br    br   this is a wonderful action packed western with great values . the cartwrights are always the noble heroes and most of the bad guys quite villainous . if only there were more programs like this vintage western on tv these days   ,1
everybody who wants to be an editor should watch this movie  it shows you about every mistake not to do in editing a movie  my grandma could have done better than that  but that  s not the only reason why this movie is really bad   it  s actually so bad that i  m not able to write a sentence without exclamation mark   if the first episode of les visiteurs  was a quite good familial comedy with funny jokes and cult dialogues  this sequel is copying badly the receipe of the first one . the funny parts could be counted on one hand and maybe half of it . clavier is over  acting his role even more than in the first part  robin is trying to act like lemercier  because she  s replacing her  but that  s grotesque  . lemercier is lemercier  robin is robin  even if muriel robin can be funny by herself on stage  she is not in this movie because she  s not acting as she used to act . i know that it should be hard to replace somebody who was good in a role  lemercier obtained a csar award for her role in the first movie  but she made a big mistake instead of playing her role  she played lemercier playing her role   as for the story  it  s just too much  of course we knew at he end of the first movie that there would be a sequel but poir and clavier should hae tried to write a more simple story like the first episode . the gags are repetitive  childish and dj  vu . no  really  there  s no more than  funny parts in this . the only good things might be the costumes and some special effects . so you have only  reasons to watch it   if you want to learn how to edit awfully a movie    if you want to waste your time or if you really need a brainless moment        ,0
i read all of nancy drew as a preteen and collect the books as a grown  up . i loved the effect used at the end  and a little bit at the beginning  of the movie where line drawings in the style of the books morphed into scenes from the movie . it was a neat way of pointing out connections between situations in the movie and the books . for example  the scenes with the oriental antiques dealer were very reminiscent of many scenarios i remember from the books . i thought ned was perfectly cast  and emma roberts was a wonderful   st century interpretation of nancy drew .  just like the picture of betty crocker  she keeps up with the times    ,1
i voted  for this movie because it looks great as does all of greenaways output . however it was his usual mix of  art  sex and pretentious crap . i know lots of people like this film but i grew tired of it very quickly . it is definitely not for everyone . the ubiquitous mcgregor obviously took the part for crediblity  s sake i guess but he really should not have wasted his time . i hate to consign anyone to pseud  s corner but please . . . . .    on the plus side it is visually very attractive and i enjoyed the music but could not see it through to the end and i cannot say that for many movies . i usually watch the whole thing but this is unbearable    ,0
kenneth branagh  s  hamlet  hits all the marks . the acting is magnificent  the   mm cinematography is gorgeous  the oscar  nominated costumes and sets are stunning  and patrick doyle  s score  also oscar  nominated  is sensitive and moving . oh yeah  the screenplay  by some guy named will s .  isn  t too bad either . film critics ribbed branagh for receiving the films  fourth oscar nod for  adapting  the screenplay  but his decision to use the full text was a gutsy one . i can  t think of many better ways to make four hours fly by .  br    br   nearly every decision branagh makes works brilliantly the use of england  s blenheim palace for exteriors  the edwardian dress  and the staging of  to be or not to be  in a hall of mirrors  to name a few . the casting of hollywood luminaries such as robin williams  billy crystal and jack lemmon in minor parts can be distracting  but that  s nitpicking . the principal cast excels derek jacobi captures the conflicted nature of claudius kate winslet acutely depicts ophelia  s descent into madness julie christie brings passion to her portrayal of gertrude richard briers is pitch  perfect as the conniving polonius and nicholas farrell elevates the potentially thankless role of horatio to the apotheosis of true friendship . every speech  every line  every word is delivered with passion and conviction there isn  t a wasted moment in the entire film . the final scenes magnify the extent of shakespeare  s tragedy in a way not possible with theatrical adaptations .  br    br   branagh  s  hamlet  is a bold  ambitious  and ultimately successful attempt to match the grandeur and poetry of shakespeare  s language with equally eloquent imagery . it  s arguably the greatest shakespearean adaptation ever filmed  strong praise  but well deserved .  ,1
there  s a theory of time that posits that all the moments that ever existed and will exist  actually exist right now . it  s a bit too much to wrap your head around  but perhaps a bit of a comfort to those who wish they could go back to a simpler time and place . for barbara jean trenton  ida lupino   that time was twenty five years earlier  the mid      s when her youth and glamor held the greatest promise . for my part  if i could travel through time  it would be back to the      s when i grew up . maybe to a place like willoughby  but that  s another episode .  br    br   one thing that wouldn  t be so special about     would involve dealing with all that clunky machinery just to watch an episode of  the twilight zone  . how many reels do you think it would take to catalog the entire series  and then find a particular story you wanted to watch  i guess you have to consider the trade offs  convenience versus simplicity  having it right now or taking the time to spool it up to the exact spot where the story begins . popping in a cd has it  s advantages .  br    br   i  m a little surprised that rod serling would pen a story that so closely resembled  sunset boulevard  . ida lupino  s character mirror imaged norma desmond just a bit too closely to be considered an original concept . martin balsam portrays very much a similar character to erich von stroheim  the husband turned butler who  s loyalty is unquestioned . where the story diverges has to do with the way danny  balsam  and sall  ted de corsia  challenge barbara jean to get with reality and clear the cobwebs that paralyze her existence .  br    br   fortunately for us viewers  ida lupino had no such reservations about taking parts that were  not big  but a nice showcase  . it  s a real treat to watch any episode of  the twilight zone  and get to see who pops up from days gone by . sometimes you get a two  fer  like you have here with lupino and balsam  celebrities who sometimes made their mark before the series began  and sometimes after . combined with the stories that the program produced  it  s not surprising that they still manage to entertain so well today .  ,1
so often a band will get together for a re  union concert only to find that they just can  t get it together . not so here . this concert is just shear brilliance from start to finish . these three musicians obviously got together beforehand and plotted and planned what was needed to ensure this was not just a nostalgic bash to satisfy someone  s ego . this is obvious from the start  before they even step on stage . many faces in the crowd weren  t even born when these guys first performed . from the first song they capture that old magic that was cream   men   instruments  no fuss . clapton  by his own admission  said he had to stretch himself for this concert because there were no keyboards  synthesizers etc so we get to see him at his best . ginger baker demonstrates why so many drummers today  speak of him as some sort of drumming guru . jack bruce just great . they really managed to put together a piece of magic that will stand the test of time for many years to come . this one  s a   for me .  ,1
i did enjoy this film  i thought it ended up being an old fashioned love story with a few twists . i expected him to get the girl  i won  t tell you if he does or not you will need to watch the movie to find out . overall if you are looking to watch a love story this one will suffice .  ,1
i liked this movie a lot . the animation was well done and the romance was cute . i liked most of bryan adams  songs and the hans zimmer score was excellent . what a lot of people don  t realize is how well it relates to the heart of darkness  apocalypse now themes  what happens when so  called  civilization  invades someone elses home  what does it mean to be  civilized  etc .  . the opening scenery and music were very stirring . the film is a lament to an america that was once beautiful .  ,1
after viewing  whipped  at a distributor  s screening at the afm the other night  i have to say that i was thoroughly impressed . the audience was laughing all the way through . unfortunately  every territory was already sold  so i did not have the opportunity to purchase the film  but i truly believe that it will be a big hit both domestically and over seas . i agree with the comment that  whipped  should not be pitched as a male  sex and the city   mainly because unlike  sex and the city    whipped  is a satire about dating that never takes itself too seriously .  whipped  pokes fun at relationships in a way that most sex comedies wouldn  t dare . also  the film that i screened at the afm had more of a plot and story than  swingers    clerks   and  sex and the city  combined .  whipped  never slowed down for a beat and provided the audience with non  stop comedy . the performances of amanda peet and the rest of the cast were all rock solid  which only made the film more impressive considering the budget .  ,1
after watching some of hbo  s great stuff  band of brothers  rome  etc .  i must say i had pretty high expectations before watching the first episode of  true blood  . jeez . often the script seemed to be written by an   year  old  some parts are just horribly filmed   the scene in which she  saves  bill  i mean come on . she throws a chain at the guy and ow  it goes around his neck and it magically chokes him  that was pretty embarrassing if you want my opinion . or a few moments before that scene  when she finds out that the couple is gone with bill  ridiculous . she hears them plan their stuff  and like  seconds later  magic  the  of them are gone  and without any struggle or noise or anything   br    br   i mean the idea of the show seemed interesting  mysterious  intriguing  vampires co  existing with human in our modern society . . . but honestly i don  t think they really wanted to make more of this than a petty soap show  that the average teen girl watches all the time but that nobody else cares about . . . unfortunately  the script is written poorly  mediocre at best . it  s shallow and extremely predictable . often i thought that this was some kind of a joke or something .  br    br   the actors deliver really unconvincing performances  if you want my opinion . they seem to take the show very lightly  as if it were some kind of a regular  low budget family tv show  well maybe thats what it is  if you take away the family part  . the only actor that seemed somewhat good to me was stephen moyer in the role of bill  considering the poorly written  extremely short replies he had to say  what are you . . .   can i give you a call sometime . . .   i think he did good in bringing out the somewhat mysteriously scary part of a vampire that anyone with a vampire role must have  actually . anna paquin was okay as well  but not more . but the guy  playing her brother though  jeez  he  s horrible . the scene in which he gets arrested is just simply a shame to modern television . the acting is bad  the construction site looks fake to the bone  and the two other guys  why is he getting arrested  uh . . i dunno . . .  that was pretty embarrassing .  br    br   another thing that i think was completely missed was the way they presented sookie  s psychic powers . they make us hear what people think and speak both at the same time and thats just wrong . often it just seems unnecessarily chaotic  as if people  s thought were some sort of an annoying radio channel  and that when she comes close to em she hits the right frequency level and has to hear everything that they think .  br    br   and finally  the sex scenes are just plainly unnecessary and that vampire sex tape thing was just totally disgusting .  br    br   don  t get me wrong  i wrote all these comments not because i thought the show was bad  but because i was very disappointed . i expected quality stuff . i didn  t think it was going to be like that . it  s definitely not a good show though . mediocre at best .  ,0
ok  you want to test somebody on how comfortable they are with their adolescence and the embarrassing and maniacal changes therin  then get their immediate reaction from watching this uproarious doc about kids making socially relevant horror flicks in the suburban    s . more than any movie i has ever seen  the film deals with burdening sexuality and ego in a way that is completely human  never dull  and flushed in the kind of inherent goodness of youth that is discolored by the fear  frenzied adult world where any quirk in youth is accredited to anything from insanity to perversion . mini  mogul darren stien seems to be reaching for a deeper understanding of his triumphs and misgivings as the patriarch of strict kid  s world . what he finds in himself and others isn  t always pretty  but shows how one can improve and reconcile with age . what does change mean without reflection . i love this movie .  ,1
 . . . but the keyword here is  usually .  i have been known to adore movies everyone thinks are dumb . but in the world of b  rated movies  this one is z  rated . absolutely ridiculous . the thing i respect about most of my favorite b  rated movies are that they don  t take themselves too seriously . the makers of movies like that sort  of treat the movie lightly  even if it  s a heavy topic . i get the impression  however  that the producers of this movie took themselves way to seriously  like they were putting together a    star classic  complete with poor attempts at poignant lines and dumb camera shots . nevertheless  despite all this  i still gave it  out of   stars  as i am biased towards movies like this . if you  re a b  rated fan  however  i would try too hard to find this one .  ,0
this show was absolutely great  and i always look forward to watching it . all the characters were funny and awesome in their own way  each and every episode provided non  stop laughter  and it was completely entertaining and different from a lot of other shows . everybody was just absolutely insane and breathtakingly funny  that you couldn  t help but love this show . there were a few dead weight episodes  but that    s show always managed to create some kind of likable atmosphere  to where it just really didn  t matter . this was one of the best shows to ever be aired  and i will watch this show anytime i can  for it never gets old  never gets unfunny  and never gets uninteresting .  ,1
i got the dvd very cheap and i  m a total drewbie  and thats probably the only constellation where this movie could ever interest anyone .  br    br   an early drew movie  she  s looking great  and she gets a quite lot of really cute scenes of her  like a shower scene  a sexy dance scene  quite a number of sexy outfits etc . she does never show the friendly charm we know from her more recent movies .  br    br   the movie itself is pretty average or sub  average  and much more looking like being made for the tv than one for the cinema . there is no real horror or tension built up and the dialogs are often cheesy .  br    br   the most interesting part is probably the end because i honestly don  t understand it . but maybe there is nothing to understand about it anyway . but at least you don  t get the end you would be expecting  and it also comes much sooner than one would have expected .  br    br   overall i think this movie is exclusively for drewbies .  ,0
this is the second movie based on the life and times of ultra hung porn star  john curtis estes  better known as john holmes . boogie nights is also roughly based on his life . maybe someday someone is going to do a movie on the life of tommy byron instead .  br    br   the problem is  that the story is not very well told . there are many law  order episodes that have more twists and turns than wonderland  and the director never gets the criminal case going with any kind of gusto . val kilmer has two problems  he is not nearly as hung as holmes is  and no prosthesis this time around  unlike in boogie nights   and he is much better looking than mope holmes .  br    br   the director does not introduce one single likable individual among the cast . the racist  immature lowlifes he hangs out with  or his wife  and the police don  t get much in the way of characterization .  br    br   the best part of the movie is eric bogosian telling paris hilton to  get lost  .  br    br   having said all that  anyone interested in the sleaziest side of the porn business in the     s or true crime shouldn  t miss it .  ,1
the fact that this movie made it all the way to the rentalrack in norway is bizarre . this movie is just awful . this image quality is just one teeny bit better than you get of a mobile phone and the plot is soooo bad . the main character is just plain annoying and the rest just suck . every person affiliated with this movie should be ashamed . the fact that the people that made this movie put their name on this is extraordinary . and the distributors did they even see it   this is probably the worst movie i have ever seen . to label this a comedy is an insult to mankind . i urge you not to support this movie by buying or renting it .  ,0
unimaginably stupid  redundant and humiliating closure to the  nightmare on elm street   series  part  is so incompetent that it looks like director rachel talalay intentionally wanted to turn wes craven  s initial premise into one big bad and tasteless joke . this isn  t just the worst entry in the  elm street  saga it  s also one of the most embarrassing horror movies ever made and it downright offends fans of the genre  the story is dumb  the character drawings are ridiculous  the structure is all murky and  most of all  the special and visual effects resemble those of a tom  jerry cartoon . the sequences in which freddy krueger murders his victims are endless and very uninteresting . were we supposed to be petrified when a jabbering freddy turned breckin meyer into a video game  character and pogo  sticked him around the walls of a house  the story takes us back to springwood and it appears that freddy all of a sudden has a middle  aged daughter . you  d think he would mention that in one of his previous adventures  but no there  s only one teenage  survivor in springwood and krueger uses him to get into contact with his long lost daughter . another reason why this final installment is so awful is the completely illogical structure . the john doe  boy is introduced as the leading character but then all of a sudden he dies and the plot continues to revolve on two adults  how about that freddy krueger  who spent five entire films killing nothing but teenagers  eventually gets beaten by two adults wearing  d  glasses  sort of like ruins the whole essence  doesn  t it  as far as i  m concerned   nightmare on elm street  has always been a dreadfully overrated series but  up until now  even the weakest entries had at least some redeeming elements .  freddy  s dead   however  is simply unendurable and nobody should waste his  her precious time watching it .  ,0
studio     aka the possessed in the uk  is another sub  par slasher that has the appearance of a straight  to  dvd movie .  br    br   whilst many of the straight  to  dvd movies are fast  paced or unintentionally hilarious in the so  bad  it  s  good sense  studio    is a lamentable failure .  br    br   at the time of writing  every comment on the first page includes a negative rating and a negative review . every one of these people have hit the nail on the head .  br    br   the two people  at the time of writing  who wrote comments with a rating of   out of   should not be taken seriously . obviously they  ve seen few slasher movies and have an even more limited understanding of horror .  br    br   the only really positive point i can make about this movie is that it does fare better than the choke and one of them  two extremely mediocre slasher movies that i would not wish on my worst enemy   br    br   the plot of this movie must have been done hundreds  if not thousands of times . the movie only has a slight twist  and one that is badly handled  to the usual expectations . a depressed singer commits suicide . soon after  her spirit returns to possess one of her surviving friends . the said possessed friend goes on a killing spree . the rest of the plot really is too bizarre to sum up . you  ll just have to see it for yourself  providing your interest has not yet waned to the point of extinction of course .  br    br   the acting in the movie is very poor for the most part . the actress who played dora was an exception to this . her character was always interesting and seductive when she was on the screen . she helps to elevate the movie above similar contemporary efforts . unfortunately  some of the lines she was given to say were badly written to put it mildly and thus prevent her from saving the movie .  br    br   the direction was equally poor . the villains did not seem the least bit menacing  every killing was totally devoid of suspense or tension  atmosphere was non  existent and the camera  work was incredibly basic . some of the special effects  if you can call them that  reminded me of the tv series  ghost stories . unfortunately for the producers of this movie  ghost stories had intelligently written scripts  believable performances and made superb use of camera angles . maybe if the producers had watched that tv series closely  they  d have picked up some more techniques that might have saved this excuse for a movie   br    br   the music is completely unsuited to the tone of the movie . it  s just rock music and not the best examples of this type either . don  t get me started on that awful song played at the beginning   br    br   some aspects of the movie  particularly dialogue  are unintentionally funny . unfortunately they are not funny enough to move the movie up  or should it be down  to the so  bad  it  s  good level .  br    br   overall  studio    is a mundane mediocre slasher with very little noteworthy aspects . i recommend this only to those who are fans of straight  to  dvd movies and have a desire to see every single slasher ever made .  ,0
i thought that my favorite martian was very boring and drawn out   it was not funny at all . the audience just sat through the whole movie and didn  t laugh at all    not even the kids laughed   that is sad for a disney movie   i thought they could have found somebody better to play the martian rather than christopher lloyd   he was really stupid   and he was not funny   i thought the talking suit was really dumb    in the original television series the suit doesn  t talk and move around   in my opinion they should not have wasted their time on this movie   i give it two thumbes down   really a waste of time and i would not recommend the movie to anybody    thank you    ,0
plot is never the strong point of a fred astaire and ginger rogers movie  but  follow the fleet   s screenplay is exceptionally mediocre . fred and ginger still come off all right   they play  bake  baker and sherry martin  dancers whose personal and professional partnership ended when bake joined the navy . when they meet again  their love  hate relationship generates some entertaining comic moments . but for much of the movie  they take a backseat to a tedious subplot about sherry  s sister connie  harriet hilliard   her love for sailor bilge smith  randolph scott   bilge  s dalliance with another woman  and an old schooner that connie inherited from her father . though hilliard is rather charming  this plot is uninteresting .  br    br   but at the same time   follow the fleet  is blessed with an exceptional irving berlin score that gives the stars plenty of chances to show off their talents . astaire gets two good solos with  we saw the sea  and  i  d rather lead a band .  he sings expressively and  of course  dances electrifyingly   and the sailor suit makes him look a little more boyish and athletic than usual . rogers sings the catchy  let yourself go  and later does a solo tap  dance to the same tune .  br    br   the three duets really save the film  even though they  re all shoehorned into the plot with silly excuses . fred and ginger win a dance contest by doing an energetic routine to another reprise of  let yourself go  . later  they sing and dance  i  m putting all my eggs in one basket  as if it were an early rehearsal of the number  flubbing the choreography to comic effect . at the end  the movie finally figures out how to get fred and ginger in evening clothes for a romantic duet   it makes it part of a show  within  the  show . the situation is contrived  but the song   let  s face the music and dance   is one of the most sinuously beautiful things berlin ever wrote  it  s reminiscent of cole porter   and the dancing matches it in elegance . quintessential astaire and rogers .  br    br   it would be a chore to sit through most of the dialogue sections of  follow the fleet  again  and  in fact  it  s not necessary  because the plot rarely propels the musical numbers . but i could watch the songs over and over .  ,1
at one end of the eighties warren beatty created and starred in the literate epic reds about the founding of the soviet union as seen through the eyes of iconoclast radical john reed . it was a profound film both entertaining and with a message presented by an all star cast . at the end of the decade warren beatty created another kind of epic in dick tracy that makes no pretense to being anything other than entertainment with a whole bunch of the best actors around just having a great old time hamming it up under tons of makeup .  br    br   that both reds and dick tracy could come from the same individual speaks volumes about the range this man has as a player . in this film beatty managed to get all the famous cartoon characters from the strip and put them in one original screenplay .  br    br   the city  s top mobster big boy caprice is making a move to really eliminate competition . the film opens with him rubbing out lips manlis  s henchmen in a valentine massacre style shooting and then lips himself being fitted for a cement overcoat . but caprice  s moves are making him a target for tracy .  br    br   in the meantime a third mysterious and faceless individual is looking to topple caprice himself . will our hero sort out this thicket of crime   br    br   the spirit of fun this film has is truly infectious . when people like al pacino  dustin hoffman  paul sorvino  william forsythe  r . g . armstrong get themselves outrageously made  up to look like the cartoon creations of strip author chester gould and then indulge in an exercise of carving the biggest slice of ham  you  ve got to love this film .  br    br   al pacino got a nomination for best supporting actor  but any of these guys could have  it  s only that pacino as big boy caprice gets the most screen time . only beatty plays it completely straight  the others all seem to play off of him . dick tracy won oscars for best artset design  best song written by stephen sondheim and introduced by madonna  sooner or later . the fact he was even able to get somebody like sondheim to write a score for this film only shows sondheim wanted to get in on the fun . as for madonna  the material girl does more than hold her own with all these acting heavyweights as club torch singer breathless mahoney .  br    br   before this film  dick tracy movies were consigned to the b pictures and worse as saturday afternoon serials . the only thing that rivals this all star extravaganza is a radio broadcast done for armed forces radio during world war ii that got to vinyl . can you believe a cast like bing crosby  bob hope  frank sinatra  dinah shore  jimmy durante  judy garland  frank morgan  and the andrews sisters  try and find a recording of that gem .  br    br   until then warren beatty  s classic comic strip for the big screen will do nicely .  ,1
ok this movie was really  unique  shall we say . carrie fisher was by far the most talented in the movie  even though it is said she had a coke problem during the movie . but she said that she can  t remember to much of it . well thats her excuse but whats everyone else  s    i can  t imagine they all had a coke problem . whatever it wasn  t all that bad i mean i guess the plot was ok and it had some pretty funny moments . although the part where the guy gets that thing shoved in his head was a little too violent for my taste . oh well i guess i was disappointed cause carrie fisher is like so awesome and this movie did nothing for her .  ,0
although cameron grant was clearly hired to replace andrew blake over at ultimate pictures when the latter started his own company  studio a   he practically outdid the  master  right out of the gate when it came to setting up steamy sex scenes . so  while all the window dressing blake had pioneered  starlets in fetish lingerie and sun glasses  coiffed and made up as if they  re about to hit the catwalk  remained very much present and accounted for  grant added his own personal spin to the carnal content . in doing so  he raised the heat to a level that had eluded big a ever since his first  and imho best  film night trips . cam  s maiden effort  elements of desire  might still have been handicapped by an overly slavish adherence to the blake aesthetic  with a surfeit of girl on girl gropes   but his subsequent dinner party already shows him at the top of his form in what must surely rank as his masterpiece .  br    br   the title spells out the premise as a group of well to do friends and acquaintances gather over dinner to swap sexy stories  with an extended orgy at the conclusion . scrumptious juli ashton and tammy parks smear food stuff all over each other  s flawless physiques in their kitchen sequence that is sure to delight those with a taste towards combining pleasures of the palette with those of the flesh . busty crystal gold  here   catalina   was rarely more than a reliable second  stringer  adding spice to several ona zee bargain basement noirs  yet looks absolutely stunning here in a romantic four poster frolic with fabio lookalike vince voyeur . beautiful blondes kylie ireland and yvonne  making out with marc davis  for the record  the latter two were an item at the time  under a waterfall  complete the eye candy section of the movie .  br    br   time to get cooking  early jenna jameson   daisy  back then  foreshadows the greatness to come as she drains frank towers   mark slade  on his subsequent shift to the gay side of the industry  of all vital juices  albeit with a little help from brunette diva for effective contrast  the scene  s stylish industrial setting providing an atmospheric backdrop to the full tilt sex taking place . impossibly hunky construction worker gerry pike seeks to cool off on a sweltering summer day by hosing down  a prospect too tantalizing for prim  n  proper business woman asia carrera  at her all time most achingly pretty  to pass up . best of show must be the imaginative sequence that has nasty norma jeane and handsome sean michaels teasing the pants off each other  for starters   while separated by a glass partition right until the predictably splashy conclusion .  br    br   with sex that proves either artsy or hot  and more often than not both  grant has concocted a veritable smrgsbord of fleshy wares to continue the film  s gastronomic analogy the title implies . couples may be the prime intended audience  but an alternation between naughty  n  nice should rightfully include that  something for everything  recipe so many adult features are aiming for . acting as his own dop  the director shows great eye for detail  like the shot of asia carrera  s pristine white shoes being spattered with mud  enriching his vision . this marks him out as a great filmmaker rather than a merely serviceable one  as was the case with nick steele who stepped up to take his place at ultimate  effectively making him a replacement  s replacement   when he packed up for greener pastures .  ,1
it was a disappointment to see this dvd after so many years . for me the main problem  s the uneven script .  br    br   while some of it is witty and hip  quite a bit of it is dull  unfunny and lifeless . many of the gags just sit there  lacking spark and energy .  br    br   of the cast  mae west and rachel welch come over well . roger herren in the role of rusty shines  too bad he didn  t make more films  . but for my money  there  s just too much of john huston  and poor rex reed isn  t hardly given a fighting chance . his character seems relegated to skim around on the sidelines  wondering what he  s doing in this film .  br    br   the low user rating should give an idea as to the public  s opinion of this piece . vidal  s original provided much potential that was pretty much wasted . not even the  classic  film clips did much . all in all a rather sub par effort  and it  s not likely to get much better with time .  ,0
  spoiler included  some would say   br    br   this film is not possible to take seriously . at some parts it is so awfully stupid that i just can  t help laughing at it all . try me for the sequence where stallone  s character jumps some   meters with full climbing gear or  and this is really my favorite  snuffs a bad guy by sticking him onto a stalactite . yeah  what ungodly strength did he muster to accomplish such feats  i dunno  but he sure gives reality a run for the money .  ,0
  diary of sex addict  is a pathetic attempt at a serious drama about sexual compulsiveness . probably a movie marketing scam  this flick is a stylish shoot with a good cast and little else going for it . bottom line   diary . . .  would have us believe that our sex addict character has the dumbest wife in the world  a stable of babes on the side who have nothing better to do than drop their panties for him at his whim  and no job in spite of being a restaurateur . at the best  this flick could have been good drama . at the worst  cheap softcore .  diary . . .  isn  t either and nowhere in between . this one  s for the dumpster .  d    ,0
the   th animated disney classic is a reasonable movie told through a simple story . even though a little dated  it deserves a place in the list of disney classics .  br    br   it  s not among disney  s top works  but is satisfying . one of disney  s most  simple  works  yes  but keeps a certain magic and enchantment  which old disney is well known for  . this was an important movie because it saved disney from a delicate situation . if this was a failure  there wouldn  t be any more disney animated classics .  br    br    cinderella  is somehow like a return to disney  s  st animated classic   snow white and the seven dwarfs   because it brings back the fairy tale genre . it  s not clear where the story takes place  but i suppose it  s somewhere in france because this is based in a tale by charles perrault .  br    br   there are plenty of likable characters  such as cinderella  the prince  bruno  the dog   jaques and gus  the two main mice   the fairy godmother  for a fairy she sure is funny   the birds  the king and the grand duke .  br    br   jaques is very smart and amusing . i love his voice . really has that mouse  like quality . gus might not be that smart  but he  s humorous .  br    br   the king is hilarious  but i think that what makes him so funny is his short temper . the grand duke is a very cool chap and funny too . they  re two of my favorite characters in this film and responsible for many of the most amusing moments .  br    br   the prince is certainly one of the most charming in disney . no doubt that prince philip from  sleeping beauty  was inspired on this prince  because they are very similar  looking .  br    br   on the other hand  lady tremaine  the stepmother  isn  t supposed to be likable because she  s cold  jealous  bitter and cruel . her daughters  anastacia and drizella  aren  t much better than her . however  the stepmother isn  t as annoying as her ugly and selfish daughters . cinderella  the main character  has nothing to do with them . cinderella is gentle  kind  pretty and lovable . by the way  i think her beautiful pink dress is much nicer than the one given by the fairy godmother .  br    br   lucifer  the cat  is hilariously malicious . the way he walks  sticking up his nose in the air and those arrogant and snobbish facial expressions make him funny . ironically he  s very much like the stepmother when it comes to personality . he always agrees with the stepmother  s attitudes towards cinderella . lucifer has the right name for him because he  s such a devilish and mean cat . yet  there  s nothing annoying about him .  br    br   the soundtrack is simple but pleasant  although not among disney  s best . the best song in this movie is  bibiddi bobiddi boo  .  br    br   there are plenty of well known talented voice actors in this  such as james macdonald  marion darlington  eleanor audley  verna felton and luis van rooten .  br    br   despite being simple  looking  the movie has good artwork  as well as its nice details  although never something  out  of  this  world  . however  the king  s palace is a spectacular masterpiece  being truly majestic and colossal .  ,1
i like david hamilton  s artistic photographs of nude women at the border of womanhood  sometimes erotic  though never pornographic . someone else liked them  too  because my david hamilton books were stolen . in one book were seen a few pictures of a young boy  obviously nude  intimate with a young woman older than he  also nude . though discrete  there was strong sexual connotation . new territory for david hamilton which proved to be either stills from the movie tendres cousines or perhaps photos taken on set .  br    br   the art of still photography unfortunately does not automatically translate to cinematography . soft focus becomes out  of  focus and discrete angles become confusing  perhaps because  in motion  they cannot be considered . you either see it or miss it and there  s no time to observe  to comprehend . the movie is supposed to be a farce  and funny things do happen  but it doesn  t  hang together   perhaps because the story develops so slowly and one may wonder just what  s going on . eventually  the    year  old julien has intercourse with his cousin  but it  s soft core  with no genital contact shown on camera . since it  s a farce  we have a disappointing virgin and an embarrassing caught in the act gag and  having caught them  julien  s father even gives him a cigarette to complete the experience . in fairness  the film is in french and conforms to french cinematic forms  which may just be too subtle for most americans even with english subtitles to help us phillistines along .  br    br   it  s been suggested that this film is child pornography and that certainly results from today  s climate where sexual exploitation of children is clearly a serious problem . nobody in their right mind wants to endorse or appear to endorse the sexual abuse of children  so there  s practically no room left for children to be seen in even the mildest erotic context without immediately activating alarms over sexual violence and exploitation . guys will think  lucky julien   even as they agree that sex and children in the movies is a  bad thing   all the while still wishing they could have been a julien at that age . women  too  may have similar thoughts  but all such considerations must be pushed out of one  s conscious mind . hysterically  the worst assumptions have become automatic and matters of children and sex are rigorously avoided . too bad  since sexual awakening is a real human experience . afer all  children do grow up and become sexual beings as julien does . it  s a fit literary subject  cinema included  but taboo under the threat of sexual violence against children . david hamilton  i think  was taking a risk to make a movie on this topic even in     . he was somewhat successful at exploring this sensitive topic  and  unfortunately  we  re unlikely to see better in the near future for fear of the child pornography label .  ,1
this movie of    minutes was aired by the italian public television during the early seventies . it tells you the myth attributed to homer of the journey home of odysseus after the troy war . it is an epic story about the ancient minoan and mycenaean civilizations  told at list    years after those events toke place  around     bc .  br    br   this is a     movie  so if you buy the dvd version you would find that the sound is just mono and there is no other language than italian  even the close caption is in italian . pity . many people would enjoy this masterpiece if it had at list the english subtitles . but if this is not a problem for you  than i would strongly recommend to watch this movie .  ,1
this was a very entertaining movie and i really enjoyed it  i don  t normally rent movies like these  ie . indie flicks  however  i was attracted to the film because it had an incredible cast which included jamie kennedy  whom i have loved since the scream trilogy . the movie director took a risk  and it is a risky risk  in telling the lives of many  and i mean many  different people and having the intertwine at various intervals . taking that risk was a good idea because it  s end result is an exceedingly good film .  br    br   the film has a few main characters dwight  jamie kennedy   a disgruntled fortune cookie writer whose relationship with his girlfriend is on the rocks because of an argument . wallace gregory  john carroll lynch   an airplane loader  technician who has a love for all living things  except  perhaps meter maids  and who despite his good heart has an increasing amount of bad luck . cyr  brian cox   the owner of a chinese restaurant  donut shop who is a germaphobe and because of is his fear of germs places his assistant  cook sung   alexis cruz  under pressure to keep up with his phobia . ernie   christopher bauer  is married to olive   christina kirk  who he is convinced is trying to stop him have fun  look ridiculous  go insane  and not live a normal life . they begin to have petty and almost crazy arguments and olive seriously begins to have doubts about ernie . gordon   grant heslov  is a man whose life isn  t going very well  as bad things begin to add up in his life he decides to take it in hand . mitchel   jon huertas  is convinced that gwen   alexandra westcourt  is the girl of his dreams and that they are destined for each other  though she is more skeptical . he attempts to woo her every chance he gets and he certainly makes attempts  johnston   michael hitchcock  has just been fired from his job and has doubts about his role as provider  he takes another job that he just isn  t suited for . his wife annelle   arabella field  is comforting through out his job loss experience until she learns that johnston wasn  t quite the loving husband she thought he was .  br    br   all in all i definitely suggest this movie   br    br    erica  ,1
like other people who commented on  frulein doktor  i stumbled by chance upon this little gem on late  night tv without having heard of it before . the strange mixture of a pulp fiction story about a sexy but unscrupulous anti  heroine on the one hand and a realistic and well  researched portrayal of war in the trenches on the other hand had me hooked from the beginning .  br    br   to me this is one of the five best movies about wwi  the others are  all quiet on the western front    paths of glory    gallipoli  and the post  war  la vie et rien d  autre   . and the scene with the poison gas attack is really chilling the horses and men appear like riders of the apocalypse with their gas masks .  br    br   i only wish i had taped the film .  ,1
the script for  scary movie   just wasn  t ready to go . this is a problem with the film that is blatantly evident  to the actors and the audience alike . director keenan ivory wayans  and many of the actors are funny people and so the movie isn  t completely humorless . to their credit  the film has several funny moments . but as a whole   scary movie   is not even close to being as clever and amusing as the original .  br    br   the first  scary movie  was a laugh a minute film . it turned the smallest subtleties of the slasher film genre into comedic gold . the humor in  scary movie   is as heavy handed as it is un  original . they even miss obvious opportunities for parody . two of the movies stars are former cast members of  beverly hills        and this was a show that was begging to be parodied  in the final analysis   scary movie   is like a fine bottle of wine that was opened far too soon . the script needed a lot more time to age .  stars out of  .  ,0
gordon parks  the prolific black life magazine photographer  made a true ticking  timebomb of a movie here  one that does not mess around  based upon the true story of two nyc cops  later dubbed batman and robin  who singlehandedly employed radical tactics to clean up their precinct neighborhood of drugs  this is a cop  buddy movie before that term became a repetitive formula . lightning paced  there is not one unimportant throwaway scene here .  br    br   man  early    s nyc must have been a terrible place to be a police officer  from the looks of movies like this and  serpico .  these two cops start out as safety  division rookies  busting dealers in plainclothes in their spare time . but instead of receiving applause from the city police department  they receive nothing but resistance and antagonism from their peers . they have to singlehandedly navigate a minefield of police and legal corruption  boneheaded assignments meant to keep them from their work on the streets  ruthless drug kingpins  and a nasty ghetto neighborhood .  br    br   both david selby and ron leibman are fantastic in the leads part of the entertainment is watching leibman  s eyes darting around crazily in every scene in what is a flawless comic performance  and selby  s acting is low  key and wry . these two make all the comedy aspects of the story work  displaying a palpable frustration mixed with gutsy determination . director parks  who was already known for his coverage of controversial subjects in his photography  does not shy away from the grittiness of the story . rather  the movie is uncompromising in portrayal of the toughness of the world of police and streets criminals that these two men inhabit . adding to this realism is the fact that the real hantz and greenberg acted as technical advisors for the film  and even appear in surreal cameo roles as two fellow officers who ridicule the protagonists . it is a real tribute to the effectiveness of parks  direction that he manages to perfectly balance this depressing mileu with bright comedy .  br    br   why has mgm  ua let this sit on the shelf for   years  barely giving it a home video or dvd release in the u . s  it is a minor masterpiece from the     s .  ,1
the odd couple is a comic gem . one the funniest script ever committed to celluloid  exceeded only by strangelove  spinal tap and lebowski  lemmon and matthau are best friends obsessive compulsive felix and sloppy  irresponsible oscar . oscar  s wife has already left him because he is impossible to live with due to his irresponsible attitude . felix  s wife leaves him at the start of the movie  and after an aborted suicide attempt he moves in with poker buddy oscar . thats when the fun begins .  br    br   the entire script is brilliant and filled with brilliant one  liners . you are probably already familiar with the  f . u .  joke but it still works brilliantly due to matthau  s comic timing .  br    br   my favorite moments are when lemmon tries to clear his sinus in the diner and when the pigeon sisters are being charmed by a very suave matthau and lemmon is totally out of his element . this one requires repeat viewings   ,1
lubitsch  s last production but not his least interesting film . somehow largely ignored by critics as he couldn  t finish it himself and as the movie wasn  t co  signed by preminger who he did most of the staging . . . a very strange mix of musical  a remembrance of the merry widow   and classic lubitsch touch sentimentalism  an impossible love  story like cluny brown  yet a very clever and intelligent one yet not to be understood as some nostalgia of some lost world but rather a testament on eternal feelings prevailing on the foolishness of mankind and especially men in times of war with a  moral  lesson still true today as it was in     . billy wilder as an answer to preminger who grieved at lubitsch  s funerals about having lost a great man replied that we still had his films and that sums it all up about that lady in ermine . . .  ,1
when my wife and i decided to watch this movie we thought it couldn  t fail . i love billy crystal  my wife loves julia roberts and everyone we talked to said they loved it .  br    br   we were misled  in spades .  br    br   on my part  i felt billy crystal  s character was extremely one  dimensional and did very little for the film . sure  he cracked a couple of good jokes  but as a character he did nothing but take up space .  br    br   and poor julia roberts . in past shows she plays well as a strong  willed  self  determined lady . in this flick  she seems completely repressed and had very little fire . this is not the julia roberts that my wife enjoys watching .  br    br   ok  if i were to find one good thing  it would have to be christopher walken . now that  s entertainment . but  just like billy crystal  hardly anything is shown of his character .  br    br   if you  re looking for a night of mindless laughs with very little redeeming value  go see it . but if you  re looking for a smart  romantic comedy  this is not your film . it  s none of the above .  ,0
this film was absolutely brilliant   every performance in this film is excellent  especially jake gyllenhaal and chris cooper . it looks like mr gyllenhaal will have a huge film career if this is anything to go by . i thought that joe johnston was an odd choice as director as he is usually associated woth big budget blockbusters  jumanji  honey i shrunk the kids  . he pulls of every scene with sheer class . my favourite scene was where homer is going down the mineshaft and looking at the sky  going down  as all of his dreams were  it was beautiful . joe johnston should direct more of these brilliant  acting driven films as well as his big budget blockbuster faire  which is also excellent . kudos   to all involved in this masterpiece   ,1

godard once said a way to criticize a movie is to just make one  and probably the strongest kind that could be made about ralph bakshi  s take on tolkien  s magnum opus the lord of the rings  has actually been made by peter jackson . the recent trilogy  to me  aren  t even total masterpieces  but they are given enough room with each book to breath in all the post  modern techniques crossed with classical storytelling to make them very good  sweeping entertainments .  br    br   but as one who has not read the books  i end up now looking upon the two versions  live  action  albeit partly animated in its big visual effects way  and animated  albeit partly done with actual live action as the framework  in relation to just the basic story  not even complete faithfulness to the books . and with bakshi  s version  it  s almost not fair in a way  as what we do see is really not the complete vision  not what jackson really had  probably final cut  . robbed of return of the king  s big climactic rush of the story  and with the other two parts becoming rushed  i ended up liking it more for what it did within its limitations  though as such those same limitations make it disappointing .  br    br   what  s interesting too  after seeing the jackson films first  which i also slightly regret being that i might  ve reacted to this differently when i was younger and prior to five years ago  is that the basic elements of the story never get messed up with . everything that is really needed to tell the fellowship of the ring story is actually pretty much intact  and if anything what was probably even more gigantic and epic in tolkien  s book is given some clarity in this section . the actors playing the parts of the hobbits and the other heroes  are more or less adequate for the parts  with a few parts standing out  john hurt as aragorn and william squire as gandalf  .  br    br   the lack of extra characterization does end up making things seem a little face  value for those who  ve not even seen the other films or read the books and can  t put them into context . but there is some level of interest always with the characters  and here there  s a more old  fashioned sensibility amid the large aura of it being more . this is not a garden variety disney adaptation  warts and all  this is a bakshi film  with his underground animation roots colliding with the mythical world of middle earth .  br    br   and what bakshi and his animation team bring to the film is one that ends up giving what is on screen  in all its abbreviated form  its hit or miss appeal . along with being not totally complete as a film  or as stories  the form of the film is an experiment  to see if something can be entirely rotoscoped . the results end up bringing what seems now to be retro  but at the time of course was something that was a rough  crazy inspiration on the part of the filmmakers . might it have been better with more traditional drawn animation  in some parts  yeah it does become a little noticeable  as was also the case in bakshi  s american pop  that the main characters move in such ways that are a little shaky  like some kind of comic  book form done in a different way . still  there  s much i admired in what was done .  br    br   the orcs  for example  i found to be really amazing in they  re surreal surroundings . they  re maybe the best part of the combination of the animation on top of the live  action  especially during parts where there isn  t battle footage  that  s really the real hit  or  miss section  as there isn  t continuity from the good and bad rotoscoping   and the chiaroscuro comes through with big shapes on top of horseback . it  s creepy in a good way . and the backgrounds  while also very rough and sometimes too sketchy  are beautiful with the mixtures and blasts of colors together . it  s almost something for art  film buffs as much as for the ring  nuts .  br    br   so  how would i recommend this animated take on the lord of the rings  i don  t know  to tell the truth . it  s certainly a good notch above the other tolkien animated film i  ve seen  the hobbit  and i  ve yet to see the animated rotk   and there is some real artistry going on . there  s also some stilted dialog  an all  too  rushed two towers segment with the most intriguing character gollum being reduced to maybe two scenes in all . and seeing something as fragmented like this ends up only reinforcing the completeness of the more recent films .  br    br   if you  re a fan of the books contemplating checking this out  i would say it  s worth a chance  even if it  s one of those chances where you watch for forty minutes and then decide whether to stop it or not . as for it fitting into bakshi  s other films i  ve seen it  s an impressive ambitious and spotty achievement  where as with lynch  s dune it  s bound to draw a dark  mordor  like line in the sand between those who hate it passionately and those who don  t . i don  t .  ,1

this was by far the worst low budget horror movie i have ever seen . i am an open minded guy and i always love a good horror movie . in fact  when i  m renting movies i specifically look for some good underrated horror movies . they are always good for a laugh  believe i know  i have seen many . but this movie was just so terrible it wasn  t worth a chuckle . i was considering turning it off in the first five minutes . . . which i probably should have . there is nothing good about it  first and foremost  the camera crew suck  d a . the intro was stupid just like the ending . acting and special effects were terrible . please i  m begging you  do not watch this movie  you will absolutely hate it .  ,0
an unmarried  twenty  something hick  played by john travolta  leaves the farm and goes to houston  where he learns about life and love in a texas honky  tonk . at face value  it  s a modern love story . . . texas style . there  s gobs of cowboy hats  pickup trucks  neon beer signs  and references to big belt  buckles and rodeos . the music  if not texas native  is texas adapted  courtesy of the talents of mickey gilley  johnny lee  and the charlie daniels band . and that texas twang . . .  y  all  .  br    br   the story and the characters are about as subtle as the taste of texas five  alarm chili made with jalapeno peppers . it  s enough to make civilized viewers abort the film in favor of a genteel classic  one starring laurence olivier or ingrid bergman  maybe .  hamlet  it  s not . but  urban cowboy  is spicy and explicit  and i kinda like it .  br    br   technically  the film is generally good . the dialogue  the production design  and the costumes are all realistic the editing is skillful . and both the casting and the acting are commendable  if not oscar worthy . i would not have cast travolta in the role he plays  but he does a fine job . . . ditto debra winger . barry corbin and brooke alderson  among others  are good too  in support roles . but  the cinematography seemed weak . the film copy i watched was grainy  and at times suffered from a reddish  orange tint  a visual trait i have noticed in other films from the same time period .  br    br   at first glance  the film does not seem to offer any social or political  message  . but i would argue that when  urban cowboy  was released twenty  five years ago  it had rather prophetic implications . in     the u . s . had all kinds of problems  not the least being american hostages held by iran . in the minds of a lot of folks back then  the u . s . was being pushed around  bullied .  br    br   this film  along with others of its time  offered something that americans wanted to see in their political leaders . . . toughness .  urban cowboy  is a very physical film . the characters in it may not be the brightest people on earth . but  they  re tough   br    br   everything about  urban cowboy  is anti  intellectual . as a vehicle for cultural expression then  this     film was one of several that augured a new get  tough era for the u . s . it started in     with the election of reagan . and that era continues to this day  with a president who probably will not be remembered for his intellect  but will be remembered for his toughness and aggression  traits that americans seem to gravitate to as surely as texans to five  alarm chili .  ,1
simply  one of the funiest movies i  ve ever seen . it  s a parody of crime  life  parody of everything that represents the chicago     .  there is no realy need to underestimate this movie because rating is under  . its a opinion of a mass  and mass is hypnotized . who decide to watch it  it will regret  who decide not to watch it  will regret more .  ,1
when i was six yo  i learned about a series called  los campeones   and even if i was just a kid i did everything i need to convince my parents to let me watch  the champions  and  the avengers  once every week . i think that was the golden age of english series . . .  i already own the complete cycle of  the prisoner    but lasted also a few years later with  the tomorrow people    the worst witch   i just me  or this is  harry potter  in girl  of course  before as much as i want  the campions  to be in zone  or zone   i  m also waiting for  dr . who   pack the whole series in a set of  uhm  maybe    dvd  s  please  i couldn  t expend more for it      people of tomorrow   and several other  low budget   but great stories to be available within my reached zones . i speak and understand english  but not all my relatives do  including my parents  whom introduced me into these great stories . . . i hope someday  someone could feel the attraction of these series and then could sell them as i originally view them . . . dubbed or subtitled  but in the same format i saw them . remember  zone  or  are ok with my tv set   ,1
i have seen this film numerous times and for the life of me  i cannot understand why some people compare this to babe . this film is not about the secret life of all animals who secretly can talk . instead  it is about a parrot who learns to talk to help his owner  a little girl with a serious stammer  overcome her speech impediment only to be separated from her in a heart  wrenching scene early on . then the great journey begins . paulie the parrot sets out to try and find his one great friend  marie .  br    br   along the way  he meets several wonderful people and numerous nasty people . he falls in love with a girl parrot and loses her . he gets conned into a life of crime and then captured by a bad scientist who wants to exploit him .  br    br   he recounts his tale to a sympathetic janitor in the lab who agrees to help him escape and find his beloved marie .  br    br   tony shaloub shines as the kindly janitor who has an open mind and big heart and who determines to help little paulie despite the risks . jay mohr plays the voice of the parrot and one of the seedy characters he comes across .  br    br   there is a little suggestive language but this film is appropriate for most kids and even more so if the parents join in on the fun and watch too . it is a witty  clever  epic animal  adventure story and ultimately a great love story about a bird and his little girl . he search for marie ends with a quite an unexpected surprise for most people who dont know much about parrots .  br    br   kids who have seen the wild green parrot tribes in los angeles and pasadena will especially benefit from seeing this film and understanding that birds  especially parrots are not disposable pets . all children everywhere  will see that pets form deep attachments themselves and that the love and loyalty of a dog or parrot is a gift to be treasured .  br    br   so no babe here  more of an incredible journey with a twist .  br    br   enjoy and try no to tear up during the sad parts .  ,1
a sentimental story with a sentimental sound track . it  s about a little girl  with a voice impediment  who treasures her green parrot paulie . the parrot thinks and talks like a human being and gives help and advice to his constant companion .  br    br   the parrot is definitely the star of the film . at times mischievous and at times in fits of depression the bird captures the mood in a most remarkable and expressive way . the synchronised voice too is very well done and within a minute or two you can actually believe that this intelligent little bird exists .  br    br   early in the film her father gives the bird to a pawnbroker and the subsequent scenes tell the story of paulie  s constant struggle over many years to be re  united with his mistress . one of the many memorable scenes is when he falls into bad company and is encouraged to spy on people using the automatic teller machines . paulie it seems has a phenomenal memory .  br    br   the ending is predictable  but who would want it otherwise . children will love this film and anybody who keeps a bird as a pet will delight in paulie  s antics .  ,1
this is a quirky movie that the brits do so well . low budget  cameo type roles  well executed . the story is a little weak  a recently widowed judi dench decides to round up the  blonde bombshells  a all  well almost all  girl band who performed during the war in london . the obligatory son  daughter who thinks she  s gone potty . i did like the way the movie lets young people see that they don  t have a monopoly on feelings  love and even lust  that the  old wrinklies  can have a good laugh too . judi dench was superb as always  a pity we didn  t get to see more of the other  blonde bombeshells  the end was a little rushed i thought . i kept thinking as i watched that david jason would have made an even better patrick than ian holm  although he was quite adequate as the  transvestite  drummer . all in all a cheery movie well worth a night in with the girls    ,1
this is by far my favorite film of all time . that  s mainly because it  s not afraid to delve into some very politically incorrect topics  such as spanking and female submissiveness  that other mainstream films are just too timid to touch . nothing seems to be off  limits in this film as the director freely develops the story without any concern given to possibly offending the viewer . however  i don  t think anything was done here purely for shock value or to purposely offend anyone . sean young turns in an excellent and courageous performance . most established mainstream actresses would not have taken on this role or would have asked for some major script changes before accepting it . the other cast members do a fine job as well .  br    br   have you noticed that this movie hasn  t appeared on pay cable since an obligatory brief run a year after it hit the theaters  have you ever wondered why  the obvious reason is that it just doesn  t fit today  s political atmosphere . it seems quite ironic to me that some premium channels now carry softcore porn  that  s getting closer and closer to hardcore porn  but will not carry a mainstream movie like  love crimes  . sadly  even though this movie is only   years old  it could probably not be made today .  br    br    ,1
peter bogdonavich has made a handful of truly great films  and they all laughed is one of his best . the cast couldn  t be better equipped to play this light but slightly bittersweet screwball comedy . interestingly enough  the witty  light touch bogdonavich so effortlessly employs gives the film a rather disarming emotional core . fresh and immediate  the film starts with absolutely no explanation . there  s no soundtrack music to cue us . we meet the characters in action  and as bogdonavich glides down the streets of new york  the film unfolds effortlessly . robby muller  s camera captures it all with an understated simplicity that seems accidental  but surely isn  t . the cast is terrific . in every way  a classic .  ,1
i bought this movie last weekend at my local movie gallery . it was buy  get  free and i needed one more so i chose this one . horrible mistake . the box reads like it would be a really good movie . well  it starts out like it is going to be this great movie . for about  minutes  that is . the movie is about a young woman  laila  who gets killed trying to save her beau  jack  from a bull . laila  s dad  cordobes  is a rancher that the townspeople are afraid of . he assumes that jack killed laila because she was supposedly afraid of this bull  and goes on this hunt to find him . that was the first  minutes that is good . what follows after that is only gonna get    times worse . whoever wrote the script  in my opinion  had to of been on some kind acid trip or something because nothing else made any sense what so ever . jack is on the run and finds this traveling radio dj named mary who gives him a ride . i think mary is supposed to be a virgin mary type character . you know  jesus  mother . but  who knows  i couldn  t make heads or tails of it . as they  re running . . . we get to see bad guys  magical visions  ghostly encounters  flashbacks  etc . . . and all these things are done in such a way that your brain hurts from trying to figure out what  s going on . needless to say  i took the movie back and exchanged it for something else . it  s horrible i tell ya  horrible . and  there is absolutely no bull  fighting in this movie . unless you count the first minute of the movie . hope i helped some other people keep from wasting their time on this movie .  ,0
this will not likely be voted best comedy of the year  a few too many coincidences and plot holes . however we are talking about a movie where a hit  man and a white bread salesman become buddies so a few vagaries shouldn  t come as too much of a surprise . brosnan is excellent in this role  gone is the wooden james bond  a role he was wasted in  . if he can maintain this kind of quality i hope he continues to make comedies . greg kinnear is also excellent as brosnan  s straight man . i  ve read a few negative comments in here about hope davis but i thought she was quite good as a mousy housewife with a dark side buried deep within . there are lots of good chuckles as brosnan sleazes his way through and a few scenes where i nearly died laughing . my father  a consultant  nearly lost it when julian describes himself as a  facilitator  . much like  grosse pointe blank   another hit  man comedy  the humour can be very dark . if you are in to that be prepared to enjoy yourself .  ,1
the   year old virgin  is about andy stitzer  a forty year old man who works in an electronic store and doesn  t have much of a social life and is very awkward around women . some of his co  workers at the store invite him out one night and they discover that andy  is still a virgin so they plan to help him lose his virginity . one day in the store andy  meets a woman named trish  who gives him her phone number and eventually andy  works up enough courage to go on a date with her and they start to really like each other but andy  is still very awkward when it comes to sex and he is going to have to tell this to trish  much to his embarrassment if he can actually get up enough courage to tell her before things get awkward . the   year old virgin  has good direction  a good script  good comedic performances by the whole cast  good cinematography and good film editing . the film stars and is co  written by steve carell  who does a very good comedic breakthrough performance and his writing for the film is very good too . i was very pleasantly surprised with this film . it is sweet  funny  entertaining  fun  enjoyable  clever  good natured and a good time . this film is just as good as this year  s wedding crashers  and both films are two of the best comedies i have seen in awhile . the   year old virgin  really showcases a lot of talent and it is put to good use and it works as a comedy and a romance and it is sweet and a lot of fun . one of the biggest surprises and one of the best comedies of the year .  ,1
i enjoyed this movie . haven  t seen andy griffith in ages and felt he fit this role perfectly . i  ve associated him with comedy but am pleased to see that he  s versatile .  br    br   i wasn  t troubled that dotty  s  anxiety disorder  may not have been verbatim from a psychiatric textbook . there are zillions of whatever  phobias and neuroses  and these can take on a broad variety of quantitative and qualitative forms . she is clearly a sensitive with extra  sensory powers as was understood by the local indians but not by any anglos . it is not surprising that this character is vulnerable and nominally eccentric .  br    br   although this is taken to be a light  family movie   it is actually more sophisticated than it seems . also  hiram  s twist at the end came as a pleasant surprise to me and tied all the preceding action together in a bundle . it  s fun to contemplate the possibility of such spiritual guidance .  ,1
the best film about marriage and family . this is a very interesting reflections to the couples that will be come to the dangerous and paradoxical fascinating world of marriage and family . this decision could be the better or the worst in our lives and the life of our kids . the real intrusion or help of  friends   or executioner if we leave  . the real role of families they can help or they can destroy us . the mad priest who possibly is not much mad telling what could happen according the statistics and the reality . a couple who thinks in a  special  marriage  live a painful story in their future own history .  br    br   who likes contract marriage  nobody  after the priest tells their own history if they leave the future in another hands  if they don  t know what is the marriage . that the problems are true  that the life demand a real engage  guaranties  from each one . that the real victims of the divorce are kids  with real name andrea in the film  or names . that the abortion is only an easy exit sadness  regrets and unhappiness will be there after abortion . that the state and social security thinks every time less in a real problems of the families . the gossip of the  friends   the infidelity because of weakness and desperation of steffania because tomasso lives his life as if he were alone .  br    br   maybe someone could think that this film is a pessimistic film  but not . steffania and tomasso  in the deep of their hearts  they like a beautiful marriage and family  if not  why they like marriage  a truly and beautiful marriage depends only of the couple of each one of their decisions  of each one actions in their lives . the family could be a place where each one feel loved because being his or her  only by existing . the screenplay is wonderful . the performances are great steffania and tomasso  the almost cynical priest  an excellent direction and script . the colors and the management of the cameras  superb .  ,1
i just watched this film again and remain dismayed at the number of cynics who dismiss it as just new age pap . a great film  one that takes its time to develop  it keeps coming close to going over the edge but never does and ultimately is meditative  affecting  and truer to life than most films people who dismiss its  coincidences  can see . i was angry at the time that movies like  prince of tides  and  bugsy   though i liked the latter  were nominated for best picture that year  let alone that  silence of the lambs  won   and this was ignored completely except for one nomination for best screenplay . upon revisiting it  i think history supports my initial reaction   ,1
kubrick proved his brilliantness again  now in a suspense  horror film based on stephen king  s book titled the same way . jack torrance is a man in his forties  married  with one child  and with a past of trouble and alcoholism . the overlook hotel in colorado suspends service during the winter because of its extreme weather  and there is a well  paid job for the person who takes care of the facilities during those five months and torrance  who was looking to become a writer  found it perfect . but  the manager advised torrance about the loneliness in this place during the winter  potentially dangerous  and told him that some caretaker in the past went crazy and murdered his family . even before they got there  his son danny  who has some sort of imaginary friend who illuminates him the future  shinning   knew the place wasn  t good and didn  t want to go . once they installed themselves in the hotel  things started right but within a month  jack began acting strange  irritated  and depressed . at this point  we know something is going to happen  but don  t know when and how . scary things happen such as the appearance of two twin girls talking to danny  and someone who attacked him violently . they are not alone in this place . later on  jack started to see other people and immediately felt good with them  like if they were his family among them the famous psychotic caretaker  delbert grady . grady tells torrance that he must kill his family because they are  intruders  in the hotel . obeying this order  jack went for the objective and many of the most scary things i  ve ever seen happen here . the ending is spectacular and the viewers will stay interested and shocked until the last minute .  ,1
it  s easy to see how this below  average screenplay got by in the early sales  pitch meetings at regency films  and later with fox   cross the superhero genre with a comedic take on  fatal attraction  . . . voil  i don  t know how on earth a talented director like ivan reitman got involved  unless the pay was just too tempting . a dateless employee at an architectural design firm in n . y . c . meets a girl on the subway and asks her out despite the fact she  s distracted and unpleasant  he eventually gets her into bed   only to find out later she  s the big apple  s resident superhero  g  girl . this distaff superman  with powers bestowed upon her by a fallen meteorite  isn  t a fantasy heroine  however . . . screenwriter don payne has conceived her as a needy  possessive  vindictive bitch  he telegraphs this to us from miles away  though uma thurman still plays the role for sassy laughs  . this is the kind of worthless movie that can  t let an insult slip by . our introduction to leading man luke wilson  talking with rainn wilson on the train  is accompanied by a sour dig at gays  it prods at us to be assured these two buddies are strictly ladies  men  . after being approached by g  girl  s nemesis  who wants to zap her powers  wilson is told this will make her just an ordinary woman scorned . . . and isn  t that better after all  thurman  s early performances in films like  henry  june  and  jennifer   showcased an intelligent woman with angular grace and hypnotic poise her films with quentin tarantino helped expose her sinewy hardness and intensity  but that came at a price  the actress has seemingly lost her graceful touch  . the picture is exceedingly well  produced and shot  with expensive  seeming special effects  yet nobody bothered to find the humor in this scenario . it  s pushy  leering  ugly  and badly  cast . bloated  frozen  faced wilson can  t tell any of his co  workers that he  s dating g  girl because she made him swear he  d rather have a chainsaw stuck up his rectum . i wonder if writer payne actually thought that was hilarious . . . or  indeed  if anyone involved did   from   ,0
i can  t believe the likes of guillermo del toro and kim bassinger got involved ins this piece of garbage  the script is so poorly written and the directing so weak  both by the same person  that its hard to find more one  dimension characters in a film . the dialogs are so lame that this so called thriller got laughs out of the few fools that got into the theatre . the setup it  s tricky  inviting you to believe you are going to watch a chilling thriller and suddenly it turns out into the most stupid persecution film . bassinger  s character is so dumb  that she actually stops to scream to god  where are you   so the people after her can follow  and then takes a leak     and then she apparently got into the smallest wood in the world  i mean  she runs all over the place and the killers never loose track of her  and this happens in the middle of the night . it really makes me wonder  is that really the best writing people in hollywood can find that they spend millions producing it .  ,0
users who have rated this movie so highly simply can  t have seen enough good films to compare it with . have they all been brainwashed   i have rarely felt so disappointed by a film and some of that must be attributable to the ridiculous hype surrounding this movie .  br    br   from the first  bu is just a chase film . we pick it up at the end of one chase and go straight into another . and another . and another . and another . do you see a pattern emerging  there is virtually no time  wasted  on plot  character development  or boring old reality .  br    br   if you haven  t see the other two bourne films  you  re pretty lost . if you have  you only wish you were lost  somewhere a long way from a cinema .  br    br   paul greengrass  s dispassionate style worked exceptionally well on united   which was a sentiment overload desperate to happen  but on bourne and his interminable woes it just has the effect of removing the audience from involvement with the character . he runs . he jumps . he punches . he gets blown up . he clears tall buildings . yada yada yada . above all  he survives . he survives like a plastic action man survives  which only makes the ridiculous stunts he pulls all the more slack and lacking in any kind of tension . so he drives off a building  so what  he  ll survive . yawn .  br    br   there  s a girl thrown into the mix because bourne  s love interest died in a previous incarnation  but she  s just decor . i  ve seen more character depth and snappy dialogue in episodes of captain scarlet .  br    br   bourne  s own journey of literal self  discovery is dull and formless and tells us nothing we didn  t know from the first movie . he was turned into a killing machine . big deal . he finds out his true identity . so what  it doesn  t have any emotional resonance when it comes .  br    br   the  twist  ending is telegraphed and weak . oh  dear  the more i think about this film the more i hate it  i  ve already reduced my score to  during the writing of this comment  i  d better end now before the slide continues .  br    br   i love a good action flick and i love a good thriller . the bourne ultimatum is neither . it  s a loud  tedious series of flashy edits  ridiculous sound effects and cartoon violence .  br    br   the idea that it  shows the way  to the bond franchise is utter crap . casino royale blows it out of the water .  ,0
ok  the movie is good but i give it a  because the idea of a computer virus becoming an organic virus is pure fairy tale . this kind of crap just adds to those uncomputer savvy moron  s paranoid delusions that a computer virus is exactly like an organic virus . first of all  strings of code and dozens of  s and  s add up to computer virus . an organic virus is much more complex  even though it  s way tinier . though  it  s considered one of the simplest forms in the universe  organic virus  s attach burrow into your cells and attach themselves to the rna  then change your own rna code . explain to me how something like that could be processed from a monitor  maybe the radiation has some effect on the user  s cornea that turns your eyeballs into these viruses  i could see that  but obviously  the writer didn  t think of that .  ,0
rohmer strays from his usual portraits of french middle class to tell this costume drama about the difficulties of an aristocrat lady during the french revolution . what  s more attractive about  la anglaise . . .   apart from the story itself  is the fabulous aesthetics that rohmer has achieved . the images have been digitally decorated too make them look like baroque pictures . in some moments you can  t really say whether your watching a movie or a series of pictures in louvre musseum . every shot is like a piece of art .  br    br   my rate  .      br    br                    br    br                   br    br                br    br                       ,1
a pretty memorable movie of the animals  killing  people variety  specifically similar to  willard  in that it stars an aging character actor  in this case  a step down a bit to the level of les tremayne  who puts in the only distinguished performance i  ve seen him give  in a role as a man whose life is unbalanced and who subsequently decides to use his animal friends to exact revenge on those who have wronged him . yes  this is one of those movies where pretty much everybody is despicable  so that you will cheer when they die  and really the selection of actors  locations  etc . couldn  t be better at giving the film an atmosphere of shabby decadence .  br    br   tremayne  s character is  snakey bender   and he is certainly the most interesting thing about the movie an aged snake collector who is obsessed with john philip souza  s music . when the local preacher clamps down on his practice of collecting small animals from the local schoolchildren as bait for his snakes  and his friend gets married to a stripper  thus upsetting his ritual wednesday night band concert  he goes on the rampage  in the process creating a memorable pile  up of clunkers beneath the cliff where he dumps the wrecks after disposing of their unfortunate owners . one amusing game you can play while watching  snakes  is to place bets on which cars will land the farthest down the cliff .  br    br   all in all  very cheap and exploitative  but will really be a lot of fun for fans of these kinds of movies .  ,1
i  as a teenager really enjoyed this movie  mary kate and ashley worked great together and everyone seemed so at ease . i thought the movie plot was very good and hope everyone else enjoys it to  be sure and rent it   also they had some great soccer scenes for all those soccer players     ,1
holy cow  what a piece of sht this movie is . i didn  t how these filmmakers could take a    word book and turn it into a movie . i guess they didn  t know either  i don  t remember any farting or belching in the book  do you   br    br   they took this all times childrens classic  added some farting  belching and sexual inuindo  and prostituted it into a kaka joke . this should give you a good idea of what these hollywood producers think like . i have to say  visually it was interesting  but the brilliant visual story is ruined by toilet humor  if you even think that kind of thing is funny  i don  t want the kids that i know to think it is .  br    br   don  t take your kids to see  don  t rent the dvd . i hope the ghost of doctor suess ghost comes and haunts the people that made this movie .  ,0
why was this film made  even keeping in mind the generous tax concessions that australian film investors were given  there can be no reasonable explanation for this film being given the go  ahead . for goodness sakes  the actors cast in this film are aussie b  grade celebs  not actors  people like john michael  hollywood  howson  the original drummer from the band in hey hey its saturday  and the voice  over guy in countdown . but in saying that  this is still very watchable as long as you give it the brain attention it deserves  none . the script is bad  even for a self  confessed b  grade horror  and the acting and film quality is worse . it often looks as though it is a home movie  but even a home movie has  realism  . anyone interested in australian cinema  please  for the love of god  pretend this film was never made .  ,0
what we  ve got here is a situation . a man is found to be in distress and people want to help him   in contrasting ways . at the end they are forced to let it go . you can  t fix people . and though in various aspects reign over me is conventionally hollywood  that message isn  t .  br    br   this story is not about charlie fineman  adam sandler   a man who lost his wife and three daughters in a     plane who  s gone into a nearly psychotic state of ptss since . it  s about what meeting charlie does to alan johnson  don cheadle   a dentist in new york who was his roommate in dental school and  knowing about his tragedy  spots him on the street and reconnects . charlie is riding around on a little toy motorized scooter   a pretty fanciful contraption for negotiating manhattan traffic   with big headphones on over a mass of unruly hair . the hair is sandler  s chief prop to show he  s deranged . and the use of music as an escape must hit home to every ipod  wielding subway rider .  br    br   charlie is a disaster  but paradoxically alan  stuck with a controlling wife  jada pinkett smith   soon begins to envy him . charlie is living like an nutty adolescent boy with a huge trust fund  insurance money from the tragedy   and starts dragging alan off to  hang out    eat chinese   buy records  or watch a mel brooks marathon at a rep house . charlie lives in a nice big apartment protected by a mean landlady  redoing the kitchen over and over  collecting old vinyl of springsteen  the who  etc .  and playing a video game called shadow of the collosus on a giant screen in a big empty living room .  br    br   charlie  s in  laws are deeply concerned about him  but also somehow resentful  as we learn later . alan has a new patient who is propositioning him . charlie  s desperation makes us see alan  s . trying to help charlie partly permits alan to escape from his own stifling realities but partly just makes him more acutely aware of them .  br    br   cheadle and sandler make an odd couple  but that doesn  t matter  because it  s convincing that they might both need each other . charlie is desperate for the companionship of a friend who never knew his family  because to escape his loss  he is pretending he never had one . and so what if as a roommate charlie slept naked and sleep walked and had terrible musical taste  no motown   alan wants an escape from his tidy  emasculating life . he  s under the thumb not just of his wife but of his dental partners  who lord it over him though it  s he who set up the practice . they  re white  by the way  and he  s black .  br    br   there  s also the lascivious patient from hell  who seriously disrupts things at the dental offices  but starts looking different when charlie comes by and notices she  s a babe . his libido seems to be lurking ready to revive at any minute . he  s also drawn to the breasts of liv tyler  a psychotherapist in the same building as the dentists who starts trying to treat charlie when he admits he might need help .  br    br   sandler  s mad scenes are a little too theatrical  as are a lot of the plot devices  in fact this movie feels like a play at more than one point   but he has several monologues where he expresses his sorrow in ways that are deeply touching .  br    br   charlie  s not just delusional and sad  but dangerous and violent  and all these efforts to help him start to backfire . the movie is admirable in the way it conveys a sense that people can  t be made right . this is an interesting movie   sometimes a touching one   and it  s the first time     has been dealt with in terms of survivor suffering . but there is an element of comedy that seems tasteless at times  many of the people are too broadly drawn  and the overly grand hollywood interiors have dreadful dcor only the manhattan streets look real . there  s a courtroom scene that is preposterous  and donald sutherland is a judge who  s too good to be true . alan  s family problem is resolved too easily with a phone call . and yet this is worth watching for the acting   the control and subtlety of cheadle  and sandler in a serious role almost as good as the one he had in p . t . anderson  s     punch  drunk love  though that  s clearly a better movie  in fact a much better one .  ,1
ahista ahista is one little small brilliant . i started watching it  and at the beginning i got a little bored since the pacing was slow and the main idea of one guy meeting a girl who is lost was not really new . but as the film went on  i started getting increasingly and gradually engaged by the film  the fantastic writing and the charming romance . the film was extremely simple and natural and after some time i felt i was watching a real documentation of one guy  s life . there  s one very good reason the film got this feel  and it  s the fresh talent called abhay deol . he is extremely convincing as the simple  kind  hearted and struggling ankush  whose new love motivates him to make amends and fight for a better life . throughout the film  he is presented as an ordinary mischievous prankster  but also as a helping and loving person  who  like anyone else will do anything to protect his love . deol portrays all the different shades of his character  whether positive or negative  naturally and with complete ease .  br    br   shivam nair  s direction is very good . his depiction of the life of people in the rural neighbourhood is excellent  but what gets to be even more impressive is his portrayal of ankush  s relationships with the different people who surround him  including his friends and his love interest megha who he is ready to do anything for . i also immensely liked the way nair portrayed his interaction with his friend  s loud and plump mother whom he calls  khala   aunty  . he likes to drive her crazy and annoy her on every occasion  yet we see that she occupies a very special place in his heart and is like a mother  figure to him as evidenced in several scenes . except for abhay  the rest of the cast performed well . though soha ali khan did not stand out according to me  she was good and had some of her mother  s charm . the actors who played ankush  s friends were very good as was the actress who played ankush  s  khala  .  br    br   apart from the performances  the film  s writing was outstanding . the dialogues were sort of ordinary yet brilliant  and the script was also fantastic . that  s mainly because despite a not  so  new story it was never overdone or melodramatic and there were no attempts to make it look larger  than  life . the film  s biggest weakness was himesh reshammiya  s uninspiring music which was unsuitable for this film . otherwise  ahista ahista was a delightful watch and it got only better with every scene . the concept may not be new  but the film manages to look fresh and becomes increasingly heartwarming as the story goes by . the ending was bittersweet  kind of sad yet optimistic . in short  this movie really grows on you slowly  and this can be easily attributed to the wonderful writing  the moving moments  the charming romance  the realistic proceedings  and of course abhay deol  s memorable performance .  ,1
a featherweight plot and dubious characterizations don  t make any difference when a movie is as fun to watch as this one is . lively action and spectacular stunts  for their day  give this movie some real zip . and there  s some actual comedy from the ripping chemistry between the two leads . quinn makes a good villain also  although his role is completely overshadowed .  br    br   but don  t be fooled by maureen o  hara  s tough broad role  this is as sexist as any hollywood movie of this era . you might be able to forgive that because of the time in which it was made  but it  s still hard to get past . for all the heroism and gruesomely adult off  screen situations  this is still little more than an adolescent good time .  ,1
i loved this movie . it is a definite inspirational movie . it fills you with pride . this movie is worth the rental or worth buying . it should be in everyones home . best movie i have seen in a long time . it will make you mad because everyone is so mean to carl brashear  but in the end it gets better . it is a story of romance  drama  action  and plenty of funny lines to keep you tuned in . i love a lot of the quotes . i use them all the time . they help keep me on task of what i want to do . it shows that anyone can achieve their dreams  all they have to do is work for it . it is a long movie  but every time i watch it  i never notice that it is as long as it is . i get so engrossed in it  that it goes so quick . i love this movie . i watch it whenever i can .  ,1
this is a masterpiece footage in b  w   mm film . the film makes you see a strange way to begin the day at     am in a bar and how much things can happen there in  minutes .  br    br   the short amazingly  gets you in a complex story using very little elements  and step to step makes you realize that something isn  t totally right . it expresses a lot  makes your adrenalin go high with subtle details  and is incredibly understandable by anyone  not just the cinema critics experts .  br    br   but i know how it sounds  european short  black and white and low budgeted . don  t let that scare you . is really worth to see by anyone  not just experts in the genre .  br    br   isn  t really much more to tell  since the film just lasts  minutes  exactly   and i don  t want to spoil it . but i just watched it online and i couldn  t understand why no one spent a few minutes to post a comment about it .  br    br   really worth watching it .      .  ,1
this film is not deserved of the next few minutes i will spend criticizing it  but i know many people  like myself  rely on imdb . com to assist in deciding on films . for that reason alone  i am writing this .  br    br    live feed  is like an asian version of      s  the incredible torture show   aka  blood sucking freaks   http   www . imdb . com  title  tt         . torture  dismemberment  murder  cannibalism . . . sure  it  s all here along with a third  grade script  pathetic acting  and a perverted failure of an attempt at black comedy .  br    br   the film takes place in china  yet everyone speaks english . there is an abundance of girls in the film who are horrified by the butchering of dogs in a marketplace  yet are sexually excited about entering a porno parlor . one gal who is disgusted by the filth in a restroom stall moments later is still there having at it with her friends boyfriend  how he even got in there might be the only engaging thing about this whole film .  the film is absolutely awful  even for a b  movie . even if you were to download it for free  it would be an insult to your hard drive .  ,0
  i only wanted to see you laughing in the purple rain .  this is an excell film . it should have been re  rated to pg    . but anyways  prince  s first film and greatest . the follow  up sucked . but i haven  t seen for years so here  s what i can remember about it . the kid  prince  has to juggle with winning over the love of his life  apollonia  herself   keeping his band together  the revolution as themselves  and the tension in his family . but his rival band  the time as themselves  is ruining his life . like morris  himself  is trying to steal apollonia from the kid . just like saturday night fever  flashdance and  mile . really good . rent it  laugh and cry and if you luv it  buy it .  ,1
this movie was fantastic great movie all through scary as hell . and i mean it freaked me out as much as pulse and it and the omen etc . but with a great movie comes a crap ending right  right  this movies ending was pathetic stuff . i mean a ghost turned back time in a chicks house and it thinks now i have done that it means i can call her and itll be the right time cause she thinks it is . right  wrong . my ass  i don  t care if the ghost is satan  it just doesn  t happen . its a movie yes but most evil movies or praised movies like this are meant to make sense but it didn  t . it just showed us what i just said and people don  t think anything of it . can someone please tell me why you all haven  t noticed that pathetic part . the movie for me ended in the hospital and that is all . check out number  its much more kick ass  ,0
i came to nancy drew expecting the worst . . . because of everyone else  s bad reviews . i thought even though i don  t read the books  that doesn  t look anything like the nancy drew i  ve heard of . but i was wrong . sure  it wasn  t a carbon copy of the books  but when you make a movie out of something  you have to modify it to become big  screen entertainment . the plot was enjoyable and thrilling with a lot of actual scares and i thought that emma roberts was really believable in her own way of portraying this classic character . there were several funny moments and on the contrary of many statements  at no point in this film does nancy come off as a ditz . she was intelligent  conservative  polite and genuine . one thing this movie also did well was balance the whole thing out with a mix of comedy  romance  suspense and heartfelt moments . i loved this movie . what a flick  what a flick  and if you are wise and decide to trust me and go see this  be prepared for some scary as heck moments because i was  like  freaking out  go see it or be a bum  bum and just let other people decide what you think of this movie for you . . . a mistake i almost made . i love it  i wanna own this movie  i love emma roberts now  too . she  s like a mini  bree van de kamp from dh . love it  love it .  ,1
after an initial release of  very good eurotrash titles  redemption has managed to scrape the bottom of the barrel with the bloodsucker leads the dance . i found no bloodsuckers anywhere in this movie .  br    br   the story is simple . a mysterious count invites several actresses to his castle for a little vacation . after some sofcore sexual shenanigans the girls get decapitated one by one . who is the killer  who knows  there are more red herrings in this one than at the local fish market on friday .  br    br   the pace is excruciating . the story is silly and the skin scenes aren  t all that terrific either .  br    br   give this one a miss .  ,0
a very unique sci  fi animated film  and frankly i love uniqueness no matter which way it tends to be  better or worse . this french film is quite interesting to watch  the technique part is innovatory  like  waking life  i recently watched .  br    br   it took me quite a long time to get used to the black  white style  but eventually i love it  the sketchlike images are really fancy  the contracted future world is a symbol of human race  s final destination which i adore it very much .  br    br   the whole plot is fine for a sci  fi  not so intriguing but it  s ok  like some hollywood  s products  a giant conspiracy about human  s eternity  a little bit clich and the twisted ending is not so convincing  some development is just too plain and insipid  and the whole movie is too long .  br    br   so i think i  m just in love with the style this film shows  others are not so good .  br    br   about the eternity of life  i think most people have come to a unanimousness that we don  t want eternity because it demolishes the meaning of life  we treasure our lives because they are limited and meaningful  if everyone can live forever  thus the world world will become a disaster and chaos . leaving someone you love is hard and heartbreaking  but that  s also a way to show our lives are genuine and all the emotion fulfills one  s life and make the world colorful and lively .  ,1
at the end of the film i just asked myself   is it the worse movie i have ever seen or is it the worse movie i have ever seen   . and the answer is . . . actually  after having seen this movie and thought a bit about the meaning of it  you just can  t find any meaning and you can only remember the two rape scenes  which are unbelievably brutal and useless . it seems to me as if the director tried to push this question into the crowd  s head   what are such crimes compared to horror of war and extermination   because i noticed that the two awful scenes where directly connected to war and it  s horrors  during the first scene you can here the girl that is being raped screaming and in the same time you hear one of president bush  s speeches about the necessity of starting a war with iraq and in the second scene  the pictures of the three criminals sticking a sword in a woman  s vagina  are directly followed by archive pictures of world war ii . but as a matter of facts  i really could not think about the relative gravity of theses two different kinds of human horror  s expression  being done i was too shocked by what i had just seen and felt .  sorry for bad english   ,0
in      with the success of the first season of batman the animated series  warner brothers commissioned the team responsible for the hit  show with producing a feature  length movie  originally slated for direct  to  video  but bumped up to theatrical status . it would become known as batman mask of the phantasm . ten years after phantasm  we have had an additional three feature  films released from the boys at the wb  sub  zero  return of the joker  and now  mystery of the batwoman joins the family .  br    br   the plot is basic and in many ways similar to mask of the phantasm a new female vigilante modeling herself after batman has begun targeting operations run by gotham mob boss rupert thorne and oswald cobblepot aka the penguin . now  batman must attempt to unravel the mystery of the batwoman before she crosses the line .  br    br   the animation is the sleeker  futuristic style that was utilized for batman the animated series  fifth and sixth seasons  aka the new batman adventures  .  it  s quite nicely done  and just as sleek as return of the joker  s animation . there is also some use of cgi  but it  s minor compared to the overabundance of it in sub  zero . the music was alright . different and exotic and similar to the justice league score  although the points in the score when the old animated batman theme comes up will be sure to send waves of nostalgia through the older fans  rodent  shaped hearts .  br    br   kevin conroy  as always  does a wonderful job as bruce wayne and batman . it  s also great to have the old batman the animated series alumni back that includes bob hastings  commissioner gordon   robert costanzo  detective bullock   tara strong  barbara gordon  batgirl her cameo hints at the romantic  relationship between her and bruce that was mentioned in batman beyond   and efrem zimbalist jr .  alfred  .  br    br   villains were also great  especially given that rupert thorne  the old mob boss from the original series  appears for the first time since the fourth season .  br    br   overall  while not quite reaching the standard set by mask of the phantasm ten years ago  motb carries on the torch quite nicely for the animated batman films . and if you have the dvd and are a hardcore fan  you will love the five  minute short chase me .  ,1
i had just watched one episode of this program and i couldn  t even get to the end of the program . every minute i had watched this program my i . q must of dropped about   points . this is basically like a children  s program but with swearing . not even the swearing and the insults she tells other people made me laugh . anyways the story must of been written by a monkey and the people who actually put this script for this program through for filming must of been held at gun point and had no choice but to film this retarded  disappointing  horribly acted program . sarah silvermann should use the little money she actually made from this program and get some god damn acting lessons .  ,0
simon  s carefully written dialogues are truly electrified by matthau and burns . you can literally hear the script crackle . there are few movies out there that can develop such a relationship between the actors and the script . for example  the famed reunion scene could have been a lot duller with less  quality actors involved . matthau seems to had been born to play willie clark  of course  oscar moreso in the odd couple   and with all of the little idiosyncracies and mannerisms that matthau crams into the character  the line where he is arguing that he is with it since he lives in the city whereas lewis lives in the country that lewis is  out of touch  is the quintessential example of this  make this one of the best performances i  ve ever seen of any actor in any role  be it comedic or drama or whatever else . period . matthau and burns work excellently together the contrast they portray accentuates simon  s superb knack at creating comedic conflict . this movie is simply one of the ultimate  must  sees  and does demand a rightful prestigious place in the pages of film history .  ,1
a serial killer dies in a snowstorm and gets mutated into frosty the snowman  s evil twin . then goes on a killing spree . interesting plot . sounds scary . and it is scary . if you  re five years old . otherwise  it  s kind of cheesy . i saw it on cable and i  m glad i didn  t pay money to see it . it has all the charm and style of a low  budget movie which may become a cult film . i  m sure it has a loyal fan base somewhere . i  m just not in it . even though i didn  t like the movie as a whole  there were some scenes i found amusing . such as the bathtub scene and the post  explosion scene with the picasso reference . it was also enjoyable to watch the many ways the heroes try to kill jack and he just doesn  t seem to want to die . in short   jack frost  is a good low  budget b  movie comedy  but a bad low  budget b  movie horror .  ,0
i  ve seen many horror shows over the years  like nightstalker  that dealt with the wendigo legend  so i was looking forward to an angry spirit causing mayhem to add flavor to the halloween season . man was i mistaken . the whole movie creates this sense of events about to happen that will be scary and creepy  but then delivers a very simplistic tale of revenge and murder over the loss of some property . ve  ery scary  not  this movie has a lot in common with cold creek manor  another total loser .  br    br   it  s getting harder and harder to believe anything hollywood puts forward about scary movies  since they rarely come through with anything original and spooky anymore . what idiots pay for such a bogus movie to be made  go back to the drawing board fellas  and do something useful with those millions of greenbacks you have to throw around .  ,0
i usually steer clear of tv movies because of the many ways you know that it  s tv movies five seconds into the picture . this one got my attention because of the unusual title and its gloomy  well  crafted mood that is established from the very start . while the ever present rain confirmed my suspicions of a misplaced story  even if claiming to be set in california the movie was largely shot around a stormy vancouver  b . c .   the dark and oppressive outdoors beautifully complement olmos  excellent acting .  ,1
title robot jox        br    br   director stuart gordon  br    br   cast gary graham  anne marie johnson  paul koslo  br    br   review stuart gordon who we usually associate with extremely gory horror films such as re  animator  from beyond  dagon and castle freak  took a small detour here and did a little sci  fi flick . i stress the word  little  since this is a very low budget flick  and there in lies its main weakness .  br    br   the story takes place in the future . a world in which the great superpowers  that according to this movie are the united states and russia  duke out their differences not by going on a full blown world war . . . but by fighting gladiator style battles with gigantic robots . our hero achilles must go up against the evil russian robot fighter called alexander . lots of cheap stop motion animation ensues .  br    br   well  the idea is awesome i guess . the great nations settleling territorial disputes with giant robots  interesting premise and one that could have been handled properly if the proper budget had been available . unfortunately what could have been a fun movie ends up being an embarrassment for an otherwise great director .  br    br   i as a kid loved this movie  and i guess if you want any enjoyment out of this movie  you  ll have to revert back to little kid mode to have some fun with it . i showed this film to some of my friends and as the movie progressed my friends where like  what the hell is this piece of crap franco   and i  m like well this movie is a sci  fi by one of my favorite directors stuart gordon   but as the movie progressed into corny territory i almost felt like pressing stop and not having them go through that torture . i could go through it  cause i loved this film as a kid  and there  s still a little nostalgia attached to watching it . but everyone else was just not going to get it .  br    br   and i myself realized that the movie isn  t really that good . first off . the movie is about giant robots kicking the hell out of each other . and in order to achieve this in a credible fashion you  d have to use some damn good special effects to make it work  expensive effects that would help us the audience suspend disbelief . but unfortunately this being a small scale movie  from a small scale company  empire pictures  which went bankrupt after making this film   the effects only help us giggle and laugh at them . heck even the sets and some of the wardrobe looks unfinished or half assed .  br    br   ok granted  once you accept that you are watching a mixture of moderate stop animation and miniatures well you can sort of give in to the film and even enjoy the big robots kicking the hell out of each other . there are certain scenes when the robots are fighting that are kinda cool  and made me go  thats why i liked thid movie   but every know and them  some crappy effect will take you right out of that protective little cocoon you were trying to hide in . and boom  your right back into realizing this film just doesn  t live up to its premise .  br    br   and heres another thing that sort of bothered me a bit about the movie . this movie is basically a movie for kids . you know  giant robots duking it out  stop motion animation  hello  but this movies dialogue had a lot of sexual innuendos and the violence gets a little bloody . so i kept asking myself is this a kids movie or not  after a while i just came to the conclusion that basically this was a kids movie with adult sensibilities  which really isn  t a good mix .  br    br   so for those of you who don  t feel that certain naive childlike charm of watching two robots fighting each other and if you don  t have a nostalgic connection to this movie  like i do  well id suggest you steer clear away from this one . gordons a great director  but this movie he made  just didn  t do it for me . well  at least not now that i  m a full grown adult .  br    br   rating  out of   ,0
this movie  joshua  is extremely disturbing  and downright pointless . it actually makes me shudder to think there are people who would enjoy watching it . without giving away the story it is about a young boy  s reaction to his newborn sister  and that is just the tip of the iceberg . during the entirety of this movie the viewer is subjected to some of the most unsettling child behavior imaginable . adding insult to injury  by the end of this movie there is absolutely no real outcome except the fruition of pure evil at the hands of a child no less  who outsmarted a whole group of dumb adults . there is no redemption  no justice served  and a whole group of adults who are not smart enough to see what is going on around them . frankly  i did not enjoy watching this movie . it was extremely unsettling . even for those who might enjoy horror movies  this movie could be too much . despite the fact this movie was well acted  the story itself is so disturbing that watching it was equivalent to a   minute wait in a dentist  s waiting room in anticipation of some painful dental procedure .  ,0
ice age is not only animation of the year  in my eyes  it  s also the best animated feature i  ve ever seen   br    br   the teaser excited me last year and i  ve spent many happy hours on the website . scrat is cool  and so are the rest of the sub zero heroes .  br    br   the animation is superb . your heart really goes out to the characters in this film . they have good lines of dialogue and are well developed . it  s hard to say which one really steals the picture .  br    br   i experienced their journey with laughter  tears and amazement . nothing was forced or over done . the emotion was genuine  especially in the dramatic second half . the last film to affect me this deeply was anastasia in      also a fox production . and before that it was the land before time     . all possess real charm and seek to entertain all the audience  not just the cynics .       br    br    ,1

i went to see antone fisher not knowing what to expect and was most pleasantly surprised . the acting job by derek luke was outstanding and the story line was excellent . of course denzel washington did his usual fine job of acting as well as directing . it makes you realized that people with mental problems can be helped and this movie is a perfect example of this . don  t miss this one .  ,1

this esteemed production has it  s fans . but to paraphrase the classic bad review of  mary reilly   moby dick is like a painting  only slower .  br    br   this is because the philosophical grounds for a movie  production  are never to make a great film  rather it  s to substitute the lack of a strong guiding idea  in this case for a books transference to film  with a list of hopelessly atomized  undynamic but dazzling conceits in an effort to trick viewers into thinking they  ve seen greatness . as viewers  critics are apt to fall for this  oscars follow  feeding the whole dumb equation .  br    br   i don  t share in the pleasure all these reviewers found . moby dick is stunningly uninvolving . actors dutifully recite essays about jonah  moby dick  the ocean  moby dick  moby dick . . . all things that can  t respond  and not one of which is absorbing in the slightest . it  s dramatically inert . it doesn  t build . in narrative terms moby dick  as a movie  is little more than a foregone conclusion in search of an actual story . after half an hour i was muttering  oh terrific . . . another oath . . . another  minute soliloquy    br    br   in the failed effort to involve you  it  s a pretty campy overacting showcase . a lot of grey hair here . starbuck is supposed to be a golden god .     br    br   one knows one is looking at a great director when he makes the medium his own rather than trying to replicate the feel of someone else  s paintings  palette  or reverently embalming a classic as huston does here . paintings and books are nice but they  re a different mediums . a movie like this fails to grasp that an honestly enjoyable piece of crap  village of the damned  is better in most respects than an insufferable piece of culture . this is the eat your vegetables school of film  making .  br    br   one appreciates the work that must have been done to make the movie  but not the narrative . only a few segments reflecting maritime research are interesting the recording of shanties as a means of structuring work  various sea efforts and the technology of whaling . and that doesn  t call for a two  plus hour movie .  ,0
if you can believe it  another group of teens return to another lakeside cabin three years after another one of those fatal  accidents  claimed one of their number . low and behold  a psycho wearing a patterned hockey mask  a cheap papery one at that  turns up to waste them one by one . this mechanical  friday the   th  knock off gained slight notoriety as one of the first digitally  shot features  but that  s where the interesting facts end and all that remains is a predictable  amateur production with sub  par performances and a recurring boom  mic intrusion . a last  second twist does little to lift the spirits  and  memorial day  is something best tossed in a lake and forgotten about . one for insane slasher collectors only .  ,0
i  m always suprised on how different all people are and how for almost every movie you get both extremes . people who think it  s the best movie and people who think it  s the worst .  br    br   stigmata wouldn  t be the worst movie i  ve ever seen  but it  s up there . first of all the sound . the producers spent more time on the soundtrack than the editing . it was so loud when the soundtrack was playing and no one was talking and then when patrica was talking in her monotone voice  she could hardly be heard .  br    br   i usually like patrica and gaberial  but they were both flat in this movie . patrica had basically  emotions . quiet  in great pain  or really angry she has stigmata . the first was the predominate one  the second involved screaming pain  the third involving raising her voice . it was loudness that distiguished the three and not emotion .  br    br   maybe i missed a lot of the deep meaning and subplots everyone was talking about  or maybe i was distracted by the terrible filming and mtv like style . when you watch a  minute video you need fast cuts and slow motion to convey a quick story  in a  hour feature film  it  s nauseating . i fail to see the meaning of her seeing that women across the steet and dropping a child . and no pittsburg does not rain that often    br    br   i think maybe a real story  with something to say could have been intended  but all the budget was spent on buying music and the equipment to do slow rain drop shots and renting that gorgous apartment that ms . arquett lived in that they ended up firing the guy with the story .  ,0
my original review of this film was simply the word sht written     times over . although this was a very accurate critique  i felt my review should be a little more descriptive .  br    br   i will start with the lead actress her facial expression doesn  t change once in this film  she doesn  t show fear  happiness or depression . her skills in body language pretty much come down to darting her eyes left and right and looking like she don  t know jack . she is an emotionless husk who i  m guessing has had too much botox . her lack of facial expression through out the film is outmatched however by the deplorable love affair with the lead actor which seems to spring out of nowhere and has them making out on a beach and falling in love within a couple of hours of meeting one another . the lead actor  whose hair demands more attention than he did  was mediocre at best and did not once make me feel like he was genuinely in peril .  br    br   the only thing that tops the hideous acting is the directing  storyline and inaccuracies in plot . i have seen tampon ads with more structure than this movie . the is no development in character  they just seem to say and do things that i could never believe a real person would .  br    br   this film would not have been bad if it was trying to be crap on purpose like snakes on a plane but it was trying so hard to be a serious action flick that i couldn  t even laugh . i believe i now have a brain tumour from watching this film and thinking up all the different ways i could have used that budget and cg team to create something far superior . if i bought this on dvd i would smash the dvd to pieces  burn it then dissolve it in hydrochloric acid for good measure . don  t watch this film   ,0
this horror movie is really weak . . . that is if this is the correct movie i am commenting on . nothing really terrible goes on as a family adopts a cute little german shepard pup . i had a german shepard and it is a really good dog . i did not get the idea to get one from this movie though  but rather from the comedy  k    . that is another story all together though . this movie really doesn  t have much horror at all as the most horrific scene is at the end and it looks really cheesy . also  we see a guy almost put his hand into a lawn mower . that is about it . the father suspects something though  as his family seems to be getting rather strange  somewhere he finds out if you hold a mirror to them while they are sleeping you can see if they are possessed . all in all a really weak horror movie even by television standards . . . television movies that do work are out there as  this house possessed  is pretty good and there is another haunted house movie about a woman and these strange creatures that is also rather good . this one is really rather dull .  ,0
hundstage is an intentionally ugly and unnerving study of life in a particularly dreary suburb of vienna . it comes from former documentary director ulrich seidl who adopts a very documentary  like approach to the material . however  the film veers away from normal types and presents us with characters that are best described as  extremes   some are extremely lonely some extremely violent some extremely weird some extremely devious some extremely frustrated and misunderstood and so on . the film combines several near plot less episodes which intertwine from time to time  each following the characters over a couple of days during a sweltering viennese summer . very few viewers will come away from the film feeling entertained  the intention is to point up the many things that are wrong with people  the many ills that plague our society in general . it is a thought  provoking film and its conclusions are pretty damning on the whole .  br    br   a fussy old widower fantasises about his elderly cleaning lady and wants her to perform a striptease for him while wearing his deceased wife  s clothes . a nightclub dancer contends with the perpetually jealous and violent behaviour of her boy  racer boyfriend . a couple grieving over their dead daughter can no longer communicate with each other and seek solace by having sex with other people . an abusive man mistreats his woman but she forgives him time and again . a security salesman desperately tries to find the culprit behind some vandalism on a work site but ends up picking on an innocent scapegoat . and a mentally ill woman keeps hitching rides with strangers and insulting them until they throw her out of the car  the lives of these disparate characters converge over several days during an intense summer heat wave .  br    br   the despair in the film is palpable . many scenes are characterised by long  awkward silences that are twice as effective as a whole passage of dialogue might be . then there are other scenes during which the dialogue and on  screen events leave you reeling . in particular  a scene during which the security salesman leaves the female hitch  hiker to the mercy of a vengeful guy  to be beaten  raped and humiliated  thankfully all off  screen  for some vandalism she didn  t even do  arouses a sour  almost angry taste . in another scene a man has a lit candle wedged in his rear  end and is forced to sing the national anthem at gunpoint  all as part of his punishment for being nasty to his wife . while we might want to cheer that this thug is receiving his come  uppance  we are simultaneously left appalled and unnerved by the nature of his punishment . indeed  such stark contrasts could act as a summary of the whole film  every moment of light  heartedness is counter  balanced with a moment of coldness . every shred of hope is countered with a sense of despair . for every character you could like or feel sympathy for  there is another that encourages nothing but anger and hate . we might want to turn away from hundstage  to dismiss it as an exercise in misery  but it also points up some uncomfortable truths and for that it should be applauded .  ,1
broad enough for you  wait till you see this heavy handed  br    br   adaption of a little collegiate one act . what is shocking and wild in  br    br   college rarely holds up over time  and this is proof . to take on the  br    br   catholic church with broadside humor just isn  t shocking or  br    br   interesting or funny  it  s kind of boring . the performers are all  br    br   game  giving all they  ve got  but it  s basically a play that doesn  t  br    br   open up to film well . not a lot of fun .  ,0
i see a lot of folks on this site wishing ag would come out on dvd . well  i bought it on dvd .  from borders  no less   while it is great to have this terrific show in a boxed dvd form  i am upset by the fact that they added very few in the way of  extra  s   a director commentary from shaun cassidy on the pilot episode  and the episodes are shown in the same order they were put out on tv . the missing episodes that were never shown prior to being run on sci fi channel are in the box set  but are tacked on the final dvd . if you buy the dvd set  get the actual order they are to be viewed and you will be happier .  you will need to swap dvd  s in and out of your player to see them in order  but you will be glad you did .   br    br   s  ,1
i had the pleasure of seeing this film at the rhode island international film festival and was very impressed . tess nanavati is clearly a great screenwriter and i would love to see more of her films . if she could do what she did with the budget of this film  i  m very anxious to see what she can do with a major picture . kudos to the cast for their terrific performances  that little girl was gold   and to whoever composed the music . the warped  row your boat  blew me away . very creative film all around . . . . i really hope to see it come out on video or dvd because i  d buy it in a second . if you get the chance  you should definitely see this film .  ,1
a pretty obvious thriller  by  numbers  in which the only possible twist turns out to be a hiding to nothing . i was watching principally for the english  language performance by isabelle huppert . it wasn  t great  but then it was a strange role . i wouldn  t be surprised if half her contribution turned out to have been left on the cutting  room floor along with several last minute script re  writes .  br    br   the acting is the least appealing thing about this film . steve guttenburg looks like he  s trying to flesh out his role with the charm that everyone  s told him he has . there  s a sensationally stupid sequence in which it  s suggested that his sexual prowess will be able to help treat ptsd . it  s an uninteresting performance . elizabeth mcgovern is more of a draw with genuine charm and character but it  s small consolation .      ,0
a beautiful shopgirl in london is swept off her feet by a millionaire tea plantation owner and soon finds herself married and living with him at his villa in british ceylon . although based upon the book by robert standish  this initial set  up is highly reminiscent of hitchock  s  rebecca   with leading lady elizabeth taylor clashing with the imposing chief of staff at the mansion and  almost immediately  her own husband  who is still under the thumb of his deceased  but  dominant father . taylor  a last  minute substitute for an ailing vivien leigh  looks creamy  smooth in her high fashion wardrobe  and her performance is quite strong however  once husband peter finch starts drinking heavily and barking orders at her  one might think her dedication to him rather masochistic  this feeling hampers the ending as well  . still  the film offers a heady lot for soap buffs romantic drama  a bit of travelogue  interpretive dance  an elephant stampede  and a perfectly  timed outbreak of cholera   from   ,1
deathtrap is not a whodunit . it  s a who gonna do it to who first . it  s so hard to describe this movie without giving anything away so i won  t mention anything more about the plot . as far as acting goes it is cris reeves greatest role as clifford  a young playwrite . you really see the range in his acting abilities in this movie from  exhaling cheeseburgers  to downright frightening . clifford is such a hard role to play and in the stage production of this i have never seen clifford played well on both ends of the spectrum . the actor plays him as a little puppy or a homicidal maniac . reeves is the only person i have seen who has the character right all the way through . as for michael caine he  s . . . . . well he  s michael caine . one of the best actors of the last   years and in this film as good as he has ever been .  ,1
i am oh soooo glad i have not spent money to go to the cinema on it    . it is nothing more than compilation of elements of few other classic titles like the thing  final fantasy  the abyss etc . framed in rather dull and meaningless scenario . i really can not figure out what was the purpose of creating this movie  it has absolutely nothing new to offer in its storyline which additionally is also senseless . moreover there is nothing to watch  the fx  es look like there were taken from a second hand store  you generally saw all of them in other movies . but it is definitely a good lullaby .  ,0
this film was slow but tedious and the acting often drifted into the land of ham . redgrave  s character was unappealing as the   something woman trying to compete with thurman  s   something for the love of fox  s character  why is beyond me  . the title of the movie should have been  shallow people on the lake  . the actors played like they were in a rehearsal . a dreadfully predictable ending to boot . i can  t believe this is on this website as a comedy   ,0
i enjoyed the innocence of this film and how the characters had to deal with the reality of having a powerful animal in their midst . the gorilla looks just terrific  and the eyes were especially lifelike . it  s even a little scary at times and should have children slightly frightened without going over the top . rene russo plays her role wonderfully feminine . usually these type of hollywood films that take place in the past feel the need to create a straw  man villain but the only adversary is the gorilla . it  s an interesting look at how close some animals are to humans  how they feel the same emotions we do  and yet how we really can  t treat them just like people because they aren  t . not many films venture into this territory and it  s worth seeing if you want to contemplate the human  animal similarity .  ,1
about the worst movie in distribution right now  i love zombie movies and saw this in the used rack so i thought why not  oh my god a shame to zombie movies and fans to the genre  whoever made this movie needs to put away your camcorder and go to film school  there are so many gore hounds out there who have put time and effort into their films and they have something that this film doesn  t dignity . i know it what it takes to make films and i  m sure there was a lot of money and time spent in making meat market but none of that money and time went in to making it good . you need actors  a script  a real camera  invest in some books on how to make independent films . i don  t know how you got a dvd release but whoever did that is either a really good friend or banging their head on the wall . in gore films it is quality not quantity  the effects are weak  i was so angry that this is actually in stores and that i couldn  t get my money back . please if you have seen this film write here and put an end to shlock . i know i  m being very harsh  i only had   lines so i  m trying to get to the point .  ,0

i suppose bad laurel and hardy is better than no laurel and hardy at all  but just barely . it  s sad that the fox films are the ones getting a big release on dvd  exposing people who may not be too familiar with lh to their worst stuff rather than their classic comedies .  br    br   once again the boys are saddled with a dumb romantic plot about a guy who  s invented an invisible ray . he  s in love with the bosses  daughter  who hates him and prefers some slick guy . it  s incredible to think the geniuses at fox thought this is what lh needed in their films .  br    br   without their pancake makeup the boys look tired and old . the only scenes that work for them in this picture is when they try to sneak out of a bedroom window at night and the rather bizarre scene where robert mitchum  being a classic noir bad guy tries to sell oliver hardy  insurance  on stan .  br    br   otherwise  this script is just a mess . forget this and see if you can find a copy of  a chump at oxford  or  bohemian girl  or  sons of the desert  instead .  ,0
in fact  these young people were so distasteful that i couldn  t wait for all of  em to get slaughtered  and that includes clarissa  joanna canton  since i considered her the most annoying of the bunch .  br    br   but i knew it was gonna be a mess from the opening minutes when a teen christine opened fired on the priest and the nuns with the leslie gore music playing in the background . it had nowhere to go but down .  br    br   even the prosthetics looked fake and the  blood  looked suspiciously like hawaiian punch  although later on it took on red day  glo look to match the silly halloween makeup they were all wearing . i  m sure all the goth morons out there will appreciate this bullsh  t since it  ll appeal to that bunch . it sure didn  t appeal to me . blah . . .  br    br   and not even my favorite horror babe adrienne barbeau can save this stupid teen horror flick from itself . she still looks hot  though . i  m glad she takes care of herself since we don  t get to see too much of her nowadays .  br    br   however  it is a step up from dante tomaselli  s meandering horror       in that it has a somewhat coherent plot  so i  ll give it that much . that and the little boston terrier named boozer also brings it up a notch . i like what boozer does to clarissa in the end . it was the only good scene in an otherwise silly film .  br    br   lion  s gate films sure must have been desperate when they picked this one up .  br    br    out of    ,0
there are two things that i like about elvira  and they  re both bigger than she is and she keeps them covered up her wit and her talent . a movie is the best thing to show off how funny she can be or how she commands attention . looking like a combined clone of morticia adams and anna nicole smith  she inherits a distant relative  s estate only to discover that she is really the heiress of the occult . the comedy in this movie is the best thing about it  but it could have been a lot more scary and chilling . it  s mostly a campy fare with as many bad horror movie references in it such as the rioting mob or the fleeing heroine who trips and stumbles on her heels . my favorite part is when she uses her marvelous endowments to break the chains keeping her locked in the cemetary . the ending is sappingly sweet as if it were written by the bradys  but the las vegas act at the end seems too grandiose for this type of movie .  ,1
prisons are not exactly renowned for their kind hospitality and  happy vibes   what with stories of fights  chaos  murder and of course extreme male bonding  but the prison in this film is a different beast altogether . horror films set in cells are  as you probably know  nothing particularly new as they emphasis and exaggerate the fear of claustrophobia and the inability of escape  two of the greatest themes in horror cinema . with such examples as the chair  waldermar korzeniowsky        the green mile  frank darabont        alien   david fincher       and of course the entire women in prison exploitation genre itself  another entry into this niche has to be something inventive and a lot of fun to boot in order to be recognised . or at least that  s what you  d have thought . prison is certainly an incredibly fun and enjoyable ride and it  s somewhat of a shame that it isn  t as well known as it should be .  br    br   the film  in short  centres on an old prison  well  duh   which has been reopened . however  it  s not just fellow inmates and guards the prisoners have to fear  but also a mean ass demon ghost spirit with only one thing on its mind death  and boy  are we treated to some awesome death scenes  i won  t spoil anything here for you but there are plenty of innovative and enjoyable murders all done by invisible hands .  br    br   besides the special effects and the murders  this film also has another thing going for it it  s cast . headlining  we have lord of the rings  peter jackson            star viggo mortensen  and for all those so inclined  yes  he does get naked  whose performance is not only highly believable  but is done with such skill that his eastwood  esquire character is both bad  to  the  bone and likable  a very delicate mix  . add him to a cast of  hey  wait  a  minute  i  know  that  guy  actors and you  ve got yourself one great set of stars . the characters themselves however lack three  dimensionality and more often than not come across as very stereotypical . we  ve got a black oculist  a hard  as  nails prison warden  a human  rights activist woman and plenty of other stock characters . but in all honesty  this  fault  actually aids the film . instead of boring character development in an over  long equilibrium  we are chucked  more or less  straight into the action and once it gets going  very early on  there  s not a single scene that  s a filler  it  s balls to the wall plot . unlike a certain shawshank redemption  frank darabont        sharing conventions with the slasher genre  this is somewhat of a convention itself  and  in good ol  slasher genre tradition  prison punishes those who have been bad .  br    br   all in all this is an excellent little horror film and one which is sadly overlooked and unmentioned among the horror world . with an excellent cast and great special effects and rather original death scenes this film is highly recommended to horror fans . don  t be fooled into thinking it  ll be a cheesy little film either  just because it was made in usa     s  it  s far from cheesy  although the very end does ruin this  and  simultaneously  far from gritty and realistic  whilst it attempts to tackle issues such as prison rape  these are rather subtly done  .  br    br   i give it  .  out of  luvs . a very entertaining horror film with some very nice touches indeed .  ,1
the priyadarshan  paresh rawal combo has been golden before with the likes of hera pheri and hungama so i went into the movie  at an indian multiplex  with high hopes  especially after the slick promos . unfortunately  like hulchul before it  this movie was a huge disappointment .  br    br   like others have commented  the premise of the movie  which was already stale to begin with  just gets stretched on and on without any development or additional layering . after a while  you just want the movie to end so you can go home  if i had been watching this at home  it would have been much easier to cut my losses  . akshay kumar  s performance is average at best and john abraham should not try doing comedy again . the comedy aspects of the movie overall were pretty week . i only remember giggling like twice the entire movie . definitely no sidesplitting belly laughs that consumed me in hera pheri or even to a lesser extent in awara paagal deewana . paresh rawal had a few of his expected classic moments  but overall  because his role and character wasn  t given much room to grow  he didn  t make much of an impact in this film .  br    br   neha dhupia  who makes only an appearance in the movie  was fun to look at while she was on screen . and some of the songs are fun . especially the opening and closing songs of ada and kiss me baby  respectively . otherwise  you  re better off just passing on this movie .  ,0

after citizen kane in      hollywood executives turned their cob  webbed backs on the great orson welles . with the exception of kane  welles lost all creative control on magnificent ambersons  journey into fear  and many other films to come . welles was an innovative and creative genius  the most unconventional of filmmakers when hollywood was in need of a few more . the lady from shanghai is yet another example of the misunderstood view of welles  films at the time  a movie that seems a bit choppy and non  fluent . it has a conventional      s premise told in a most unconventional way  and i am sure some scenes ended up on the cutting room floor . it is now legend that columbia mogul harry cohn stood up during its initial screening and asked what it was about . in hindsight  many old grumps that ran the studios back then had not one clue as to the cinematic techniques and master story  telling of orson welles and the lady from shanghai is only nearly great because of their intrusion .  br    br   beside being arguably the greatest director of all  time  welles was also quite a performer as an actor . at    we all know what he did as  charles foster kane   perhaps the most famous character in film history . here  he inhabits a rare character of dim wit and not much intelligence  something unfamiliar to those familiar with welles other great work . instead of a slick  wise tongue  he speaks with a rough  irish twang . rita hayworth  his unhappily married wife at the time  plays an unhappily married wife of a lawyer who puts welles in a spell and is able to draw him into a job that will take him to the limits of deception and disillusionment . he is a large lug who may have even murdered a man  but the real mystery lies in the relationship between hayworth  with stunning blonde hair  and crippled hubby everett sloane  mr . bernstein from citizen kane  . a creepy partner of sloane  s is along for the sail around the country to set off a number of peculiar events that has welles   michael o  hara  head spinning . welles narrates the picture as o  hara  but things are still unclear throughout . see for yourself and realize that it takes at least  viewings to fully know exactly what  s up .  br    br   an uncharacteristically strange courtroom sequence centers around  o  hara   with sloane defending him . it is an oddly comedic scene with some quirky courtroom methods  including sloane cross  examining himself . i didn  t really laugh here because the film stalls at this point after a first portion that never gets to take off anyway . up to this point  the cinematography is great  some scenes are shot with craft and skill  aquarium love scene   but there is no distinct line drawing the elements and us  the audience  in . reportedly  the court scene was re  shot against welles  requests    closeups of hayworth were ordered  and a makeshift song sung by the starlet was thrown in at cohn  s insistence . a gaudy score infuriated welles  who once again  was left out of the editing process . thank welles himself for saving the film entirely with a tour  de  force ending that will always be treasured . the so  called  hall of mirrors  scene brings buffs back time and time again  rightfully so .  br    br   it must be seen to be believed and it does a good job of wrapping up some confusing ideas presented . the crash of the mirrors represents  o  hara  s  disillusionment and the  crazy house  itself is a masterpiece of art and set decoration . it seems more like a state of mind than an actual place and is indeed  crazy   twisted and turned like a dali painting . this is a great ending to a flawed picture that if left alone would probably have made the afi  s top    . then again   or  more of orson welles films may have made all collective  best of  lists if he had been left alone to create his own magic .  br    br   note look for the mercury players that are so prominent in welles pictures . they pop up all over . rating  of    ,1
this film is probably pro  muslimization .  br    br   why do i write that  the main character has a muslim father and a christian mother . he lives his first   years in a christian village . in the end of the film he seemingly is a muslim because of his head  wear  that he has kept his amulet  and his general clothing . he has a six year old child  who wears the same head  wear and therefore is probably a muslim  although the mother is a christian . the main character thus chooses to  it seems  to be a muslim and his child becomes a muslim . no one of the other male main characters  which are christians  seems to breed a child . there are more muslims in the world of this movie at the end of it  it therefore seems .  ,0
okay  this film probably deserves  out of   stars  but i  ve voted for     to help offset the misleading rating from the handful of bozo  s who gave this film zero or  star reviews . each of the segments for this anthology shows great potential and promise for the talented filmmakers . . . three of whom have gone on to achieve notable success in big  time hollywood productions . performances range from rough all the way up to completely impressive  with notable turns by bill paxton  james karen  vivian schilling and brion james . martin kove may be a big melodramatic as the psychotic hypnotist with the bizarro strobe  lamp  and lance august seems intentionally dimwitted as an unsuspecting lab victim . but overall  it  s got some great laughs and some genuinely scary moments . definitely worth seeing  so judge for yourself   ,1
pictures that usually glorify a hero have meaning . as an example  bonnie and clyde glorified the dynamic bank robbers and you actually felt sympathy for them despite their evil deeds . why  they were two people caught up in the depression when people were desperate to survive .  br    br   this film has absolutely no substance . the viggo mortensen character soon emerges as a folk hero . why  he speeds along an idaho highway on the way to the hospital where his stricken wife has been taking . no one bothers to understand why he is trying to flee everyone . even worse  when the realization becomes apparent that he is not a red  neck terrorist  no one in government wants to help him as they try to save their rear ends .  br    br   jason priestley co  stars as a radio emcee who builds upon the story in support of our hero .  br    br   the ending is absolutely unbelievable .  ,0
okay this is gona be short and sweet review . . . something the movie should have taken a practice ina nd made its life shorter and sweeter than it was .  br    br   this movie is  . there  s a good reason there was a petition with over        signatures all demanding uwe boll stop making movies from franchises people liked . blood rayne being a biggie there .  br    br   the jokes are good . . . if you  ve never heard them a thousand times before . the acting is descent but u can really only blame the script for that . i even a few moments wonder if they  re even using a script .  br    br   the movie has little to nothing to do with the original games . hello if you  ve played the games u know the main character has no real motivation outside homicidal urges like mass murder because he stubbed his toe or simular . there  s way too much story for such a stupid movie . like i said . i wouldn  t even steal this movie . and for the person who says this is  funniest movie of      . . . . . . . . . . need to take a look around  the news is better than this .  ,0

this movie never made it to theaters in our area  so when it became available on dvd i was one of the first to rent it . for once  i should listened to the critics and passed on this one .  br    br   despite the excellent line up of actors the movie was very disappointing . i can see now why it went straight to video .  br    br   i had thought that with bloom  ledger  and rush it could have some value . all have done wonderful work in the past .  br    br   the movie was slow moving and never pulled me in . i failed to develop much empathy for the characters and had to fight the urge to fast  forward just to get to the end .  br    br   i do not recommend this film even if you are thinking of renting it for only for  eye candy  purposes . it won  t satisfy even that .  ,0
this is just a joke of a movie  they lost me already at the opening scene  spoilerwarning  dangerous creature kills other creature in his cage  this is watched by a scientist that works there on a monitor and guess what she does  well lets go in to the cage to check the stuff out  omg how dumb do those writers think human beings are come on thats the same like jumping in a fish tank with a great white shark because it ate your goldfish . . . pretty useless and even more dumber . and i will not even talk about the cast because they aren  t worth the effort . why they didn  t fired the guy that wrote that immediately is a mystery to me . . . . . and this kinda dumbness continues the entire movie . only good thing where the cgi that is better then average for these kinda low  budget movies .  br    br   if these kinda things don  t bother you go see it  but be warned if your iq is above   you will probably hate it .  ,0
it  s amazing that this movie turns out to be in one of my hitlists after all . it is by far the number  worst movie i have ever seen .  br    br   not only have i ever been this bored before  luckily not for more then    hours   the pre  adolescent attempts at humor that feature it are not even close to getting but one of the corners of my mouth slightly tilted . after the first very awkward part  you tend to hope that the other parts will be at least slightly better . you hope in vain  it only goes downhill from there .  br    br   the movie has no story worth telling whatsoever and repeats this non  story three times . one can only hope that by some miracle all remaining copies of this movie are lost forever and trent harris never lays his hands on a camera again . . .  ,0
there is no way on earth you are going to care about any of these characters . a bunch of spoilt middle class overgrown kids take some drugs at a party and get off with each other and argue . i  ve just seen this on tv and i didn  t think it was a  film  as such  more a post   this life  indulgence that really has no resonance or proper drama to it . stuff like this will get commissioned for time immemorial unfortunately  irrelevant middle class  lifestyle  crap that takes itself far too seriously . it  s got david baddiel in it and that bird out of  cold feet   you know what to expect . there was a lot of this stuff about in      it was a particularly british malaise . . .  they  re educated and doing drugs  friends  but kinda dysfunctional and with incestuous relationships  sounds great   . this kind of nonsense  and post  guy ritchie comedy  gangster stuff . . . dark days . if you have taste  this will annoy you to the point of violence .  ,0
i am quite sure that this was the worst movie ever made . if you can  t make a   year old boy laugh at silly humor you should give up comedy forever . unfortunately joan rivers chose differently . the movie is full of predictable gags  some of these are racist  and very unfunny jokes . particularly memorable is the scene where the doctor tells the lead character that the rabbit has died and he is pregnant  as i write this  i cannot believe this was actually a movie scene  . the man rushes to a dead rabbit on the doctors desk and tries to give it mouth to mouth . rotflmao  not  the punch line that can tell you how bad things are in this movie is  i knew i should have been on top .  ha ha ha ha ah ugh . . . . . . . .  ,0
we expected something great when we went to see this bomb . it is basically a broadway play put on film . the music is plain terrible . there isn  t one memorable song in the movie   heard any hits from this movie  you won  t because there aren  t any . some of the musical numbers go on so long that i got up to go to the restroom and get some pop corn and it was still going when i got back  if they were good songs well   but they suck . the pace is slow  terrible character development . the lead was praised for her singing but sounded like she screamed every song   it was almost impossible to stand . this movie has nothing to offer anyone but die  hard broadway enthusiasts . this is without a doubt the most over rated movie i  ve seen in my entire life . a complete waist of time and money . there is nothing memorable about this movie except danny glover   who wasn  t on screen enough and whose character wasn  t developed enough . rent the video and you  ll agree   this movie was an expensive  over produced  polished dog do .  ,0
the bible teaches us that the love of money is the root of all evil . the love of money leads to greed which can lead to pride and eventually to destruction . two brothers  andy and hank  will discover how far the love of money will cost them and those they love the most .  br    br   andy hanson  philip seymour hoffman  and his younger brother hank  ethan hawke  couldn  t be more different . andy is seemingly enjoying the success of working in new york  s real estate market and is married to his beautiful wife gina  marisa tomei  who is the idea of a trophy wife if one ever existed . hank  however  is divorce who finds himself at the mercy of his ex  wife  his daughter  s expensive school bills  and endless amount of child support payments . a man who means well and has good intentions  hank none the less cannot escape the water that his slowly raising above his head no matter how hard he swims to stay above it .  br    br   however  andy has his own problems with the only difference between him and his brother being that he hides them better . he has committed fraud against his company and is heavily involved in drug use in order to escape his fears . the pressure of his life  and the lies he needs to keep his appearances up  have now caused him to think about fleeing the country with gina in order to start over again . of course  like hank  he needs money to do this and believes he knows how to get it . how  by robbing the jewelery store that their parents own and run . this act of betrayal is where the hanson brothers  their families  and several other lives  will be destroyed because of greed  pride  and fear .  br    br   the uniqueness of before the devil knows you  re dead is the manner in which the story is told . after the robbery goes wrong  and nanette hanson  rosemary harris  who is the mother of both andy and hank is killed  the story is told from a variety of different points of view from various days before and after the robbery attempt . we learn more about the motivations of not only andy and hank but also the reaction to their father charles  albert finney  to the death of his wife . the relationship between charles and his two sons  especially to andy  is also explored and another possible motivation of sorts is discovered after it is revealed that there is little love between the two men . nanette may have been dearly loved by her sons but their father is a different story .  br    br   philip seymour hoffman proves once more why he is one of the most impressive actors in hollywood today by portraying andy as not only a greedy criminal with lack of morality but also  in contradictory way  as a man we can sympathize with . ethan hawke also brings hank alive not just as a loser but really as a man just desperate to hang on to what little he has left . andy and hank are thus brought to life in such a realistic way that it is easy to think of them as not just characters but the very real images of lost and confused men who now find themselves facing the consequence of their actions .  br    br   before the devil knows you  re dead is a moral tale about how our actions lead to consequences that we otherwise might not expect to face . more than that  our choices also can affect those around us in ways we never expected . in what should have been best picture of the year  we see how lives are easily broken when the love of money becomes the ultimate pursuit in order to ease our troubled lives . in other words  there are no easy fixes or answers to our problems and trying to find them can only make things worse .  br    br         ,1
one piece of trivia that is often forgotten about this family film is one of business .  br    br   at the time  in      this movie held the record for the biggest movie premiere in motion picture history  and may continue to hold  . it was held in pittsburgh  pennsylvania  no doubt in honor of the original film  s  angels  who  haunted  the pittsburgh pirates . in this remake they  haunt  the california angels .  br    br   anyway  the premiere was held at the long gone three rivers stadium which was the home of the pittsburgh pirates and the pittsburgh steelers at the time  the pirates are now housed in pnc park and the steelers at heinz field  . the premiere was held on a movie screen that was five stories in height inside the stadium and held  and may even continue to hold  the record for the largest movie premiere in history  shown to       fans . danny glover  tony danza and christopher lloyd were all in attendance to the admiration of thousands of sports fans .  ,1
vivah in my opinion is the best movie of      coming from a director that has proved successful throughout his career . i am not too keen in romantic movies these days  because i see them as  old wine in a new bottle  and so predictable . however  i have watched this movie three times now . . . and believe me it  s an awesome movie .  br    br   vivah goes back to the traditional route  displaying simple characters into a sensible and realistic story of the journey between engagement and marriage . the movie entertains in all manners as it can be reflected to what we do  or would do  when it comes to marriage . in that sense sooraj r . barjatya has done his homework well and has depicted a very realistic story into a well  made highly entertaining movie .  br    br   several sequences in this movie catch your interest immediately  br    br    when shahid kapoor comes to see the bride  amrita rao   the way he tries to look at her without making it too obvious in front of his and her family . the song  do anjaane ajnabi  goes well with the mood of this scene .  br    br    the first conversation between shahid and amrita  when he comes to see her  i . e . a shy shahid not knowing exactly what to talk about but pulling of a decent conversation . also amrita  s naive nature  limited eye  contact  shy characteristics and answering softly to shahid  s questions .  br    br    the emotional breakdown of amrita and her uncle  alok nath  when she feeds him at shahid  s party in the form of another  s daughter  in  law rather than her uncle  s beloved niece .  br    br   clearly the movie belongs to amrita rao all the way . the actress portrays the role of poonam with such conviction that you cannot imagine anybody else replacing her . she looks beautiful throughout the whole movie  and portrays an innocent and shy traditional girl perfectly .  br    br   shahid kapoor performs brilliantly too . he delivers a promising performance and shows that he is no less than salman khan when it comes to acting in a sooraj r . barjatya film . in fact shahid and amrita make a cute on  screen couple  without a shadow of doubt . other characters  alok nath  excellent   anupam kher  brilliant   mohan joshi  very good  .  br    br   on the whole  vivah delivers what it promised  a well made and realistic story of two families . the movie has top  notch performances  excellent story and great music to suit the film  as well as being directed by the fabulous sooraj r . barjatya . it  s a must see   ,1
the story young  goon is a girl whose family has a history of mental illness . she ends up in a mental institution after she starts believing that she is in fact a cyborg . in the institution she meets park il  sun  a young man who develops a bond with her .  br    br   if you  re reading this you probably already know how talented chan  wook park is . but  i  m a cyborg . . .  is a big departure from familiar  and  sadly  stronger territory . i  m a big fan of any film or story which is attempting to do something different . god knows  we all get subjected to enough crap at our local cinemas . the main point about the movie i need to say is  that it fails to say anything about mental illness  or create a characters that you care about .  br    br   this story has to be one of the weirdest things i  ve seen in years . . . but weird isn  t enough . there  s no heart to the movie . . . just surrealism and confusion . confusion does seem to be the main theme of the movie . the characters all try to make sense of their own problems  but it  s chan  wook park himself who proves to be the most confused of them all .  ,0
  fungicide  is quite possibly the most incompetent  embarrassing  pitiful  film  i have ever seen . the acting is criminal  the direction practically non  existent  and the special effects presumably put together by unleashing a monkey with learning difficulties on a defenceless laptop computer .  br    br   far be it from me to stifle creativity  but i actually believe things like this shouldn  t be made . i am sure the  film   makers will say that  yes  the  film  was hampered by a low  as in nothing  budget  but in that case they just really shouldn  t have bothered . as it is  they have offered the world something so dire  so execrable  that only imbeciles could get the merest shade of enjoyment from it .  br    br   starting the  movie  it wasn  t as though i was expecting  citizen kane  or anything . i was expecting a low budget little horror with perhaps a modicum of inventiveness  a hint of fun  and even some energy . what i got was the cinematic equivalent of a used handkerchief .  br    br   the plot  well  our leering antihero scientist  who works in his parents  basement  is seen manically stirring some goo in a cup . apparently  such high  level science is the end  result of years of research . his parents then send him off to a strange hotel  type place in the countryside to relax . there are some other people there  who are simply too awful to write about . anyway  the scientist drops his test  tube onto some mushrooms  and soon the mushrooms grow and kill some people .  wow  i  m getting suicidal just writing the plot summary  . our heroes save the day by detonating a barrel of balsamic vinegar  by attaching a  fuse   really a piece of string  to it  . the barrel unaccountably explodes with the power of a small nuclear weapon  destroying all the mushrooms . the end .  thank goodness  .  br    br   that summary is as good as the  film  gets  and actually makes it sound a lot more interesting than it actually is  . it really should never have got past this stage of development  by which i mean a plot outline scribbled on the back of an envelope with crayons  . somebody should have really stepped in and given someone a vigorous shake and said  no .   br    br   and those  special  effects . well  they  re  special  all right . this is cgi gone crazy . and done by a person who i can only assume believes the bicycle pump to be the pinnacle of modern technology . and when the mushroom monsters are not in the style of a     home computer graphics package  they are represented by actors shuffling along covered in a sheet  i kid you not  .  br    br   one of the most inexcusable things about the movie is its laziness . this can be summed up by the scene in which the hero spins his guns  a la clint eastwood  and then fails miserably to get them in his pockets . i mean come on  a couple of retakes and he could have pulled it off  but just to leave it as it is  really weak .  br    br   i cannot believe money was spent on this camcorder  shot rubbish . the  film   makers should hang their heads in shame and be banned from going within fifty metres of any movie  making equipment .  br    br   i also think it  s wrong that friends and family of the makers come onto imdb and post mendacious reviews and give stupidly high user ratings which give a totally inaccurate picture of the  movie .   fungicide  is an absolute travesty of film  making . mr wascavage is either very  very stupid or very  very cynical .  ,0
director edward montagne does in a little more than one hour what other  more expensive and hyped films fail to do . mr . montagne shows us a police story written by phillip h . reisman jr . that while  is not one of the best of the genre  it keeps the viewer involved in all that  s going on .  br    br   this is clearly a b type movie . in fact  the best thing going for  the tattooed stranger  is the opportunity to take a peek at the way new york looked in those years . the crystal clear cinematography by william o . steiner  either has been kept that way through the years  or has been lovingly restored .  br    br   there are great views of new york in the opening sequence . later we are taken to brooklyn to the dumbo section and later on the film travels to the bronx and the gun hill road area with its many monument stores in the area .  br    br   john miles and walter kinsella made a great detective team . patricia barry is perfect as the plant expert from the museum of natural history . jack lord  who went to bigger things in his career  is seen in a non speaking role .  br    br   it was great fun to watch a city  as it was  because it doesn  t exist any more .  ,1

no real plot to this one  just a series of short skits acting out some very old jokes . i chuckled once or twice in the beginning  much to my chagrin . but even at only   minutes this film wears out it  s welcome before too long and becomes stale and tedious  with some nudity sprinkled in here and there to keep you awake  . still as bad as this movie is  and that  s pretty putrid   it  s a comedic gem compared to pretty much anything by aaron seltzer  jason friedberg  date movie  epic movie  meet the spartans  also the song is sadly kind of catchy in a sad way .  br    br   eye candy   pair of tits   bushes   asses  br    br   my grade d  br    br   code red dvd extras original trailer for this film and trailers for  beyond the door    dead pit    the farmer    obsessed ones    power play    sole survivor     wacky taxi   ,0
 . . . except for jon heder . this guy tanked the entire movie .  br    br   the plot sounded entertaining . a   year old slacker son  heder  still lives with widowed mom  keaton  who happens to meet a new love  daniels  . slacker son is jealous and anxious to lose his comfortable life and tries to sabotage the relationship . he also meets a girl  faris  .  br    br   i really liked the performance of daniels and especially faris but whoever casted hader would be better of selling hot dogs at the beach . heders performance is annoying  which would be a good thing since he plays an annoying guy  problem is he is to bad an actor to loose this act making this guy likable in the finale . at the end you still wish you can personally punch the guy in the face and you  re upset about the end . in the future every movie with this guy will be a no go for me   ,0
ok  the portrayal of the stereotyped  indians  in this story is just plain wrong . i do agree that elvis looks rather good here  but yeah  his skin color does seem to change during the movie . i was thinking  ok  . . . he was never that tan in real life . it  s some of the most obvious brown  indian  makeup that i have ever seen . it  s as bad as the  indians  on  f  troop  and the old hollywood westerns who were played by jewish and italian american actors and not real native americans   br    br   this movie is o . k .  but typically lame story and mediocre songs  like in all of elvis  later films . he just did them because colonel parker had him tied down to long term movie contacts to squeeze as much money out of elvis as possible  i keep thinking  thank god  that elvis stopped making movies forever not long after this movie came out . it is cool to see character actors joan blondell  katy jurado  l . q . jones  henry jones and burgess meredith in this movie  though .  br    br   burgess meredith  s  indian  makeup is absolutely awful . it  s the worst of the bunch for sure . what were the filmmakers thinking  was mr . meredith doing this one just for the money or what  i do love certain elvis movies  though . for example  love me tender    jailhouse rock    viva las vegas  . i can even stand to watch his movie with future tv co  stars mary tyler moore and ed asner   change of habit  in which elvis plays an inner  city doctor .  br    br   oh well  at least elvis made a few good films  but the mediocre and bad ones overwhelm the decent and good ones .  br    br   i  ll always love elvis  thank you  thank you very much   ,0
i don  t understand why the other comments focus on mcconaughey . he has never been a very interesting film actor .  br    br   the best part of this movie is the writing and the wit . alfred molina and patrick mcgaw make an unusual comic duo  definitely not stock types . although one can  t say their characters are well developed that doesn  t make them any less funny .  br    br   the version i saw was on hdnet and had subtitles for the spanish dialog  so that was certainly not a problem . the use of spanish gives it more authenticity .  br    br   a very underrated movie  judging by the unusually low score imdb members have given it . i thought it was fun and interesting and worth a  at least . a lot of slick movies with higher scores and making big money at the box office are much less interesting .  ,1
this is the worst show i have seen in years . i believe that it should be taken off of t . v . because of its retardedness . it is so dumb i could faint when i watch it .  even though i never watch it because it is sooooo poor   br    br   goofs when mac says he cant eat sugar  in another episode he eats sugar . almost everything in the world has sugar in it    in episode  eddie monster  when eddy screams at terrance he falls into the crate twice plus the seconed time he falls in he doesn  t fall in  he falls off to the side . what stupidity . i can  t even say the word fosters home . i even made a song with my band about how retarded this show is . byyyyyyyyeeeee  ,0
this movie has the made for tv stink all over it . though  it started out with great intentions  featuring great looking sets and authentic props and costumes . the film quickly degenerated into horrible on the nose cheesy dialogue  and rushed tv sappy melodramatic acting . the characters were so sappy that at times i thought that they are about to degenerate into a bilious puddle of goo  and the action was so convoluted and poorly cut that it looked as it the soldiers were merely standing around and taking turns shooting at one another . the germans were so unrealistically depicted that it was painful to watch . the only thing that the german officers talked about was how wonderful the americans are . please take my word for this . i am a huge fan of the war genre  and this movie is crap . nevertheless  this dvd does have an excellent extra feature  covering letters from the wwi front lines  thus making this rental not a total waste of my time .  ,0
at the end of the movie i still don  t know whether i liked it or not . so was the case with most of the reviewers . but none the less i still feel that the movie is worth a  for the amount of efforts put in .  br    br   long ago i read a quote there are  kind of writers   . those who think and write . and  . those write and make the readers think . while here i feel that guy ritchie took this way too literally and left all the thinking for the audience .  br    br   i felt that the movie was a mixed bag filled with some of the devils advocate and fight club . . . .  br    br   it is definitely a classic something which no one understands but appreciates . . . .  br    br   what i don  t understand why stathom  jake green  had a blackout  thats how it all began   all the riddles and mysteries in the movie have been taken care of except this one .  br    br   well if you are reading this review to find the solution as what this movie was all about i  ll post the very midnight it strikes me and if you are still deciding to watch this movie or not then answer this first . . . . when you come across a puzzle labeled as  no one has ever solved  would you like to try   br    br   i would  ,1
more than just a  kids  movie    holes  looks at how past incidents still affect us today  whether we know about them or not . when teenager stanley yelnats iii  shia leboeuf  gets sent to a prison camp where he is forced to dig all day long  he discovers a number of things about the camp  and his personal connection to it . through flashbacks  we learn that a number of things are closer than we realize  you  ll understand this better when you see the movie  . leboeuf does a pretty good job  as do the other cast members sigourney weaver  jon voight  tim blake nelson  henry winkler  patricia arquette  and eartha kitt . a very interesting movie .  ,1
i still can  t believe this movie . they got so much unbelievable things in it  that it  s hard to believe anyone wanted to make it .  br    br   the story is a joke  but in the sense of being funny  but more like no story at all . how can you mix a slapstick comedy with a train robbery  a prison movie  town conspiracies  sex  jokes and a fbi  agent  you can  t .  br    br   beside the terrifying directing the most noticeable thing are the actors . i watched this film and thought  is this really marlon brando  no  it can  t be .   minutes later  is this charlie sheen  wow  maybe brando is true .   minutes later  this can  t be donald sutherland .   minutes later  no  not mira sorvino . this movie is too bad for all of them .  at the end  . no  no  no  this can  t absolutely not be martin sheen    not for   seconds of such a movie .  then it was over and i down with my nerves . so many good  oscar  winning  usually convincing actors in such a stupid  dumb  awful movie . i rarely wanted to know so much how they came to act in this one . they couldn  t got so much money .  br    br   only just an unbelievable silly idiotic movie .  br    br                     ,0
a group of us watched this film are were really disgusted . we were willing to forgive the fact that our favorite character jo wasn  t on  it  s not like the writers  producers could do anything about that  . the writing was poor  the script was sub  par . what really annoyed us  . when the two guys realized they were both dating natalie  they didn  t just leave they put up with that stupid  and ultimately degrading  contest  but only because they were macho competing guys  not because they really wanted natalie .  . despite being unable to choose between the two guys before the reunion  natalie suddenly decides that she really loves one of the guys and is now ready to marry him   and there was no foreshadowing that he was really a better guy  it  s as if the writers flipped a coin and then just had her spit it out at some convenient point in the film  .  . blair makes a point of talking about how she does not want children and then all of a sudden when her husband says he wants to have children  she blissfully agrees with him .  ,0
who would  ve imagined   hal hartley creates a filmic corollary to syriana while retaining his signature idiosyncratic style . the fusion is highly entertaining .  br    br   having not seen a hal hartley film for about a decade  i approached this one with some caution . his brilliant productions of the nineties had impressed critics and audiences with their unique style and dialog . the director  s earlier films featured colorful characters and offered close observations of life   often in the region of long island  new york or in new york city itself   that were offbeat and insightful .  br    br   my initial caution stemmed from the description of this movie as a  spy thriller  . to my pleasant surprise  hartley manages to mesh his well established style and focus to produce a highly original drama of international intrigue . it works in more ways than one might imagine . hartley  s film retains the dialog and character focus that are his trademarks  along with a singular cinematographic style .  br    br   moreover it is highly appropriate given the current situation in the world and the state of war that has been fostered by dark elements on all sides . hartley has brought all his skills to something new   a political film worthy of being mentioned in the same breath as syriana . truly he is coming into his own . the cast does a fine job of interpreting hartley  s vision and style . fans of parker posey will see her in full bloom here  still with us and more ripe and gorgeous than before .  ,1
it  s a shame that this piece of work wasn  t acknowledged as a piece of work . it has everything a historical film must have a serious historical research  outstanding performances of every actor involved and a discrete but great direction .  br    br   when i saw the movie i knew it should be a prototype for every biographical movie .  ,1
this is something new .  br    br   there  s a coup d  etat and a couple of irish documentary filmmakers are right inside of it .  br    br   a democratically elected president who uses his power to bring literacy to his people and encourages them to read the constitution is being slandered by the private media openly as dictator  mentally unstable  new hitler  etc . without repercussion from the governments side  like  say  silencing them via bullets and other traditional dictatorial methods  . oh  and they still claim that they are being suppressed  of course .  br    br   see how the media gloats about their own role in the coup d  etat on tv after they toppled the government with the help of rouge generals  how much more stupid can you get    .  br    br   and see how the people of venezuela march to the palace  holding the constitution in their hands  and reinstall their elected government .  br    br   this sounds like a hollywood fairytale  but it happened for real  against the explicit wishes of the usa . the documentary is a historical masterpiece  shot from the center of the action  acute and totally embarrassing for the prime supporters of the coup the good  democratic  freedom loving  benevolent usa  who still channel large amounts of money to chavez  political opponents  .  br    br   also highly entertaining and exciting .   points .  ,1
this is a very grim  hard hitting  even brutal film about a death row break that goes awry . it  s black and white photography keeps it from being dated . mickey rooney is excellent as the twisted  yet strangely sympathetic lead . one of the first movies to portray the psychological desolation of death row . it is also quite poignant .  ,1
off the blocks let me just say that i am a huge zombie fan so i don  t make statements like the above lightly . secondly let me say that this is an italian zombie film and fulci only directed   minutes of it before handing over to bruno  rats  night of terror  mattei . this is no dawn of the dead folks .  br    br   that said this is easily one of the most entertaining zombie films i have ever seen .  br    br   the script is wonderfully horrible . just check out the two scientists trying to find an antidote   let  s try putting these two molecules together   .  br    br   the zombies come in all varieties . from moaning shufflers  to machete wielding maniacs  to birds   br    br   the gore is plentiful . legs are bitten off  arms amputated  stomachs burst open .  br    br   the pace is fast  flying from one zombie attack to the next .  br    br   then there  s the head in the fridge . oh the head in the fridge  one of the greatest moments in horror since ash got his hand possessed in evil dead  .  br    br   you should know already whether you  re the sort of person who  s going to like this sort of film . get some mates and some beer and you  ll be in for a fun night .  br    br   did i mention the head in the fridge       ,1
a somewhat typical bit of filmmaking from this era . obviously  it was first conceived into this world for the stage  but nonetheless a very good film from beginning to end . peter o  toole and susannah york get to do their stage performance act for the silver screen and both do it effectively . there is very little in the way of story and anyone not familiar with this type of off beat character study may be a little put off by it . all in all  though  a good film in which peter o  toole and susannah york get to overact .  ,1

 warning  this post may contain spoilers   br    br   i only got a gamecube in september      and the first two games i bought were james bond games  the decent agent under fire and the dull goldeneye rogue agent . the next game i planned to get was everything or nothing  because my friend told me that it was better than the two games i already had . i have to say  he was right .  br    br   i bought this for a tenner in hmv  and when i got home  i slammed it in to my cube and played it for hours on end . it was much better than my other two games  and there was a much better and more interesting storyline . graphics were some of the best i have seen  but now that the xbox    has come out  farcry instincts predator has some of the best graphics known to man  . the storyline was clever mad man  willem dafoe  named as nikolai diavolo  and beautiful henchwoman  heidi klum  named as katya nadanova   try to destroy the world with tiny nanobots  which at the start of the game  you  james bond  have to destroy on a train . the bad thing is that one of them is hidden in katya  s boobs . you then have to thwart their plans and save the world .  br    br   the great thing about this game is that it actually has actors voicing the characters  such as cleese voicing q . there are   levels  some of them short and some of them pretty long and tricky .  br    br   gameplay       graphics      sound      replay value      multiplayer       br    br   i give this game a grand total of     ,1
i absolutely loved this movie . i am not even sure what particularly about it but i think it was wonderful and should be available for dvd . the women were strangers and yet got along well enough to spend the time they did in the villa in italy . the actors  in my opinion  did an excellent job . the characters were all so different and yet clever story that made it work . there is humor  drama and relationship issues all in good time . this requires   lines but i just can  t think of any more to say so i will just rattle on until i get   lines . so sorry about this . what else can i possibly say it has been a long time since i last saw it . i am looking forward to view again but it isn  t available .  ,1
don  t listen to the prissy critics who are probably bitter gamers still sore from the roasting silverman infamously gave them at spike tv video game awards a couple of months ago   the sarah silverman  is wonderfully bizarre  surreal  immature  ridiculous and would fit rather nicely in a adult swim line  up . if silverman tones down the juvenile  doody  jokes and emphasizes the darker  meaner undercurrent the show is so far just hinting at  we could have one of the greatest cult comedies since the cancelled  strangers with candy  . but just from watching the pilot  its just solid  not outstanding  offbeat dark comedy  musical but with huge potential .  br    br   silverman has created a hilarious child  woman of a character  a prettier  younger  jewish american princess version of the late great jerri blank and the show features one of the most unconventional  non  stereotypical portrayals of a gay couple i have ever seen on television . early reviews are suggesting the next couple of episodes surpass the pilot so i can  t wait to see how this show unfolds .  ,1
where to start  this movie started badly and ended badly  it consists of extremely poor acting and unrealistic effects that had me cringing in my seat  seriously  my cat could have acted better than this lot .  br    br   some of it was actually laughable because it was so unbelievable  i would of rated this lower but they haven  t got anything else  so  heed my warning and unless your so bored your close to suicide and would like a good reason to continue with your suicide mission  don  t bother with this one . i  m still in shock that this could actually be released to the public  this should be a crime and all involved should be arrested . i gather you  ve got the gist by now so i  ll leave it up to you to decide .  ,0
i rented this for my son who is recently found interest in     . he was a kindergartener at the time and had no idea what was unfolding . i liked the way it was told as a  documentary .  if there was one movie that i would recommend to see concerning      this would be the one  normally you see a movie it has actors that are well known . this movie had nobody known . also  you see a movie concerning      you hear about a fire  fighter or two losing their lives saving people . i didn  t feel this had any of that  i only rented this movie and would definitely consider adding it to my collection  very well done indeed  my heart goes out to the survivors and families of victims of       ,1

typical    s comedy  situational comedy similar to our modern day  my family  . thatcher being the height of most political jokes  bill  belinda lang  blames thatcher for anything she can .  bloody thatcher  possibly shared with most of us . david the typical teenager  cutting up brains with bread knives  jenny  the moody older teenage child  only interested in boys and more boys . bill and ben working as much as they can to keep their family afloat struggling within the economical climate of the early    s . granted the first two series were not as successful as the latter however  series  onwards is where it all kicks off with more laughs that i care to count . overall this show didn  t get the best viewing times and they ought to have held on a bit longer . clearly they couldn  t have carried on after gary olsen died but i think they should get rid of  catherine tate   the office   little britain  and bring back the classics   ,1
  the last wave  is far more than the sum of its parts . it  s not merely a disaster film  not simply an exploration into australian aboriginal spirituality  and certainly more than a simple court drama . writer  director peter weir manages to take these elements to the next level to produce a truly effective and thought  provoking film with the same eerie atmosphere he gave to  picnic at hanging rock  two years earlier  that you will continue to remember years later .  br    br   when lawyer david burton  chamberlain  is called to defend chris lee  gulpilil  over the death of an aboriginal for which he may or may not be directly responsible  he finds himself not merely struggling to get the truth from lee  but making sense of what he hears when it does come . as with the aboriginal belief that there are two worlds  the everyday and the dreamtime  the truth exists on two completely different levels  with ramifications more disastrous than burton could ever have imagined .  br    br   no doubt the reason why  picnic at hanging rock  is better remembered is because of its enduring mystery . we are led along the same path but forced to find answers for ourselves . in  the last wave   we can piece everything together by the end of the film . however  even with all the information  we have to choose how much of it we want to believe  because the film takes us beyond the borders of our normal realities .  br    br   on the production side  weir uses his budget to great effect  progressively building a sense of doom in everything from soft lighting  to heavy rain  to good use of sound . the incidental music is unobtrusive  never trying to be grandiose . richard chamberlain manages to convey the bafflement the audience would doubtless feel as he tries to unravel the mystery . david gulpilil excellently portrays a man trapped between two worlds  wanting to do the right thing  but afraid because he already knows the ending .  br    br   put all these things together  and you have a perfect example of why david weir is a familiar name in cinema thirty years on . strongly recommended .  ,1
hi  everyone  if you saw  singing in the rain   you remember the scene of gene kelly dancing in the rain . you also remember the dance number of donald o  connor   make  em laugh .  if you saw  royal wedding   you will remember fred astaire dancing on the ceiling . if you saw  jailhouse rock   you will even remember the title dance number choreographed by the king himself .  br    br   that is what is missing here . there could have been some blockbuster dance numbers in this presentation . the closest was chuck mcgowan  s  i can do that .  the mere fact that you have some talented people on stage moving together does not make a great dance film . richard attenborough was to blame for this failure . he pointed the camera at the stage and thought that would be a good thing .  br    br   yelling at people auditioning for a part in a broadway production is not entertainment . michael douglas would be just as badly cast if he were in a western or a comedy . he is ok when he is in a michael douglas movie where we see him yelling at someone we would like to yell at . it does not work here .  br    br   the cast was good except for michael  of course . a good movie could have been made even using the songs that were in the stage production  but someone should have thought about how to film it .  br    br   next time they do one of these i hope they call me first .  br    br   tom willett  ,0
this film is based on the novel by john fante . could someone please tell me why  i see absolutely no reason why this fine book should be adapted in this way . if you want to make a romantic melodramatic hollywood production with colin farell and selma hayek  then how could you possibly make a connection to ask the dust  the novel    and if you wanted to make this story into a film  then why would you want to make it into a romantic melodramatic hollywood production with colin farell and selma hayek  i don  t get it .  br    br   the adaptation of the story is poorly made  and if you have read the book and liked it  i  m almost sure you won  t like what towne did with it .  br    br   in the beginning of the film you  ll maybe find the casting odd  the acting bad and the cinematography just a bit overdone . but you hope for the best . i really hoped a lot during this film . i actually wanted it to be good . but it only gets worse  and it is as simple as that whether you read fantes novel or not  this is not a good film . just another romantic melodramatic hollywood production combined with bad acting  lack of structure and  of course  plenty of shots of colin farells naked butt .  br    br   i could complain a lot more about this film  but why waste my time . i  ve seen it . alright . i had to see it  because i like the book so much and was curious . and i  m very disappointed .  br    br       is for colin  s sweet little mustache in the end of the film . so sweet . . . had he worn it the whole time through  i  d given it     .  ,0

with a simplistic story and an engaging heroine  this was the horror movie that started it all . john carpenter brings to life a nail  biting nightmare on halloween night  when laurie strode  jamie lee curtis in her debut  career defining role  and her mischievous friends plan a night of sneaky fun  only to cross paths with a relentless psychopath from hell .  br    br   michael myers has escaped from a nearby insane aslyum . . . having slaughtered his sister fifteen years earlier  he is now back in haddonfield  the sleepy illinois town where his murder took place . once he sets his eyes on laurie after she drops off a package to the abandoned house where he lived  he begins to stalk and terrorize her  turning her night of fun into terror as he picks off anyone in his path to get to her .  br    br   beautiful cinematography and lighting really make this moody horror flick scary . . . with the long gloomy shots it constantly feels as if you  re being stalked by the maniacal serial killer himself . myers is hidden well until fully revealed at the exciting conclusion .  br    br   although  halloween  is certainly outdated  it is by no means less chilling . the idea alone is goose bump inducing  and this little shocker is one of the most famous and memorable horror movies ever made to this day . . . it spawned seven sequels and eventually rob zombie  s equally scary remake  and it set a new standard for horror that still exists today .  ,1
skip mccoy  richard widmark  pick  pockets candy  s  jean peters  wallet which contains an important microfiche that is intended for the communist cause . she is being followed by  federal agents that are waiting to pounce once she hands the microfiche over to her contact . however  skip steals the purse on the subway under everyone  s noses and so starts a hunt for him by both the police and joey  richard kiley  and candy who want the microfiche back . skip can only be traced through moe  thelma ritter  who sells information on criminals . it is made clear to skip that what he has stolen is important and both sides want the film  but he intends to hold out for a high price . this leads to joey hunting after him and a conflict between joey and jean  who has fallen in love with skip . joey has a deadline to deliver the microfiche to his boss .  br    br   its a well  acted film and it has a good beginning that gets you involved straight away . its a bit unrealistic how jean peters immediately falls in love with widmark  but this point is necessary as otherwise why would she later hold out from joey . its a good film .  ,1
i loved this movie  i am biased seeing as i am a huge disney fan  but i really enjoyed myself . the action takes off running in the beginning of the film and just keeps going  this is a bit of a departure for disney  they don  t spend quite as much time on character development  my husband pointed this out  and there are no musical numbers . it is strictly action adventure . i thoroughly enjoyed it and recommend it to anyone who loves disney  be they young or old .  ,1

i  d give it a     .  br    br   i was really  really disappointed .  br    br   the storyline was poorly developed  for instance  the incidents were too short and brief  hence the moral was not clearly brought out . i thought brenda song did a fine job  but shin koyamada seemed to have a difficult time handling his role . i could see the need to put in western elements in the show  however  there are certain parts  where chinese elements were needed too  the villain for example . his physical appearance resembled a robot  instead of something out of the chinese culture . the final and the worst flaw  were the incorrect  and distorted facts placed in the show .  br    br   others may point out that this is a  kid  s show  and hence  there is no need for the such high standards . however  there are other disney shows  such as mu lan  which have been much better in terms of story development and presentation .  br    br   in conclusion  i feel that disney movies should be better researched and better planned . a good show is not enough with just a series of martial arts moves to depend on .  ,0
i have yet to read a negative professional review of this movie . i guess i must have missed something . the beginning is intriguing  the three main characters meet late at night in an otherwise empty bar and entertain each other with invented stories . that  s the best part . after the three go their separate ways  the film splits into three threads . that  s when boredom sets in . certainly  the thread with the felliniesque babushkas who make dolls out of chewed bread is at first an eye opening curiosity . unfortunately  the director beat this one to death  even injecting a wild plot line that leads nowhere in particular . bottom line a two  hour plot  thin listlessness . if you suffer from insomnia  view it in bed and you will have a good night sleep .  ,0
there are moments in this unique cartoon of pure beauty but overall it  s not very good . limited animation as well as sub standard character and background design will limit its mass market appeal . the character design looks like a cross between the original star wars clone wars and disney  s kim possible   brendan  the main character in this also bares an uncanny similarity to ron stoppable in kim possible  background design ranges as far and wide as going from being bland and depressing to stylish and stark  yet by today  s standards  overall it is still poor and cheap looking . many of the backgrounds bare resemblances to eastern european or nordic animation from the mid    s  nice in its own way but for modern child audiences  used to cg slug fests and talking dogs with every piece of fur on their body swaying in the wind  is sure to disappoint . the story is also not overly engaging and many of the voice actors aren  t overly impressive  noticeably the usually brilliant brendan gleeson who appears to be phoning in his part . there are also a few secondary characters who come across as slightly clich and stereotypically racist . however  some of the characters are good  the viking villains  although underused are well done and are specifically foreboding in both look and sound . there is one moment involving the main character and his mentor being saved by wolves from a viking attack that is very nicely put together . the look and feel also seemed to be very inspired by the film watership down including a blatant rip off  homage to the ghost rabbit of inlay . the look is also clearly and obviously inspired by gaelic  celtic  anglo saxon art so if you are into these subjects you may be drawn towards its look . the film also does have moments of very nicely structured shots leading the eye in a very artistic manner  including a pretty match cut and a large scale viking attack that is very moody and impressive . best of all though is the music  much of the background music is melodic and moving  specifically the song by the spirit girl which is truly beautiful and haunting and works very well with the images it covers . if the whole film was as poetic as this moment   and it tries   then this would be a very beautiful and poetic film that would sadly still not reach a wide audience  but instead it isn  t a shame it wont reach a wider audience because most of it is average and cheap looking and doesn  t stand up to modern animation standards . overall a film that clearly split my opinion in many ways  but all together not great but worth watching for the music and song and the occasional pretty or scary moment . oh yeah and the cat seemed to live for a long time  not sure how that was possible .  ,0
i saw this movie on a westbound american airlines flight . it was so bad it actually made the flight seem longer . the plot had potential  who wouldn  t love a movie about a woman who accidentally kills every elvis impersonator she meets   but it got screwed up a million different times by really poor writing . towards the end is an embarrassingly bad scene where a gang of elvis impersonators is on the roof of a casino reshipping the sky thinking he  s going to return  then a group of stars moves together to form an  elvis  constellation  which promptly shoots a bolt of lightning at the impersonators  sending them crashing through the roof . bad . . . really bad . which is the theme for the whole movie . i  d avoid this one at all costs .  ,0
where to begin  anachronism  high tech cross bow with a scope in about    ad  arrows with explosive charges in    ad  a monster grendel that looks like a robocop and obviously never interacts with any of the weapons fired or swung against him  the heart torn out of his victim  s chest without any sense of contact  possibly the blond who would fit in on a recent fashion show with her make  up and streaked hair  the ancient danish court represented in classical greek style  the queen played by marina sirtis more savaged by her makeup artist than by madness  the effects are way too weak to carry this story . there are some stories that don  t mind or even benefit from cheap effects  but this grendel isn  t one of them .  br    br   what about characters who seem to jump about in their attitudes without motivation  a bravado idiot prince whose home has already been savaged more than once by the monster grendel seems to have less respect for the danger he faces than beowulf who was sent from afar from the land of the geats to help the desperate danes . in this it feels more like an old cowboy western than any kind of myth .  br    br   beowulf is an ancient tale from an era with almost no literary tradition and much of both its sentiment and its drama is obscure . i suspect that any modern telling which doesn  t make an intelligent attempt to penetrate the obscurity must fail . i didn  t love the recent  beowulf and grendel  which sees grendel essentially as human and sees hrothgar and his danes as too arrogant and stupid to recognize grendel  s attacks as well  justified vengeance  but i had to respect its revisionist position that hrothgar  s danes were a bunch of macho thugs who never grasped  even after it was all over  that they had brought this nightmare on themselves  and therefore  the original story of beowulf  as it was written  was a misrepresentation of the real story . i think there  s a more complex meaning to be understood than that  but this  grendel  s  terrible secret that grendel  s attacks are tied to previous human sacrifice doesn  t really bring us closer to the shame experienced by hrothgar and the danes .  br    br   this beowulf has little to recommend it as traditional myth or as modern fantasy . i give it a   higher than it deserves  but always hopeful that a poor effort will draw attention by someone who is up to telling the story intelligently . in the meantime  sci  fi  s movie  making seems to be following the nasa policy that it  s better to build lots of probes that fail than a few that succeed .  ,0
this film wasn  t programmed in italian cinemas  i have seen it at a manifestation called  fantafestival  . i find it terrible because some scenes seems like music videos chaotic and dark  the use of fluorescent colors is ridicule and there  s no suspence in the film . music is completely out of the story and i don  t have words to describe the visual effects . if you look at the first scene the film seems to be interesting  but a few minutes later it becomes busy . the story is interesting but the development needs a complete review .  ,0
as far as heist movies go  this one is pretty weak . continuity is pretty lousy  there isn  t enough character continuity to really feel like you understand any of the characters . peter falk is great  and he is one of the reasons its worth watching . falk has some great lines  like  he  ll be right back  he goin  buy to some saugages  or something like that . . . there are a few nice scenes  although they are entirely due to the efforts of the actors . direction  script  and editing is pretty lousy .  ,0
 . . . through the similarly minded antics of eric stanze . a not  particularly talented director has helmed a not  particularly good movie  yet i still found myself sitting through it to the closing credits  if for nothing more than to see what happens next .  br    br   a rapist escapes from prison and calls up his old flame . after capturing her  even though she came willingly  and threatening her into having sex  another event she was also willing to do  he reveals that he has kidnapped three guys who wronged her in the past . he then decides to kill her  huh   but is foiled and dies instead . the girl  s mind snaps  or something like that  and she takes out her rage on the unlucky chaps in the basement .  br    br   alright  the writing sucks it  s long winded  loaded with ten  cent words and there is way too much of it .  br    br   the acting sucks what a minute  what acting   br    br   the filming sucks home video is bad enough  but   minutes of graveyard footage is just a damn insult .  br    br   and the budget is a joke get it . . .  budget   that was the punchline .  br    br   and yet there was a charm to the thing . back in the    s these kind of movies came out in theatres with actual budgets and talent attached to them  not in this day and age though . if you want to watch this kind of violent  sexually exploitive trash  don  t lie  some of us do  then this is all your gonna get nowadays .  br    br   some brief hardcore shots in a sex scene  torture with fecal material  fun with axes  anal rape by broom stick and a lengthy shot of the crazy chick masturbating with the same broom stick are some of the better items on the menu .  br    br   it  s not good and it won  t be remembered  but not since the heyday of joe d  amato have people made movies like this .  br    br        ,0
no  this is not no alice fairy tale my friends  this wonderland  fable is based on the true story of the gruesome bloody wonderland murders that occurred back in    s california . at the center of this bloodbath was no other than johnny wad  himself . yes  john holmes  daddy ding  dong used other shotguns than his infamous    inch milk machine . besides being a legendary adult film actor  holmes was as also a hardcore drug addict who befriended various hollywood junkies . val kilmer was occasionally majestic as holmes  but for once this holmes character did not milk it through completely . the film possesses a who  s who  of supporting players josh lucas  dylan mcdermott as hollywood riffraffs  kate bosworth  lisa kudrow as the women in holmes life  and eric bogosian as a menacing tinsletown entrepreneur . these characters do play integral parts  directly or indirectly  in the wonderland  murders . out of this support group  it was josh lucas who was the most fierce  impressive as the ardent ron launius . lucas is gradually escalating into a major hollywood player with such charismatic turns in a beautiful mind   sweet home alabama  . director james cox sometime proved to be a bit of a coxsucker by displaying a vast amount of overextended scenes  just like holmes  famous organ . holmes was eventually acquitted of the wonderland  murders . he died of complications from the aids virus . wonderland  will keep you wondering what really happened that bloody night  and if holmes really laid out his weapon . oops  wrong holmes movie  ok  that is enough before i get penislized  i mean penalized . bye holmies   average  ,1
robert wuhl is teaching a class of film students at new york university in manhattan  new york .  br    br   he covers fallacies of history and truths that are no longer generally known . i would like to see much more of this show . it is very entertaining . mr . wuhl uses examples and  show and tell  to get his points across . he explained that the person who actually rode the midnight ride of paul revere was not paul revere  henry wadsworth longfellow used revere  s name because it sounded better .  br    br   i  ve watched robert wuhl for many years  from the time he was doing stand  up comedy and all the way through  arli  on hbo . he  s a good actor and a good stand  up comedian  but he  s an excellent teacher  i highly recommend that you watch an episode of this show . it is well worth your time .  ,1
watching  kroko  i would have liked to leave the cinema very much for the first time in my life . i would not recommend to watch this movie flat main characters  absolutely no development e . g . kroko the metaphoric german problem child remains a pure metaphor without any capability of positive involvement despite several plot  wise chances to do so . uninspired actors  non  evolving plot . i guess the movie attempted an environmental survey but did not succeed camera appeared shaky rather than motivated . pictures were low  contrast  gray and dark  i am sure deliberately but the components did not add up to a convincing impression of the social milieu . the story had certain potential though  it could have made a good short story .  ,0
so . . . it  s really sexist  and classist  and i thought that it might not be in the beginning stages of the movie  like when stella tells steven that she would really like to change herself and begin speaking in the right way and he tells her not to change . well  he certainly changed his tune  and it seems that the other reviewers followed suit . what at the beginning appears to be a love story is really about social placement and women as sacrificial mothers . the end of the movie does not make her a hero  it makes the whole thing sad . and its sad that people think it makes her a hero . perhaps that is the comment of the movie that people should take away . positive reception reflects continual patriarchal currents in the social conscience . yuck .  ,0

i saw  mystery men  on my birthday in     while i was away on vacation . when i came back home  i went to see it again . keep in mind  i was twelve  but at that time it was the coolest movie ever . i even collected the ultra  rare action figures  i have them all except for the bowler  which is the hardest to find . they made mr . furious  the shoveler  the blue raja  the spleen and captain amazing  in case your wondering . there is a william h . macy action figure in existence   . i  ve watched it many times over the years and it still remains a favorite of mine  due mostly to fond childhood memories . it  s not a perfect movie  but it definitely deserves another look and perhaps a cult following .  br    br   the story a bunch of low  level superheroes save the day . this was executed again in the mediocre  direct  to  video  the specials  as well . but this is the other end of the spectrum big budget  huge budget  almost     million i think  studio comedy . yes  the effects are overblown and the huge sets and wonderful production design are a bit much considering the plot . but don  t think this as a stupid  special effects  y superhero movie   it  s a parody . they fight a villain named cassanova frankenstein  people . he has a psychofrakulator  whatever that is  it  s a doomsday device  he  ll take over the world  yada yada .  and resident superhero captain amazing  a zapp brannigan  esque greg kinnear  with commercial  product  logos on his costume  nice touch  is kidnapped . time for the mystery men mr . furious  ben stiller  gets mad   the shoveller  william h . macy  beats people with shovels   the blue raja  hank azaria  british  throws forks   the bowler  janeane garafolo  bowls   invisible boy  kel mitchell  guess what he does   the spleen  the great paul reubens  farts   and the sphinx  wes studi  cuts guns in half with his mind  i am not kidding  . the rest of the fantastic cast of character actors includes geoffrey rush as cassanova  lena olin heavily edited out as cassanova  s bride  and the one and only tom waits as a crazy weapons dealer . so . . . with macy  kinnear  olin  and rush there are four oscar  nominees  and one winner  and tom freakin  waits  it  s not perfect though . it  s overlong and there are some gushes of corniness here and there  the shoveller  s full of them  .  br    br   the dialogue definitely outweighs the physical comedy  which is sometimes lacking  there  s a guy who farts for his power  case closed  . the dialogue is definitely a highlight  the cyclical ramblings of the sphinx  the mixed metaphors of mr . furious  etc . it  s downright a funny movie   it will almost make you forget that this was the film that let  all star  by smashmouth out into the world .   br    br   unfortunately  the film did not do as well with critics and audiences as it should have . a sequel was originally planned  the film is in fact based on a comic book and characters from  the flaming carrot  comics . the flaming carrot was planned for the sequel i believe  but this did not do well at the box office . it could have been a hard sell  a superhero comedy with the guy from  there  s something about mary .  it also could have been the fact that it was released on the same day as  the sixth sense    which ended up being the biggest hit for the month of august   as well as  the thomas crown affair .  two other misunderstood classics were released on the same crowded weekend  oddly enough    dick  and  the iron giant .  critics gave mm passable reviews  but it was quickly forgotten . sadly enough  on comedy central  s roast of jerry stiller  comedian jeffrey ross commented to ben stiller that   i saw  mystery men  and i fired my agent .  ben is then seen to mouth the words   i should have to .  don  t listen to him . give  mystery men  a chance .  ,1

i liked boyle  s performance  but that  s about the only positive thing i can say . everything was overdone to the point of absurdity . most of the actors spoke like you would expect your   year  old nephew to speak if he were pretending to be a jaded  stone  hearted cop  or an ultra  evil villain . the raspy voice  overs seemed amateurish to me . i could go buy a cheap synthesizer and crank out better opening music . and what  s with the whole     ish police torture stuff  it was totally superfluous and had nothing to do with the actual events of the story . cox added a lot of things  in fact  that he apparently thought would be really cool  but had nothing to do with the story . that  s a big disappointment because one of the things that makes borges  stories so good is his minimalism   they are tightly bound  with no superfluous details . this movie is just the opposite . i stopped watching after the scene where lonnrot is questioning the guy from the yidische zaitung  or thereabouts . i wasted   renting this  but at least i can get some satisfaction from writing this review and hopefully saving others from making the same mistake .  ,0
i am not going to lie  this is a great movie . i saw it about  months ago at my local theatre . i saw it a second time  and i was somewhat bored in the slow scenes . sid  the sloth  is not all that flattering  but diego  a mountain lion  i think  is really good in the movie . the animation is outstanding  and the story has a touching ending . it is worth taking kids   and under to  but teens would probably find it a tad bit boring . also  the uniqueness in the characters is so interesting . like i said  it is a pretty good movie  but i would rate  toy story   or  shrek  higher .      ,1
this show is so incredibly hilarious that i couldn  t stop watching the marathon on comedy central tonight  despite the fact that i  ve seen all the episodes previously  . i  ve always regarded silverman as a huge talent and this is finally a vehicle for that talent to be enjoyed by a wide audience . i watch this show and i laugh a very large percentage of the time . . . i can  t say that about many tv shows . . . can you  this show is finally something new and interesting and  most importantly  funny  this is a show i will never miss and it is one i will buy on dvd as soon as it comes out . you owe it to yourself to watch this show . . . i predict a long run for this series . . . and just to be clear  the people who are offended by this show just don  t get it . . . perhaps they lack the intelligence to comprehend it . . . they should stop making fools of themselves by attacking something they don  t understand . anyone who uses the word  bigot  in reference to silverman  or who claims that she only aims to  shock  . . . is way off the mark . . . she  s exactly the opposite just google her and you  ll quickly see that she  s a huge proponent of civil rights  etc . if you don  t know that she  s ironically embracing all of these outrageous viewpoints  you don  t get it . and if you don  t get it  do the rest of us a favor and be quiet about it so we can all enjoy the hilarity . . .  ,1
losing control is another offering in the erotic thriller genre which could be considered as the pulp fiction of the film world . usually  they involve a roundabout route to murderous intent  interspersed with copious disrobing . this is not a complaint  especially when it is done by the stunningly beautiful women who invariably inhabit this make  believe world .  br    br   kim ward  kira reed  is suffering a bout of writer  s block . just by chance   or is it   she meets a man  doug jeffery  who engages with her in ever more risky sexual encounters . the man refuses to divulge any information about himself  yet kim steadfastly refuses to stop the affair . her agent  alexa  anneliza scott  thinks it will do wonders for her book sales . as in most films of this type  the denouement comes near the end but some things do not add up . i have seen enough of this kind of film to think  no change there  then  but i like them . they are so undemanding .  br    br   performances of the cast vary . doug jeffery carries the film as the psycho  sociopath you do not want to cross . kira reed looks good but fails to convince as the woman in peril . clay greenbush as the pi did not convince either .  br    br   finally  a note of caution about the dvd under review . both the cover and the disc state r  rated and running time as   minutes but the run time is less than   minutes . this probably explains why the sex scenes appear truncated and why jennifer ludlow  s performance is cut short just as she  s getting started .  stars .  ,0
excellent movie  a realistic picture of contemporary finland  touching and profound . one of the best finnish films ever made . captures marvelously the everyday life in a central finland small town  people  s desires and weaknesses  joys and sorrows . the bright early fall sunshine creates a cool atmosphere to this lucid examination of people in a welfare society . lampela is indeed one of the most promising finnish filmmakers . he shows that it is possible to make gripping movies without machine guns and bloodshed . his next film eila is also worth seeing although the story of cleaning women fighting for their jobs is not quite as universally appealing as the destinies in joki .  ,1

many people know how it feels when a loved one is lost . the feelings of pain  grief and sorrow can be unbearable . however  sometimes it is the memories they leave behind that trigger the saddest emotions . this theme is superbly portrayed in the short film  tulip   directed by the award winning australian actress  rachel griffths . described as a movie  as much about memories as it is about love   a string of sensitivity and sentimentality is expertly threaded into this triumphant   minute film .  br    br    tulip  is a beautifully wrought  touching and heart  warming story of a man  s journey in coming to terms with the loss of his wife through the relationship he shares with a very special animal   tulip  . the film opens with a rising dawn  the chirping of birds and a vast landscape  introducing the sense of rustic harmony present throughout the film . a soft music plays  marking the entrance of ruth  jean bain  . she wears a flowered dress and apron with a sun hat on her head . she gently pets tulip  caressing her ears and patting her back . the furnishing of the house is impressive and the attention to detail is creditable  a vase of tulips can be seen on the bench   reflecting the peaceful rural community . will  charles  bud  tingwell  greets ruth as she is spooning the milk from the bucket . they pour the milk and coffee together  a sign of companionship and teamwork . not a word is said but it is obvious that their relationship is close and affectionate they paint a perfect picture of happiness .  br    br   sadly  happiness doesn  t last forever . the tragic passing of ruth affects will deeply . an effective scene of fading cars highlights will  s isolation and vulnerability at the end of the day of the funeral . soon he sinks into depression and becomes oblivious to his surroundings when everything seems hopeless and lost . at will  s moment of despair  tulip becomes the symbol of ruth  the genuine connection will has with his late wife . it was through tulip that will learns to cope with the absence of ruth and overcome the heartrending feelings of loneliness .  br    br   each of the characters is realistically and solidly portrayed  especially the part of will . charles  bud  tingwell brings the character to life through personal investment . the recent loss of his own wife  audrey tingwell  is effectively reflected in his acting . every sag of his shoulder and every frown on his brow make the viewer empathize strongly with the character . the character of ruth is wonderfully carried out by jean bain . although ruth does not say a single word throughout the movie  her sweet personality and loving relationship with will are obvious . lois ramsey and kati edwards give delightful performances in supporting roles as the friendly margaret and mary . they also add a subtle humor to the bittersweet story .  br    br   an anecdote from griffths  childhood  the story of loss and discovery is remarkably captured in  tulip  . beautifully shot and superbly acted  this film will surely make you misty eyed  triumphant or feel like drinking a cup of milk .  ,1
this post may contain spoilers   br    br   although it was  years after the series ended and wb was currently working on justice league  this animated movie is a welcome addition to the video library . why  well  if mask of the phantasm compliments the first   episodes of batman the animated series and subzero compliments the   episodes of the adventures of batman and robin  then mystery of the batwoman compliments the final   episodes of the gotham knights version of batman . kevin conroy once again delivers a voice over performance that is nothing short of excellence and perfection . i admit i was a bit leery when i heard about batwoman and all i could think about were the old    s comics of batman . but i was blown away by the batwoman character  her look  her costume  which i assumed inspired bruce wayne to create the costume on batman beyond  and the fact that this movie keeps you guessing who batwoman is all the way through . if you want to know who batwoman is  then buy or rent the dvd . barbara gordon makes a cameo appearance and i think the writers were trying to hint that bruce and barbara had something going on between them like they did in batman beyond . tim drake appears as robin  but his role is a small one and sadly  there is no sign of or mention of dick grayson alias nightwing  which leads me to believe he has established himself in bludhaven  his city in the comics  .  br    br   of the three suspects for batwoman  my favorite is kathy duquesne  who looks an awful lot like halle berry . kelly ripa did a great job as one of the other suspects . when it comes to the villains  i  m glad the penguin was one of them  but i did not like the fact that they replaced paul williams with david ogden stiers . pengy just didn  t sound right . same thing goes for robin . the new guy did okay  but just as i was starting to get used to matt valencia  they replaced him . it  s interesting to note that kevin michael richardson  who voices carlton duquesne is now the voice of the joker in  the batman  series . and we finally see what rupert thorne looks like revamped since he didn  t show up in the gotham knights episodes . the late john vernon will be missed . although i enjoyed henry silva as the voice of bane  if he had to be replaced  they got the right man in the form of hector elizondo . i only wish they could have used two face  riddler  or the scary new version of the scarecrow .  br    br   the musical score and especially the soft sounding intro were superb . i wish that was on a soundtrack and i especially enjoyed the beautiful and talented cherie in the iceberg lounge along with her song  betcha neva . while some feel that this movie is weaker than the mask of the phantasm and subzero  i find it just as strong and enjoyable as the rest  plus like i said earlier  it  s a full length movie based off the gotham knights version of batman  which i think gives a good balance . i would at least recommend renting this dvd first before buying it for those who might be leery of this movie  but personally  it  s well worth the purchase . i give mystery of the batwoman a  .  ,1

why is it that when a star reaches the top of the star chain  they ruin all the good work by making a bad movie  burt reynolds peaked  then started making dreadful hal needham car chase flicks . arnold schwarzenegger became the hottest property in hollywood  only to invite derision upon himself with the appalling last action hero . and here  loquacious eddie murphy erases memories of trading places and   hours with this  family  adventure flick  which is an unbelievably tedious  childish and generally plain awful misfire in which the chance to see charlotte lewis  s great big breasts in a tight blouse is the most appealing aspect of the entire film .  br    br   the story is pure humdrum . it concerns social worker murphy  contacted by mysterious types and told that he is the chosen one . chosen for what  i hear you ask . his job is to rescue a tibetan boy with mystical powers from a race of demons who want to rule the world . as the main demon  classy actor charles dance looks terribly embarrassed to be in the film  but hey  i  m sure he was well paid for sacrificing his talents . of all murphy  s films  this is easily the worst . i  ve read some reviews which suggest that it is nice to see murphy in an atypical role  in a non formulaic kind of film  and while both points are loosely true there  s no forgiving the fact that the film  however atypical and non formulaic it might be  is an absolute load of garbage .  br    br    ,0

i have been a fan of without a trace from the premier episode . i really cannot express my disappointment in the episode last week . this is a real problem that far too many afican  american families have dealt with and continue to deal with . the lack of media coverage crucial in the first   hours has been documented by a recent study . law enforcement including local  state  and federal are also complicit . what was the purpose of advertising this subject matter and then copping out on the ending  seemingly  television can deal with almost any subject matter except race . this is shameful . get it together or don  t explore it next time .  ,0
the only reason  the norliss tapes  deserves any stars is the presence of angie dickinson in the cast . other than getting to see angie baby in a pre   police woman  performance  there  s nothing else worth seeing here .  br    br   the synopsis  br    br    minor spoilers   br    br   david norliss is tapped to write a book on the supernatural . one day he mysteriously disappears after phoning his publisher and suggesting he has stumbled across something that has placed him in mortal danger . the entire series for which this miserable pilot was written was apparently intended to be a series of flashbacks via the  norliss tapes    a set of audio tapes the writer recorded while investigating cases of the supernatural .  br    br   in the pilot episode  a wealthy sculptor dies   but not before purchasing an ancient egyptian scarab ring from a local occultist who assures him the bauble will give him immortality after death . we soon discover the ring itself doesn  t grant immortality . instead  it only reanimates the sculptor  s corpse  allowing him to escape his crypt so he can run around town draining pretty girls of all their blood .  br    br   blue  faced  yellow  eyed and growling out arrrghhhhhhs you haven  t heard since you last watched  scooby doo  cartoons  the sculptor attacks his wife  dickinson  one dark night . she escapes and  via a mutual acquaintance  contacts norliss to get his assistance in solving the mystery behind her late husband  s uncanny reappearance on her estate .  br    br   so is this guy a vampire  no . there  s no vampire in this story despite what you may have read or heard . the sculptor doesn  t drink his victims  blood   he collects it . how  don  t know . we only see him attacking  never collecting . why  to fulfill the second part of his bid for immortality . it turns out the reanimated sculptor will only be allowed to live forever if he builds a life  size statue of a demon named sargoth out of a mixture of clay and human blood . once it  s finished  sargoth plans to inhabit the statue  using it as his gateway into our world .  br    br   the final analysis  br    br    the norliss tapes  wasn  t picked up as a series for a very good reason . . . it was garbage . as you can see from my synopsis  the story is a paltry  ill  conceived mess . the acting and dialogue offer no better . this isn  t even a contender for a  so bad it  s good  award . sometimes bad is just bad .  br    br   after years of hearing underground rumblings about the great merits of  the norliss tapes   i was very excited to find it airing on fox movie channel on         . i wish i hadn  t set myself up for the fall .  br    br   having screened this groaner for the first time two days ago  i can only assume any applause you  ve heard so far from other imdb reviewers is coming from those who are reviewing the show based on dim memories and the nostalgia of youth . or perhaps they are simply loyal fans of dan curtis . either way  they  ve offered you misleading reviews of  the norliss tapes .   br    br   pauly orchid   october         ,0
edwin porter  s     short film entitled  the great train robbery  bursts onto the screen with so much excitement and ingenuity that one prepares to be blown away by another pioneering early film . just like melies   a trip to the moon   critics have hailed this as being the film that introduced the western genre into modern cinema . in my eyes  they were right . it had everything from the planning  the actual heist of the train  the murder of an unwanted civilian  and that looming final scene that makes you realize that these villains mean business  it was all monumental for its time . from here to eastwood  every western filmmaker has used porter  s image in some form or another to create their own story . one cannot say that this film didn  t open the door  but the struggle comes from the story itself . the genre was defined by porter  but outside of its initial excitement  there really isn  t anything to grapple onto . perhaps i am jaded by the clich modern westerns and their haphazard messages  but how can something be clich before being clich  to me   the great train robbery  seemed forced  untraceable  and unsurprising .  br    br   unlike melies  porter tells a very linear story . robbers change the course of a train  rob it  then shoot at random people just to prove they are the true villains  and the final scene ends like any predestined film  without any surprises or glitches  and that looming man with a gun to your proverbial face . it is bland . porter  s film is boring . in the edition i watched  there was an addition of color near to the end to emphasize emotion  which felt cheap and was not encouraging to the filmmaker  or to the viewer . the issue remains that while it is important  porter  s film has been borrowed time and time again  it has in effect become diluted . the story itself does not carry the emotional powerhouse it once has . unlike melies early film  i cannot watch this again . i know what has happened  i know there is very little missing from behind the scenes  and that finally it is just what it has set out to be  a simple story leading from point a to point b to point c . this issue is not only my gripe with this film  but also the strongest element to see in such an early film . while it was dull  the fact that it told such a strong narrative  that our characters were characters with motives and drives  was outstanding to see . in an era where nonfiction films seemed mainstream  this broke the mold . again  not that i am jumping on the prophetic bandwagon about this film  it is an important film  it just isn  t a great film .  br    br   overall  i was eager to jump into this film to see where the roots of the western genre were planted  but i was equally as happy to leave this film behind . porter is a talented director  and g . m . anderson obviously went on to be very successful in the created field  but i just wasn  t in awe of the film . i wasn  t expecting big budget effects like melies work  nor was i expecting a duplicate of  a trip to the moon   but i did want to see the same creativity  exploration  and originality . i felt porter played it safe  if that can be said with such an early film  but i couldn  t feel the excitement as our villains did their evil deeds . i wasn  t rooting for anyone  and the final conclusion proved that the kitschy  ness of it had worn off minutes after the film started . it was pioneering  but not monumental .  the great train robbery  has lost its space in the time capsule of cinema .  br    br   grade  out of   ,0
in paris  the shy and insecure bureaucrat trelkovsky  roman polanski  rents an old apartment without bathroom where the previous tenant  the egyptologist simone choule  dominique poulange   committed suicide . the unfriendly concierge  shelley winters  and the tough landlord mr . zy  melvyn douglas  establish stringent rules of behavior and trekovsky feels ridden by his neighbors . meanwhile he visits simone in the hospital and befriends her girlfriend stella  isabelle adjani  . after the death of simone  trekovsky feels obsessed for her and believes his landlord and neighbors are plotting a scheme to force him to also commit suicide .  br    br   the weird  le locataire  is a disturbing and creepy tale of paranoia and delusion . the story and the process of madness and loss of identity of the lonely trelkovsky are slowly developed in a nightmarish atmosphere in the gruesome location of his apartment  and what is happening indeed is totally unpredictable . the performances are awesome and isabelle adjani is extremely beautiful . my vote is eight .  br    br   title  brazil    o inquilino    the tenant    ,1
the great caruso displays the unique talents of mario lanza . he shows great acting capacity and is in top form as a lyrical singer  paired with dorothy kirsten  soprano of the metropolitan opera . indeed  i dare to say that he performs some songs better than caruso  check a  vuchella from tosti and la danza from rossini  . the mgm art and music departments also did a good job . this movie could be perfect  were it not for the awkward presence of ann blyth we see that she is trying her best  dressed in the fifties style in scenes just before      unforgivable . lanza deserved a better leading lady  and blyth should stick to less demanding productions . also notice that ms . kirsten sings most of the opera duets of the film with lanza  giving the wrong notion that caruso had a kind of permanent leading soprano .  ,1
there are few comedies like this  where almost every line and every character come close to flawless . this is soooo funny   and it has quite a bit of satire there to . sally field is heading the field of truly outstanding actors and does a good  if not perfect  job with her daytime tv  diva . sometimes her acting is just a little to broad and over the top  but    of the time she is a riot  in the same league is kevin kline  robert downey jr and whoopy goldberg  who unfortunately has too little to do here  . downey jr may not convince entirely as a comedian and has not the timing right all the time  but he struggles with his part which is  to be honest  the most ungrateful one . but the shining star here is cathy moriarty as celeste  a true bitch if there ever was one with more than one nasty secret  you will see in the absolutely stunning finale   . sadly elisabeth shue never seems to be quite comfortable in her part . i normally like ms shue  but here she acts as a fish out of water and sometimes seems to be in a different movie . but it is not something damaging and for the most part she is at least adequate . otherwise  brimming with memorable lines and situations  this is a comedy to watch whenever it is on tv or wherever .  ,1
to start off with  since this movie is a remake of a classic  the rating has to be lowered already . since this version stars viggo mortensen in the lead role of kowalski  it helps .  br    br   isn  t this just like the united states government though  to terrorize one of its own citizens . sounds like jason priestley  s character from the movie  but it is the truth  the government would do anything possible to destroy a man  s life for trying to get home to his wife . a wife  who is in labor no less  and may not make it .  br    br    there was a time in this country that the police would escort a man to his pregnant wife .  the words of the disc jockey .  br    br   there were some great shots of scenery in this film  and great car chases and a lot of spirituality . after much consideration  i gave this film a  .  ,1

  the italian  is among the great or near  great films of     that are available today . the year was a turning point for the feature  length film  especially in america lois weber  s  hypocrites   cecil b . demille  s  the cheat  and  of course  d . w . griffith  s  the birth of a nation  set new benchmarks for the art . additionally  that year  russian filmmaker yevgeni bauer made two of his best pictures   after death  and  daydreams  . the french serial  les vampires  also has its admirers today  although i disagree with them . the emergence of the feature  length film was led by europe  mainly denmark  france and italy  but dominance of this market and  to a degree  the art shifted to across the atlantic in     .  br    br   the most overriding artistic achievement of  the italian  is its stunning and often innovative cinematography . there are some picturesque sunsets  mobile framing  including a brief overhead angled shot of the italian racing to buy a wedding ring and another shot of him holding onto a moving car  and  in general  there is wise use of varied camera angles and expert lighting throughout . an especially amazing shot is a close  up of the italian enraged as he slowly approaches the camera for an extreme close  up  in reference to d . w . griffith  s  musketeers of pig alley        . he  s so enraged his environment even begins to shake around his anger .  br    br   unfortunately  the cinematographer appears to be unknown . the director  although originally without credit in the film  is now known to have been reginald barker . five or so of his other films made for ince are also available today  but are rather unremarkable .  civilization         which he worked on  was a large production  but a deeply flawed movie . by the way  i  d guess that one or more of the various cinematographers who worked on  civilization  also photographed  the italian  .  br    br   moreover  the entire production is very advanced for then . venice and new york are well rendered despite the film being shot in los angeles  for romanticized venice  and san francisco  for the ethnic slums of new york  . there are extensive flashbacks  although perhaps one or two too many . i especially like the clever framing of the narrative as being read in a book by a character played by the same actor  george beban  who is also the lead in the inner  main narrative . the reading of the story is further briefly framed by the opening at the beginning and closing at the end of curtain drapes   la the theatre  which is reflected within the inner story during the revenge climax in the child  s room  with the opening and closing of window curtains . parallel editing  in  camera dissolves and irises and such are handled expertly . additionally  beban and clara williams  as his wife  play their parts well .  br    br   on the other hand   the italian  does have a few drawbacks . the film  s early moments of comedy clash rather disharmoniously with the latter parts of harsh and heavy melodrama  although the environmental changes from romanticized italy to naturalistic new york works wellmostly because it  s supported by the lighting and photography . the harsh dissolution of the american dream in this film  enhanced by the stark photography  must have been poignant to the immigrant classes who comprised a disproportionately large population of the movie  going public back then . the corrigan character should have been foreshadowed more his brief introduction campaigning for another politician seems inadequate for his later centrality to the italian  s revenge . in addition  the filmmakers were either medically naf or careless to not explain the lack of breastfeeding of the infant and the unwarranted faith in the healing powers of quietness for the other child . aside from the deficiencies in plot   the italian  is exceptionally well made .  ,1
for the life of me i can  t understand the good reviews on this piece of crap . it was pointless . matthew modine was horribly miscast as a leading ladies man . gina gershon  well  others have said it  but i  ll reiterate  why the stupid accent  totally unnecessary . and her acting was just bad . i don  t know if she was thrown by the accent  or what . there was no chemistry between these two .  br    br   and the girl modine was in love with  suddenly she  s shoving half a head of lettuce in her mouth and acting in a goofy way  where did that come from  i think we were supposed to feel sorry for her as we saw her marriage to a workaholic begin to crumble  but frankly  i couldn  t care less about any of these people .  ,0
this movie about two italian brothers who came to germany with their family is just great   br    br   it isn  t an idealistic movie  i would say it shows life as it is or was in the   s and   s when the main story takes place . the characters are very nice but have also some  dark  sides  what makes you believe that these are real persons . great movie with great actors to show that life is not funny all the time  but that you can find happiness with  fire and passion  as the main character gigi would say .  ,1
when i caught a glimpse of the title i thought are we going to get another try  hard hip slasher  but actually i found   eventy  ive  to be a mildly passable  and almost   s throwback after a tediously slow mid  section it picks up momentum for the final half  hour leading to it  s outrageously tacky climax and downright cop out ending . it won  t win awards for originality  because it  s as systematic as you can get and steals its thunder in the way of thrills  usual cheap jump scares   location  secluded mansion  and motivation from other films . the gleaming direction is by  the  book and the material is quite hackneyed with poorly realised red herrings within its elaborate plotting and flimsy script . sometimes laughable  but nonetheless i was entertained mainly due to its brutal and grisly acts of pulpy violence towards some rather obnoxiously annoying college students by a psychotic killer with a battle axe . the performances weren  t bad in the shape of a spunky young cast  however the characters they were portraying weren  t particularly enticing . an always presentable rutger hauer shows up in a short supportive role as a grizzled detective . a slickly made  but a shallow and forgettable addition to the fold .  ,0
the movie has very much the feel of a play right from the start  i think it would make a better play than a movie because the set and dramatization make a movie version seem a bit too artificial . but  still  it  s carried out fairly well  and the story  especially the dialogue are interesting . they  ve taken the dialogue pretty much exactly as is from the actual play . perhaps it  s a good introduction to shaw  s plays .  br    br   the main character raina has her head in the clouds  and a flair for the dramatic  and helena bonham carter  s acting does a good job here . her fianc  serges  is a bit too cartoonish when he is really supposed to be an extremely handsome dashing figure . her parents are entertaining enough .  ,1
i went looking for this movie in typical fan obsession . i just wanted to check it out . i was not expecting much of anything . after all  a musician  an actor and a screenplay writer  not possible for so much talent to reside in one person . right    br    br   wrong   obsession aside  it quickly became one of my favorites  the story line and characters are not lost in the typical hyped up hollywood special effects . the story plucks at your emotions and pulls you along . as the credits roll by  you suddenly realize you were glued until the end .  br    br   at times  the acting seems a little over the top . i do  however  believe it  s done with comedic intent and very fitting of the character . otherwise  i wouldn  t have expected the level of acting witnessed .  br    br   it  s worth seeing more than once . i find myself laughing hysterically or gasping unexpectedly over something i either missed or forgot about the first time or two around .  br    br   i completely recommend this movie . feel free to go in with your doubts  but i  m sure it will find a place on your shelf .  ,1

how many centuries will pass until the japanese  asian horror films abandon the long  haired ghost  woman shtick  admittedly  they  ve managed to rip off  ringu  a million times  and often it worked well  which just goes to show that originality isn  t that much of a requirement in the horror genre  or that i  m very uncritical and easy to please   . however  this time around i found myself a little restless  somewhat bored . it  s not a bad film  but it  s at least half  an  hour longer than it should be  with its absurd    minutes length . compared to many other japanese horror films  omc lacks atmosphere and excitement . plus  the ending is confusing it makes no sense at all . as for the ring  tone miike could have come up with a melody that is more effective than that forgettable little thing . even though it was played a dozen times i can  t even remember it  that  s how scary it was . speaking of miike  for him this is something of a commercial venture  so if anyone thinks they might be getting perversion of the  bijita q  or  audition  kind  they  re wasting their time .  ,0

for what it is   raising victor vargas  is about as close to perfection as a film can get . either sheer genius from a fledgling auteur or just one of those lucky mixes where everything clicked  probably some of each   this simple little slice  of  urban  life ethnic first love flick fleshes out its young characters with such depth you can almost read their minds . the film begins with a strong flavor of  street  but works its way into a latino family affair and then focuses on a story which speaks volumes about the uncertainty of youth and the profoundly natural desire to love another . in my experience  never has so much been done with so little  cast of tyros  novice director  etc .  . praised by the critics but not for everyone   raising victor vargas  is recommended for indie lovers and realists into simple tales rich in humanness .  a   ,1
why hollywood feels the need to remake movies that were so brilliant their prime  the texas chainsaw massacre  the hills have eyes  but is it considerably worse why hollywood feels the need to remake those horror films that weren  t brilliant to start with  prom night  the amityville horror  much like their originals these remakes fail in creating atmosphere  character or any genuine scares at all . prom night is so flat and uninteresting its hard to watch  but for all the wrong reasons .  br    br   it  s a poorly acted  massively uninteresting and ultimately dull excursion that fails at everything its designed to do . it  s clear hollywood horror is dead . even the likes of the hills have eyes and the texas chainsaw massacre managed to ruin their franchises in style with buckets of blood and a decent plot . prom night is virtually bloodless and i  m not even going to mention how bad the plot is . its inability to seal the killers identify makes this the least suspenseful horror movie since erm . . . the original .  br    br   one of the most notorious slasher films of the     s returns to terrorize filmgoers with this remake that proves just how horrifying high school dances can truly be . donna keppel  brittany snow  has survived a terrible tragedy  but now the time has come to leave the past behind and celebrate her senior prom in style .  br    br   when the big night finally arrives  donna and her best friends prepare to enjoy their last big high  school blowout by living it up and partying till dawn . but while donna is willing to look past her nightmares and into a brighter future  the man she thought she had escaped forever has returned for one last dance . an obsessed killer is on the loose  and he  ll slay anyone who attempts to prevent him from reaching his one and only donna .  br    br   who will survive to see graduation day  and what will donna do when she  s forced to confront her greatest fear  scott porter  jessica stroup  and dana davis co  star in the slasher remake that will have tuxedo  clad teens everywhere nervously looking over their shoulders as they file out onto the dance floor . a plot that will probably put you off going to see this . witch if you ask me is a good thing .  br    br   without much to work with  mccormick gamely tries to milk tension out of the most banal of situations . at one point  a girl backs into a floor lamp  a lamp   and mccormick tries to pump it up into a jump  scare moment . desperate times really do call for desperate measures . there haven  t been this many shots of closets since the last ikea catalogue .  br    br   in the era of the hills  my super sweet   and to catch a predator  there probably is a freaky  scary movie to be mined from the commoditisation of glamour and society  s creepy obsession with youthful beauty . this is not that movie .  br    br   my final verdict  avoid at all cost . nobody will like prom night  it  s even a disappointment to thoses who usually enjoy hack  job remakes . considering its absolute lack of blood or frights . a night you  ll be in a hurry to forget .  ,0
just watched it on sky tv missed the first half an hour . i did wonder if it was a true story so watched it to the end . there was no brief at the end to say what happened to everyone . it did remind me of speed but at the end of the day i don  t suppose it was released at the cinema as we did see the following error . the goof that we saw was that they remove the bonnet  hood  and then later on there are two shots of the car with the police car in front trying to slow it down when the bonnet is back on . it did have me on the edge of my seat especially when i thought the baby was going to hit the bridge and of course when the bridge wasn  t going to be lowered and then it was . i  m afraid i did burst into tears so it wasn  t that bad      ,1
after hearing raves about this movie for years  i finally decided to rent it and watch . let me start by saying that i  m glad that the rental was free from the local library . this move was slow  boring  unrealistic and the plot made no sense . after  hours  i was ready to nuke that backwater texas town and put the group of those characters out of their misery . i realize that taste is subjective  but believe me  i just do not understand all of the hype that i have heard about this movie . dallas provided as good a detail of the life in texas as this movie . rent it only if you want to understand how movie studios can pay enough money to reviewers to convince the general public that a bad movie is good .  ,0
this incredibly formulaic flick from the  walker  texas ranger  squad contains some of the most unbelievable scenes ever witnessed within a tv movie . in addition  one can pretty much predict the outcome from the get  go . however  it  s a fun little movie that gets the job done it entertains . that  s all it was meant to do and it does so . the stunts and explosions are fun and exciting and the plot isn  t half bad . the acting is also decent  which isn  t much of a surprise  because everyone knows that chuck norris is no steven seagal . if you  re a fan of the genre  and of  walker  texas ranger    you will definitely love this . if not  then don  t waste your time .      ,1
i  m not sure it was the language or the poor acting  but everything about this movie feels and looks cheap and fake .  br    br   after seeing der untergang this is a huge disappointment . there  s no connection between different scenes  and the acting is so incredibly poor i couldn  t even believe people could make such a mess of something that had great potential .  br    br   and above all  everyone in germany speaks english . big mistake . the german language has a certain sound to it  and especially hitler himself only sounds like hitler when he  s speaking  yelling german .  br    br   the way the story is told made me believe it was improvised on the spot  the characters were empty and the movie seems to be a collection of random events that could have happened .  br    br   whether it  s the english or the fact that i  ve already seen der untergang  everything about this movie was fake and ridiculous .  ,0
deeply humorous yet honest comedy about a bunch of grownups  bill paxton  julie warner  kevin pollak  elizabeth perkins  vincent spano  matt craven  and diane lane  who are invited back to spend a week to tomawka  a camp in  ontario  canada by their former consuelor  alan arkin  . writer  director mike binder drew upon his experience at the same camp as the main source of creating a gentle and understanding yarn that makes sense . also  the movie has plenty of funny moments  some of which are completely bizarre like my favorite  the one involves using masking tape . newton thomas sigel   the usual suspects    three kings   provides the film with some impressive shots of the canadian wilderness . among the cast  sam raimi  director of  the evil dead  films and  the gift   appears here as arkin  s bumbling right  hand man . one more thing  this film reassured me that a camp doesn  t have to be a site of bloody murders .  ,1
this is a more interesting than usual porn movie  because it is a fantasy adventure . the production values are high and the acting is  believe it or not  pretty good  especially jenna jameson . its also in widescreen which helps  it gives a feeling of a real motion picture and not a porn movie . but  of course it is a porn and a really good one with nice costumes  fine atmosphere and scenery . and by the way  the sex is hot .  br    br   watch out for this one . . .  ,1

i just watched the movie i was afraid it  s gonna disappoint me . i was rather surprised at the end though . the american pie franchise is still in my favorite franchise movies of all times . yes  it won  t be true if i say that i enjoyed it as mush as i enjoyed the original ones . beta house along with the previous two pies definitely lost something that the first two pies had . it is not gonna become a classic as the first two already did . but what the hell  it is still funny with a lot of good moments and i think it should be the first movie to pick if you wanna have fun and relax after a hard day at work or school . beta house deserves     but i gave it     just for being another slice of pie .  ,1

ok  let me again admit that i haven  t seen any other merchant ivory  the distributor  films . nor have i seen more celebrated works by the director  so my capacity to discuss before the rains outside of analysis of the film itself is mitigated . with that admittance  let me begin .  br    br   before the rains is a different kind of movie that doesn  t know which genre it wants to be . at first  it pretends to be a romance . in most romances  the protagonist falls in love with a supporting character  is separated from the supporting character  and is  sometimes  united with his or her partner . this movie  s hero has already won the heart of his lover but cannot be with her . his name is henry moores and her name is sajani  and they reside in southern india during the waning days of the raj  british imperial rule  . henry has been away from london for a long time and has fallen in love with his married indian maid  despite his legal marriage and child overseas . what could be better than that  they often sneak away for intimate afternoons until some children notice them . word spreads to sajani  s husband who questions her involvement with moores . she denies any contact with him  but moores asks her to leave the area . sajani refuses because of her devotion to him and commits suicide . please take note that these events occur in the opening third of the film . the film changes tone and becomes a crime  drama in its final portions .  br    br   sajani  s body is discovered right as moores  family comes to visit . the alleged perpetrator is moores  s english  educated assistant t . k . t . k . knows of his master  s affair but keeps silent until his life becomes threatened . once he is declared innocent  he attempts to regain his honor by killing moores . t . k . is too squeamish and leaves him in a dirt path as the rains fall .  br    br   i want to warn you  this isn  t a romance film . the dvd cover and theatrical posters show an indian woman and caucasian man embracing in an idealized tropic setting . this image is captured directly from the film  s opening  but quickly disappears . then it  s over . it seems like an effort to capitalize on western fixation on forbidden love . it isn  t effective  at all . not only is the movie not a romance  but its characters lack any personality . they are bundles of walking clichs . moores is an arrogant white man who doesn  t recognize his indian friend  t . k .  s intelligence . t . k . is torn between his own heritage and his educative background . sajani is a woman incapable of having a choice in her romantic life . oh  and  of course  moores  family is inquisitive into sajani  s death but still slightly racist to indians . if the tone wasn  t so serious  i would be willing to overlook these problems  but it isn  t . the film is presented with a didactic overtone which highlights its poor character development .  br    br   no  this film isn  t terrible . other than the laughable screenplay  it isn  t poor . the actors are all experienced and perform well here . nandita das  who plays sajani  was part of wonderful indian drama water . even director sivan has an impressive resume . he recently oversaw the terrorist  which is part of roger ebert  s  great movies  collection . what happened here  why is this movie so bad  well  sivan mentioned how he was inspired to direct this film because of a short he viewed in israel called red roofs . apparently  the story was  timeless   and sivan sought to create a similar experience set in      s india . i don  t have any problem with that approach  but i think sivan may have been too motivated this time . the actors  cinematography  and set design are acceptable but unless you share sivan  s aura  you  ll probably not enjoy it . my recommendation is that you presume you aren  t in accordance with him and watch something else . final consensus and  out of   ,0
the movie looked like a walk  through for  immoral study  . most likely i never got much involved with the burning need of the female artist to immortalize male nudes and thus all that fuss about  now  who drew this penis    sounded a bit gratuitous . dialogues in this movie are rather dreadful  albeit visually this movie got its moments . i almost dig it when tassi got into painting a mental picture but then movie weered back onto penises . highly recommended to those who has not seen one in a while .  ,1
first off  i  m a huge fan of   s movies  and of jennifer conelly as well . so yesterday  i wandered into a local used book  movie store and found a vhs copy . i read the back and it sounded good and for   .    it was a good deal . so i took it home and popped it in the vcr . what a sweet movie  at my age now  i relate more to movies like about last night or st . elmo  s fire  but still i remember what it was like to be      and in love with an older guy  etc . we all have those little crushes when we  re younger . and if it doesn  t work out  we  re heartbroken and we think that we  ll never get over it . but of course we do . many times . it  s that sort of sweet quality that i really got from this movie . the feeling of  oooh  i remember when something like that happened to me . . .  is all through it . the characters are interesting and well  developed . i recommend it to anyone who likes   s movies  teen films in particular  or to anyone who just wants to go back and remember a simpler time in their lives .  ,1
as a great admirer of marlene dietrich  i had to  finally  watch this very  very dull picture . it is miss dietrich  s first color film  and the world  s most beautiful blond is a redhead  bad start . the story is a tremendous bore  involving a subject which itself bores bores me stiff religious guilt .  who needs it     suffice it to say  perhaps  that of all dietrich  s films  and i have seen most  including  pittsburgh   this is the only one where even her performance is barely worth watching . the color photography is ok  this is a very early technicolor release   but to no purpose . ridiculous casting c . aubrey smith  basil rathbone  enough said   . the only thing of any interest at all is john carradine  s outlandish caricature of a performance as  the sand diviner   who foretells all that will happen . the supposed  happy ending  is one of the most depressing ever conceived . yet another example of david o . selznick  s highly inflated reputation  did he ever make a really good film    other than that one   and  for one final annoyance  the soundtrack of the mgm dvd is a mess  with volume levels seemingly randomized . highly unrecommended .  ,0
hmmmm  want a little romance with your mystery  this has it . i think if the romance was ditched this would have made for a better movie . but how could the romance be ditched when the story  s borrowed from something called a harlequin romance novel  whatever the heck that is . had the romance been ditched  the story might have been a little too weak . the mystery here wasn  t too bad  quite interesting but nothing on the level of mission impossible international espionage . oh well . i thought mel harris was pretty good her short skirts  i think  added some sex appeal . . . but this rob stewart guy probably could have been better cast  maybe with a more well known tv movie actor . the directing was decent and the writing could have been improved on  both could have been a little edgier  a little darker  more adventurous . one thing that was great about this was the use of real european locations . that could easily have been changed so this could have been filmed in canada but they really were in magnificently beautiful places like budapest . possibly a drawback was the director and  or cinematographer  s choice to frame certain shots picture postcard perfect . not good . had this been a more dramatic motion picture shot for the big screen  picture postcard perfect scenes really need to take a backseat and just be a nice part of the background . this was just a tv  movie  though  so they had to add some ummmph to the picture and some of that ummmph came from the scenery . overall  twasn  t really a bad movie . i  ll tell you what  this was absolutely the best canadian  hungarian production i have ever seen   and the only that i know of .  i hereby proclaim this to be a mediocre made  for  tv movie  giving it a grade of c   ,1
i loved this show when it aired on television and was crushed when i found out that someone somewhere decided that it wasn  t worthy of being continued  for years i hung onto my copies of this show  ones that i had taped or had someone tape for me . that is until now . the powers that be finally decided to release this beautiful series on dvd and i finally was able to get my eager little hands on the complete set . which  brings me to this part the part about that this show is all about .  br    br   american gothic is about good verses evil  basically a struggle between lucas buck  that is buck  with a b  . he is an evil sheriff of a south carolina small town that runs things the way he wants things to be ran and stops at nothing to get his way .  br    br   i felt the show was wonderfully written and directed and had lots of life left yet to be lived . i really hated when it was canceled  but that is the way it seems to go for me when i finally find something worth watching on television .  br    br   gary cole did a great job as the role of sheriff lucas buck  he has just the right amount of charm verses evil to pull it off . the other actors did a super job as well  so i guess you could say  even the casting was a hit with me .  ,1
this movie is humorous  charming  and easily becomes a favorite for those who enjoy light entertainment . hollywood is hardly the place for serious history lessons so i simply accept it as is . bing  in his usual inimitable style  performs quite well as the blacksmith  hank martin  who by accident is transported back to another age  the time of king arthur . the beautiful rhonda fleming is breathtaking as alisande  or sandy  the object of hank  s affections although she is betrothed to the brave and formidable sir lancelot  played by henry wilcoxon .  br    br   i just love that episode when king arthur  cedric hardwicke   sir sagramore  wm . bendix   and hank  bing crosby  dress up in tattered clothing and take to the high road with their knapsacks to experience the kingdom at firsthand . king arthur  s comment   i say  we are not alone  while giving his scruffy garments a good scratch  is one of those hilarious moments in the film . william bendix  s portrayal is superbly ridiculous  not to mention his attempts at quaint  ye olde english .   br    br   the story is not deep but it  s well done in my opinion and i enjoy it more each time i see it . it  s great family entertainment too .  br    br    ,1
immediately after renting and watching this movie several years ago  a friend and i decided that it defined the absolute zero on the movie scale . there was nothing about the movie that could have been done worse than it was . to this day we still rate movies  even very bad ones  by how much better than  the lonely lady  they are .  br    br   a long time ago i saw an interview with eleanor perry  who wrote the screenplays for  among other things   last summer  and  diary of a mad housewife   and she related that she had been asked to write a screenplay for the harold robbins  book  the lonely lady .  she said that she sent in a treatment and it was rejected because they didn  t think she understood the difficulties of a female screenwriter in hollywood . she then said  i think they got someone else to write it .  the interview was filmed before the movie was released . she died in      and i bet the first thing she did on arrival in heaven was personally thank god for saving her from involvement in the result .  ,0
as far as i know the real guy that the main actor is playing saw his performance and said it was an outstanding portrayal  i  d agree with him . this is a fantastic film about a quite gifted boy  man with a special body part helping him . oscar and bafta winning  and golden globe nominated daniel day  lewis plays christy browna crippled man with cerebral palsy who spends most of his life on the floor  in a wheelchair and carried by his family . he has a special left foot though  he can write with it  paint with it and hold things with it . he learns to speak later in the film  it is very good for a guy like him . also starring home alone   s oscar winning  and golden globe nominated brenda fricker as mrs . brown and bafta winning ray mcanally as mr . brown . it was nominated the oscars for best director for jim sheridan  best writing  screenplay based on material from another medium and best picture  it was nominated the baftas for best film  best make up artist and best adapted screenplay . daniel day  lewis was number   on the    greatest movie stars  he was number   on the   greatest british actors  he was number  on britain  s finest actors  and he was number   on the world  s greatest actor  and the film was number   on the   greatest british films . outstanding   ,1
while the premise of the film is pretty lame  ollie is diagnosed with  hornophobia    the film is an amiable and enjoyable little flick . it  s also a darn bit better than the films they went on to make after this one   probably since this was the last hal roach  produced laurel and hardy film . in fact  it wouldn  t be a bad idea not to see any of their latter films  as the entire chemistry is lost in these films and the boys play their parts purely for pathos   something true laurel and hardy films never would do . they had a bit of an edge that all the later films lack .  br    br   stan and ollie work at a horn factory . this sounds pretty funny  but it isn  t . not surprisingly with all the racket  ollie is about to have a nervous breakdown and must take some time off work . the doctor  james finlayson   in his last film with the team  recommends an ocean voyage . however  they don  t like sailing and stan has an idea of just renting a boat tied to the dock   then they can get all the sea air they want without all the bother  once they are on the boat  a dangerous escaped criminal boards the boat and they all accidentally set out to sea . fortunately  this portion of the film actually was well  paced and the very end worked out very well .  br    br   while not a great full  length laurel and hardy film  it was much better than many of them since it had no annoying and distracting musical numbers  like in the devil  s brother or babes in toyland  . additionally  there is still a decent amount of physical comedy   something you would see almost none of after this film . part of this was due to the boys  declining health  and ollie  s increasing girth  and part of it was due to the overall insipidness of these later films .  ,1
i wanted to like this movie . but it falls apart in the middle . the whole premise is a good one and ties up nicely  but the middle runs off tangent . the people i watched with were getting annoyed while it ran off course  and hoping it would end sooner than it did . another person actually fell asleep during the middle segment  i found myself day dreaming elsewhere during the schtick parts that had nothing to do with the plot . i bought it for the eye candy and it delivered that well  but it lacks pixar  s writing and soul . i think kids  and under will enjoy the ride at face vaule  while missing the plot . people old enough to follow a plot will find it wonders too far to return quickly and easily . edit out most of the middle section  make it   minutes and it would be a solid flick . i wish i had better things to say . but i don  t  ,0

aside from a few titles and the new sherlock holmes movie  i think i  ve watched every movie guy ritchie has directed . twice . needless to say  i  m a big fan and revolver is one of the highlighted reasons why . this movie is a very different approach from ritchie  when you look at it comparatively with lock  stock . . . and snatch . revolver sets us up for a psychological thriller of sorts as a gambling con finds himself at the mercy of a set of foes he didn  t expect and a guided walk for redemption that he didn  t know he needed . along with seeing andr benjamin of outkast fame strut his acting ability  other standout acts are ray liotta playing the maniacal mr . d  macha and mark strong playing sorter  the hit  man .  br    br   after being sent to prison by a tyrannous casino owner  macha  jake uses his time in solitary to finesse a plot to humiliate macha and force his hand in compensating him for the seven years he spent . when he wins a card game and amasses a decent sum from macha  jake finds himself on the brink of death as he collapses and is diagnosed with an incurable disease that  s left him with three days to live . a team of loan sharks  however  have an answer for him and a ticket to life  only if he gives them all the money he has and relents to working for them  all in a ploy to both take macha down and show jake how dangerous he has made himself to himself . along with having the air of death loom  and a pair of loan sharks having a field day with his money  jake also has to deal with having a hit put out on him  which introduces sorter  a hit  man under macha  s employ . the depth with the story comes when jake realizes that some co  convicts he spent time with in solitary may very  well be the loan shark team out to take him for all he has by crafting all of the unfortunate events that jake seems to find his way into . when faced with this reality though  zack  vincent pastore  and avi show jake just how twisted he has become from being in solitary  having only the company of his mind and his ego then makes it so that their actual existence is elusive even to jake . the movie unravels to a humbling process for both jake and macha as they both come to grips with their inner demons .  br    br   the style of the movie is top  notch as you get the gritty feel of the crime world represented and the characters it includes . although a lot of nods at ritchie  s previous films are here it still has a presence of its own from the dialogue  the sets and the experimental take on the gangster genre . it  s also a great trip on humility and recognizing when you can easily let your ego or a preset notion mask you ability to accomplish what you want or overcome what you should . the characters are well crafted in this movie with all sides being fleshed out and  true to ritchie fashion  they  re all tied in by some underhandedness that throws a wrench in everyone  s affairs . i could and would like to go on about this film and its unique nuances but i don  t want to take too much away from it if you haven  t seen it yet .  br    br   it may take a few sittings to get through all the intricate layers but it  s a great movie and it should be seen . if you  re lucky and you haven  t seen the watered  down us release  see if you can get the original uk version as it will make for a great discussion piece among friends as you try to puzzle in your take . i saw it with my crew around early      and we  re still talking about it with little things we  ve picked up on today . it has garnered its cult status  and it  s well  deserved as the film where ritchie stepped out the box and broke his norm a bit .  br    br   standout line  fear or revere me  but please  think i  m special . we share an addiction . we  re approval junkies .   ,1

antonio margheriti  s  danza macabra  aka .  castle of blood  of     is a beautiful and incredibly haunting masterpiece of italian gothic horror  and after mario bava  s  la maschera del demonio   aka .  black sunday   of     and roger corman  s  pit and the pendulum  of      starring the great vincent price  another must  see that earned the wonderful barbara steele her more than deserved fame as the most important female horror icon in the history of motion pictures . but not only is the beautiful and brilliant barbara steele one of my favorite actresses of all  time  the screenplay to  danza macabra  was co  written by no one less than the cinematic genius sergio corbucci  who directed such ingenious spaghetti western milestones as  django        and  the great silence        . italy  s number  in the field  right after mario bava   director antonio margheriti is one of the all  time masters of gothic horror  and  castle of blood  is doubtlessly his greatest achievement . hardly another film works so brilliantly in creating an incredibly haunting  yet beautiful atmosphere as it is the case with this creepy masterpiece .  br    br   when he encounters the famous writer of brilliant macabre stories  edgar allen poe  in a gloomy london tavern  young journalist alan foster  georges rivire  accepts a bet from a nobleman  that he can not spend a night in his haunted castle in the night of all souls  eve . as soon as foster enters the eerie castle  mysterious things start to happen . after a little while  however  he encounters an enchanting resident of the castle  the stunningly beautiful elisabeth blackwood  barbara steele  . the mysterious events so far  however  have only been forebodings of the terrors the castle bears  however . . .  br    br   the eerie castle setting alone would be sufficient to create a gloomy mood  the excellent black and white cinematography and a great score by riz ortolani create an incredibly haunting atmosphere that is eerie beyond comparison . the wonderful barbara steele is fantastic as always  i simply can not find enough words to praise this wonderful actress . no other actress has ever been capable of uniting ravishing beauty with the uncanny as it is the case with steele  and no actress ever will . besides steele  the movie  s cast contains another stunning beauty  margarete robsahm  and she also delivers a great performance . george rivire  s performance as alan foster is great  and the rest of the performances are also very good .  castle of blood  is outstanding in many departments barbara steele delivers one of her best performances  the cinematography and locations are beautifully haunting beyond comparison  the atmosphere is incredibly eerie . . . the film simply is a perfect whole of atmosphere  gothic beauty and the art of terror . in short  castle of blood  is one of the most atmospheric and greatest gothic horror films ever made  and must not be missed by anyone interested in the genre        ,1
this movie is horrible  it rivals  ishtar  in the number of embarrassingly bad moments . i would have rated it lower than a   save for a couple of funny lines but  overall  this film was crap  it looked like they made it over a weekend at some bankrupt resort somewhere . joe roth should join elaine may on the directing sidelines forever   ,0
the most satisfying element about  dan in real life  is that the relationship between dan  steve carell  and marie  juliette binoche  makes sense and is beautifully realistic . the casting of oscar  winner juliette binoche as dan  s love interest was a superb decision she is exceptionally talented  intelligent  naturally attractive and  thank goodness  appropriately aged for the part  had this movie been made with jessica alba or scarlett johansson  it would have been a disaster .  br    br   another wonderful aspect about  dan in real life  is that it is a perfect film for adults who are interested in a mature comedy that leaves out the three pillars of the  frat pack  formula dumb chicks  chauvinistic guys  and sleazy jokes .  dan in real life  is witty and has fun  intelligent laughs throughout . whereas other comedies incorporate or are almost entirely based on jokes that shock the audience into laughing  the jokes from  dan in real life  are more natural and clever  and involve some thinking on the part of the audience .  br    br   my only problem with  dan in real life  is that the rebellious  middle daughter is played too outrageously by actress brittany robertson . it  s difficult to say if this was a personal choice on her part or a choice by the director . either way  her character is unrealistic and annoying . but  this is only a minor flaw in the film  and does not take away from the story as a whole .  br    br   all in all   dan in real life  is a great film  a fantastic escape from the redundancy of offensive and dumbed  down comedies . the quality of the writing  directing  acting  and  especially  cinematography is excellent . it is simply a beautiful  light  hearted comedy .  ,1
this is what happens when you  re living in china and the local video store is running thin on english  language titlesyou are blessed with this work of what appears to be  yes  romanian cinema . nevertheless  i think that it has real comedic potential .  br    br   spoilers technically follow  br    br   though i don  t think that it would in fact spoil anyone  s viewing pleasure to ask why a film set in a casino has a scene of beach archery  even in flashback . that mystery  and many other conundrums  remain to be exploited by desperate comedians  perhaps when they  re stuck in bucharest .  br    br   let me also wonder aloud why perfectly good  looking people allow themselves to abuse themselves on film like this . it  s sad .  ,0
iq is a cute romantic comedy featuring two great actors that seem to click well on screen . plot is a typical guy wrong for girl  guy gets girl format  but makes the solid point that one must love with the heart and not the the mind . addition of albert einstein and his band of geniuses provides excellent comic relief . overall  a good movie . not great  but good  ,1
this film is a spicy little piece of film  making from sam fuller which gives richard widmark the chance to show of some of his best  most edgy acting in the role of skip mccoy  a small  time thief who stumbles onto a military secret while picking beautiful candy  s  jean peters  pocket on a crowded bus . it turns out candy was doing a favor for her  ex   boyfriend  who  s working for the  commies  .  br    br   superficially  there  s a mystery here regarding candy  s motives and skip spends much of the film determining her motives . actually he seems to just initially assume that she  s a  commie   going so far as to pour beer in her face in a callous gesture . but the real question is  what  s going on with skip  what are his motives  and why does candy like him so much  why do we  the audience  want to like him so much  basically what the film  makers have done here is create a very striking  male fatale  in widmark  s character and his performance . just as the male audience tends to ponder through the length of a film like  the big sleep  or  the glass key  along with the main characters whether the female character is trustworthy or just a pretty face  the film  makers have here created a similar quandary for female viewers . widmark is handsome  and there  s also a charm in his boyish insouciance  but the first two times he meets our leading lady  he robs her and then punches her in the face . eventually the question becomes  would skip sink so low as to sell out his country for a buck  his comments to the police  like  you  re waving a flag at me   make us suspect he would  or is he simply out for revenge for the murder of his friend moe  thelma ritter   i  m not sure that the film gives us a conclusive answer either way .  br    br   thelma ritter  s character work deserves special mention  she has created a truly indelible character here . fuller isn  t afraid to give her plenty of  business   in the form of physical objects that she uses to draw the audience into her world  particularly her used ties . another example of fuller  s  business  would be the scene with victor perry  an actor i  ve seen elsewhere used to less effect  using the chopsticks to intimidate candy .  br    br   the emphasis on moe  s relationship with skip provides one of cinema  s most revealing  honor among thieves  themes . in fact skip has the same kind of ease and the same kind of casual relationship with the police  with the notable exception of capt . tiger  murvyn vye  who has a grudge against him . i loved the scene where he invited the cops in by name and offered them a beer when they came to pick him up at his shack . those are the kind of details that make this film feel real  whether or not it really is  realistic  or whether that would matter are entirely separate questions .  br    br   all told  i would say this is an essential crime film which displays a lot of the best and most durable attributes of the  film noir  school of film  making . a predictable plot is off  set by a host of colorful characters  uniformly well  performed   cheap sets are disguised by the film  s unrelenting pace  and the final product feels a lot more substantial than it probably is . this is the best film i  ve seen so far by sam fuller and helps me to see better why he  s regarded as a master director  here he accomplished some things that i think he tried but ultimately failed to do in other films like  the crimson kimono  and  shock corridor  as far as very emphatic acting styles and really gripping suspense . this is one of my favorite performances from widmark that i  ve seen so far  and widmark was a talent that i  m tempted to say  based on the few extraordinary films i  ve seen with him  was comparable to that of alan ladd or humphrey bogart  although arguably he didn  t make as many classic films .  ,1
 . . . and even then  even they can live without seeing it . to be honest  this film  if one deigns to call it that  is of real interest only to bondage freaks . bettie page fans will learn absolutely nothing new  and i do mean nothing   nor will they enjoy the warm fuzzies of experiencing anything familiar  loved  or cherished .  br    br   nevermind the abysmal screenplay  the wooden  less  than  community  theater acting  the utter absence of direction  the crappy lighting  or any of the rest of the bargain basement production values . this is definitely  hey  kids  let  s make a movie   movie  making of the lowest order . i suppose one could be thankful that at least they knew how to run the camera . no  i  m sorry to say that none of that is germane to why this thing is so outright wrong .  br    br   it  s wrong because the young lady playing bettie page  a somewhat zaftig girl whose only resemblance to the queen of curves is dark hair and the trademark bangs  utterly fails to bring anything to the role beyond a willingness to be bound and gagged . this is apparently a good thing for her film career before and since this wretched excess  but not for the wretched excess itself  which consists primarily of a number of lovingly re  enacted bd set  pieces sandwiched between horrendously awful faux  biographical scenes delineating ms . page  s fall from grace  so to speak  . there  s actually probably more information  per se  about page  s life in the opening and closing credits than the rest of the movie .  br    br   do not be fooled . this is not a worthy companion film to  the notorious bettie page .  this is not a worthy film at all . this is a fetish piece that trades on the allure of one of the greatest pin  ups of all time  and does it without class  without style  and without any real sense of understanding the character of bettie page whatsoever . no true bettie page fan will find it to be anything but a disappointment  i guarantee that .  br    br   avoid at all costs . if free  remember that time is money  too . yours may not be worth much  but i  m betting it  s worth enough that you  ll be sorry you wasted time with this one . that  s it  i  m done  you  ve been warned .  ,0

this is a great idea for a film but it  unfortunately  doesn  t turn out to be a great movie . what starts out as a sweet and almost goofy romantic comedy about a fluffer in love with his fluffee spirals out of control into a bizarre combination of genres and a veritable stew of plots  with liberal borrowings from boogie nights  thelma and louise  showgirls  frisk  and even a curious  dash  of    blows thrown in towards the end .  at least the director did his research   the result is not necessarily boring but  in the end  this slick  well  produced flick doesn  t quite add up to anything . however  the actors all do a game job with the material and there are a few good laughs at the behind  the  scenes world of gay porn .  br    br    ,0
this movie is just so good  despite carmen electra  this has to be one of the better films i have seen in awhile . jamie kennedy is just amazing  and loren dean plays an insane spoiled movie star very well . the plot is great as well . it  s all very real which is scary . it says here that it  s a drama  but this is one of the damn funniest dramas i have ever seen . go check it out .  ,1
in this excellent twentieth  century fox film  noir  the metropolis is a labyrinth of despair in which scavengers and predators survive by living off one another . brooding cityscapes lower over puny humanity in bleak expressionist symbolism .  br    br   a prostitute has her purse snatched on the subway . it contains a microfilm  and a communist spy ring will go to any lengths to recover it . two parallel investigations unfold as both spies and cops hunt down the precious information .  br    br   anti  hero pickpocket skip mccoy is played with scornful assurance by richard widmark . he knows the cops to be his moral equals and intellectual inferiors  so he taunts them  go on   he says to captain dan tiger  murvyn vye    drum up a charge . throw me in . you  ve done it before .  in this pitiless world  the cops are just one more gang on the streets . just as candy the hooker bribes lightning louie to get a lead  so the police are busy paying stool pigeons for information .  br    br   it is hard to believe that when widmark made this film he was already in early middle age . the    year  old star  coming to the end of his contract with fox  plays the upstart skip mccoy with the irreverent brashness of a teenager . today it may not be acceptable for the romantic lead to punch his love interest into unconsciousness then revive her by sloshing beer in her face  but by the mores of the period it signified toughness  and candy  after all  is a fallen woman .  br    br   jean peters is radiant as candy . here  right in the middle of her five  year burst of b  movie fame  she is beautiful and engaging as the whore with the golden heart . she is the story  s victim  a martyr to her beauty as much as anything else . she means well  but is constantly being manipulated by cynical men  joey  skip and the cops .  br    br   the real star of this movie is new york . haunting urban panoramas and snidering subway stations offer a claustrophobic evocation of the city as a living  malevolent force . like maggots in a rotting cheese  human figures scurry through the city  s byways . elevators  subway turnstiles  sidewalks  even a dumb waiter act as conduits for the flow of corrupt humanity . people cling to any niche that affords safety moe has her grimy rented room  skip his tenebrous shack on the hudson river . as the characters move and interact  they are framed by bridge architecture  or lattices of girders  or are divided by hanging winch tackle . the personality of the city is constantly imposing itself . the angles and crossbeams of the wharf timbers are an echo of the gridiron street plan  and the card  index cabinets in the squadroom mimic the manhattan skyline . when joey  s exit from the subway is barred  it is as if the steel sinews of the city are ensnaring him .  br    br   a surprising proportion of this film is shot in extreme close  up . character drives the plot  as it should  and the close  ups are used to augment character . when skip interrogates candy  the close  up captures the sexual energy between them  belying the hostility of skip  s words . jean peters  beauty is painted in light  in exquisite soft focus close  ups . the device is also employed to heighten the tension . the opening sequence  the purse snatch  contains no dialogue the drama relies entirely on close  up for its powerful effect .  br    br   snoopers  and snoopers upon snoopers  populate the film . moe  thelma ritter  makes a living as an informant  and her place in the hierarchy is accepted  even by her victims . when skip observes   she  s gotta eat   he is chanting a recurring refrain . just as  straight  new yorkers peddle lamb chops or lumber  the underworld traffics in the commodity of information .  br    br   and yet even the stool pigeons are superior to joey and his communist friends . joey  s feet on moe  s bed symbolise a transgression of the most basic moral code . joey is beyond the pale . moe will not trade with joey  even to preserve her life  . . . even in our crummy business  you gotta draw the line somewhere .   br    br    pick  up  was made in the depths of the cold war . richard nixon had just been chosen as the republican vice  presidential candidate  having made his name with his phoney alger hiss expose  bogus communist microfilm and all . the mccarthy show trials were a daily reality . we see the cops in the movie inveigh against  the traitors who gave stalin the a  bomb  .  br    br   new york can be seen as a giant receptacle in which human offal cheats  squeals and murders . containers form a leitmotif throughout the film . moe carries her trade mark box of ties  and candy  s purse  container of the microfilm  is the engine of the plot . skip keeps his only possessions in a submerged crate  symbolising his secretive street  wisdom . the paupers  coffins  moving down the hudson on a barge  are containers of just one more cargo being shifted around the pitiless metropolis .  br    br   the film is a masterpiece of composition . candy is shown above the skulking skip on the rickety gangway of the shack  signifying her moral ascendancy . when the gun is placed on the table  the extreme perspective makes it look bigger than candy  violence is beginning to dwarf compassion . the lovers are eclipsed by the shadow of a stevedore  s hook  reminding us that their love is neither pure nor absolute  but contingent upon the whims of the sinister city . enyard the communist is a shadow on a wall  or a disembodied puff of cigarette smoke . he is like the lone alley cat amongst the garbage  a predatory phantom of the night . camera shots from under taxi hoods  inside newspaper kiosks and through the bars of hospital beds constantly reinforce in us the awareness that we are all trapped in the metropolis . we are civilisation  s mulch .  ,1
this movie is mostly crap and the only reason this movie is worth watching is because jean  claud vam damme stars in this movie . there are some good action scenes in this movie and the best ones are at the end of the movie .  br    br   the acting in this movie is so bad and its the worst acting i have ever seen and the  actors bill goldberg and michael jai white can not act at all . and this movie by far has to be one of jean  claud vam dammes worst movies he has done and if u what to watch him in one of his great movies u should watch blood sport  kickboxer or sudden death .  br    br   over all this movie is crap  ok and my rating is  out of   .  ,0
spoiler warning there are some minor spoilers in this review . don  t read it beyond the first paragraph if you plan on seeing the film .  br    br   the disney channel currently has a policy to make loads of movies and show one a month on the cable channel . most of these are mediocre and drab  having a few good elements but still being a disappointment  phantom of the megaplex   stepsister from planet weird   zenon girl of the   st century   . every once in a great while  they make something really  really great  genius   the other me   . but once in a while the disney channel makes a huge mistake  and gives us a real stinker . this month  december      the disney channel featured the ultimate christmas present   which i thought was terrible due to poor writing and worse acting . apparently  the brainiacs . com  was rushed out a few days before christmas to get a jump on the holiday  because the plot has to do with toys . they even paid for a feature in the tv guide  so i thought it must be better than the norm . i was in for a complete shock . only disney  s model behaviour  has been worse than this .  br    br   the plot was more far  fetched than normal . i usually let that slide  but here it just goes too far . matthew tyler gets very sick of his widowed father spending most of his time at work . his father owns a small toy factory that has taken out large loans at a scrupulous bank to stay afloat . time and time again  his father has to skip out on the plans he makes with his son and daughter . matthew decides that the only way he can spend time with his dad is if he becomes the boss and orders him to stay home . he gets a hair  brained idea to create a website where kids all around the world can find and send him a dollar to invest in a computer chip that his sister is inventing . that whole concept is full of fallacies . when kids send in millions of dollars  matthew opens his own company  s bank account and buys up most of his dad  s business  s stock . he is the secret boss  but he doesn  t reveal this to his dad  but instead presents himself at board meetings as a cartoon image through a computer . that image itself is so complex  and ridiculous  that it isn  t possible for someone to create it at home  much less someone who comes across as stupid as matthew . to make a long plot short  matthew orders his dad to spend more time having fun and doing stuff with his kids  but a federal agent shows up inquiring about matthew  s company  as it is fraudulent .  br    br   there  s so much wrong here . as mentioned  the stuff they do here is impossible even for true geniuses  which these kids are not . the website  the cartoon image  the computer chip  even the stuff they are being taught in school  are far too advanced for these kids . the acting by most of the cast  especially kevin kilner  is terrible . some familiar faces are wasted . dom deluise plays the evil bank owner  but his part is a throwaway . he has one good scene with alexandra paul  who shows she has the ability to act  in which he explains his motives  but nothing more . and rich little is wasted in a small role as a judge . there  s even some offensive and uncalled for anti  russian jokes . but the greatest atrocities are the hard  hammered themes . these themes show up in many of the disney channel  s films  but never before have these ultra  conservative messages been pounded so strongly . the typical overworking parent  idea is really pushed hard  and after delivering it inappropriately in the ultimate christmas present   seeing it again sours my mood . family relations are important  but disney must stop this endless preaching  because working is important to maintaining a workable family  too . except for cancelling activities thanks to work  the father didn  t come across as that bad  but i found it offensive when the grandmother told him i don  t like what i see .  just as bad is the preaching of the idea that all single parents must marry if they want to raise their kids right . enter alexandra paul  whose character  while important to the plot  is there solely to be the love interest for the father . this offensiveness only proves that the disney brain trust lacks the brains to avoid scraping from the bottom of the disney script barrel . instead of letting this movie teach your kids how to commit serious fraud  wait for the next disney channel movie . it has to be better than this . zantara  s score  out of   .  ,0
just a regular jason lee movie  there were some parts of the movie that were funny . the undertone of the move is to live life on the edge i guess . these are the types of movies that i think   year old girls watch at slumber parties . it was an all right movie . it is kind of one of those movies you have on in the back ground and look up every now and then to when something catches attention . i think that julia stiles and selma blair are a good combination and would like to see them in a movie with a good story and plot . its just kind of a boy meets girl movie . this is that perfect movie they would show on comedy central . i am glad that i didn  t see this movie in the theater  i would have been angry . but i guess that  s why i didn  t see it in the theater .  ,0
this film was great .  br    br   the plot was preposterous .  br    br   the action sequences contrived .  br    br   but  provided you can lighten up enough to laugh  it was a throughly thrilling romp combining keystone cops and the lone ranger .  br    br   the baddies were more silly than bad . the good guys weren  t too good . the black actors played normal characters rather than black stereotypes .  br    br   the inclusion of a baby added a good touch . sympathy might have been a little difficult otherwise .  br    br   i have to disagree about the acting . it was  on the whole  very good . i really wanted to punch judge reinhold .  br    br   and  after all  isn  t that the mark of a really good movie  wanting to punch judge reinhold   ,1
man  this gets a lot of good reviews in the review books . frankly  i found it too slow and unappealing right from the start . i kept waiting for it to pick up a little steam but that never happened . this movie is vastly overrated .  br    br   shakespeare  with the king james english  has never appealed to me  anyway  so it may just be me . there is a fair share of the latter in the first half of the film as they show ronald colman playing the role of othello .  br    br   the good points of the film include  thanks to a restored print  some decent cinematography and a young  slim and attractive shelly winters .  br    br   overall  this is simply too boring  too much repetition in some of the scenes to watch again . besides  we all know that most actors are nut  cases  anyway  but kudos to hollywood for demonstrating it here in this story .  ,0
this is my third comment here attempting to connect two legendary movie comedy teams laurel  hardy and abbott  costello . the connection here is the year     . that  s the date that the former had their last movie from their longtime home studio of hal roach . i  ll mention the significance of the latter later on . besides being the last time stan and ollie worked at the lot of fun  it  s also the final time they would appear with such familiar supporting players like charlie hall and james finlayson who appeared in most of their films . it  s also the last time art lloyd would serve as their cameraman and marvin hatley  who composed their theme song which would be known as  the cuckoo song  dance of the cuckoos    their score . and it would be the very last time stan laurel would be allowed to exercise complete creative control over what goes on film . if there is a more gag  laden structure than usual in this l  h film  it  s nice to know most of those gags are indeed funny . that includes most of the sound and visual effects  the latter provided by longtime roach staffer roy seawright . in this one  ollie has  hornophobia  from working at a noisy horn factory so dr . finlayson prescribes going out to sea for his rest . ollie doesn  t like to go boating so stan suggests they just rent one that  s docked so they wouldn  t have to go anywhere . after they find one they like  we find out that convict nick grainger  richard cramer  has just escaped . . . i  ll stop there and say this was as good a finale for l  h  s longtime home as one could hope for . it  s hilarious mostly from beginning to end and knowing this would be their last for the man partly responsible for their teaming is indeed poignant when one thinks of it . oh  and i have a couple more lasts to mention it  s the final film appearance of both harry bernard  who plays a harbor patrolman after years of encountering stan and ollie as a policeman  and that of ben turpin  the cross  eyed comic who was born in new orleans which is a couple of hours away from my current hometown of baton rouge  whose second l  h appearance this was having previously  married  the boys in our wife . the latter performer especially has a genuine comic moment . all right  i mentioned     being the year stan and ollie had their last movie released from hal roach studios . it was also the first year that a comedy team  both born in the state of new jersey  would make their first picture at what would be their home studio  universal . the director of that movie would be the same one that guided l  h in the flying deuces the previous year . his name was a . edward sutherland . p . s . it was during this filming that script supervisor virginia lucille jones had an accident involving a rolled  up carpet . that incident caused oliver  babe  hardy to send her roses to her hospital room . they fell in love and married on march       . it lasted until babe  s death in     .  ,1
gus van sant has made some excellent films . i truly am a fan .  br    br   however  i can  t help but feel that the cerebral edge of tom robbins book  even cowgirls get the blues  is lost in translation to the big screen . alone  tom robbins and gus van sant are incredible visionaries and towers of talent . ultimately though this one just didn  t work .  br    br   it wasn  t that the characters weren  t well developed or the plot and content didn  t come alive . it  s just that our imaginations are much more powerful when reading a book like this . we  re taken away to a different time and place and we sometimes think the worst and  or the best and it adds to the overall roller  coaster of the book as it neatly unfolds according to the author  s precision . movies however can leave one with less of the imagination and emotion roller  coaster detracting from the overall experience . this is what i believe happened here .  br    br   i suggest reading the book   ,1
bill paxton stars in and directs this highly original film . having watched the first time i was by how good it was . the reviews i had heard were ok . as a result i was expecting an average thriller at most . however because of paxtons excellent directing and acting the film is well worth watching  especially if you are a horror film fanatic . the film is also helped by the plot twists which keep coming until the closing credits . the films strongest point is the storyline which i have to say is highly original and is like i have ever seen before . well done also to the  young leads which perfectly convey the emotions if these confused boys . i give this film     and i highly recommend that everyone catches it .  ,1
i was so excited to see this film because i had always heard it was very scary .  br    br   what  s interesting about it is that it is a japanese film they decided to bring to america  but they actually filmed it in japan with the original crew  i think this made the film . . . more japanese  which is probably why it managed to be fairly successful unlike most japan  to  america horror movie flops  but it also made it a bit inaccessible to american audiences . the difference in what scares the japanese culture and what scares the american culture felt present throughout the film . this worked well in moments when they meant to capture the nervous fear of the main character a frightened fish in a big  busy  unfamiliar  tokyo pond .  br    br   the storyline was quite confusing as well . in typical japanese fashion it is extremely complicated and confusing . the beginning of the movie is actually the middle of the story and from there we move constantly forwards and backwards until  at the end of the film  we see the ending and beginning of the whole story . this constant flipping through time was very much confusing for me . also  i didn  t think some things were explained so well and i had to ask my friend to explain them to me  she had already seen it  as well as the sequel which apparently reveals more of the story  .  br    br   overall  there is plenty for american audiences to love  tons of freaky imagery and macabre details which a healthy splash of jump scenes .  ,1
the ladies man is laugh out loud funny  with a great diverse cast as well as having some very stupid but excellent scenes  including the funniest love song ever written  .  br    br   ferrell is his usual quality self in a brilliant side role .  br    br   tim meadows plays an idiot surprisingly well and has written himself some of the funniest lines you  ll find in any comedy out there .  br    br   it is definitely worth a purchase as watching it every  months or so will lead to you still laughing as hard as you did first time round .  br    br   i am distraught to think at the time of writing this that it has a meagre  .     and i urge you to vote   br    br   and remember kids   theres more motion in the ocean   ,1
the story of the untouchable who acted like a great soldier  saving the lives of hundreds if not thousands  is told in the     film  gunga din .  based loosely on the rudyard kipling poem  the film is brilliantly directed by george stevens and stars cary grant  douglas fairbanks jr . and victor mclagen . the title role is played by sam jaffe  well known in my era as ben casey  s boss  dr . zorba  a name that became synonymous with big  out of control hair . say  dr . zorba hair  to anyone of my generation  and they know what you  re talking about .  br    br   set in india at the time of the british occupation  three soldiers  two romantic  dashing figures in grant and fairbanks  and mclagen as a big lug  are cut  ups  in reality  three overgrown boys . gunga din is the water carrier  treated somewhat meanly  verbally  anyway  by mcchesney  mclaglen   but cutter  grant  is fond of him . when he catches din  pronounced deen  practicing being his soldier walk and salute as he apes the unit during their maneuvers  cutter gives him a few pointers .  br    br   the merry band of musketeers is going to break up when ballantine  fairbanks  announces he  s about to be married to a lovely young woman  joan fontaine  and leaving the service . however  when gunga din and cutter run across thugees  a murderous cult led by a guru  eduardo cianelli   gunga din escapes to warn the unit  and ballantine insists on re  enlisting to help save cutter . it  s a buddy movie after all .  br    br    gunga din  starts out lightheartedly  with slapstick and wonderful  broad comedy  particularly by cary grant  who is quite funny . both he and fairbanks are so handsome  it  s hard to decide which one to look at first . much of the film is made up of huge action sequences which are very exciting . in the last part  the story becomes very dramatic and culminates in a tense  thrilling battle .  br    br   grant has the showiest role  fairbanks is the lovesick romantic  and mclaglen as mcchesney  mostly due to his treatment of gunga din  is the most unlikeable character  although one detects his soft heart in his love for his elephant annie . his softness comes through toward the end of the movie  particularly in the very touching  tear  jerking final scene .  br    br   always a gentle and likable actor  sam jaffe gives a beautiful performance as gunga din  a simple  brave man with a big smile  powerful imagination and lofty dreams . without much dialogue  jaffe conveys gunga din  s soul magnificently .  br    br   this is truly the ultimate adventure film  massive in scope  with good acting  rousing scenes  a wonderful musical score  and some beautiful cinematic images . another one from that remarkable year      . highly recommended .  ,1
the image of movie studios being financially  driven instead of creatively is not without truth  in fact  it  s more true than false  . this begs the question why castle rock entertainment allowed kenneth branagh to create a full  length  uncut version of  hamlet  with his complete creative control among other things . of course  branagh had to agree to some concessions  a star  studded cast  and a  .  hour version for wider release   but why would the film studio allow branagh to spend money on a  hour version that they knew few would see  could they have  at least in this case  had enough respect for the material and branagh  s vision to create something for only a few people  that is not a question that i can answer . whatever the reason  this is a glorious vision for those who are willing to spend four hours watching  hamlet .  everyone knows the story  so i will not spend much time on that . however  unlike other productions of the play  stage included  this is a completely uncut production  which has never been done before . according to some  shakespeare never intended for the play to be produced uncut  leaving the decision of what to include to the director  s discretion . that being said  i have no doubt that had he been able to see it  the bard would have been overjoyed with branagh  s production .  br    br   the film is top  heavy with film stars  although most have mere bit parts . all play their parts equally well . i would have thought branagh too old to play the part of hamlet  and while he still may be  his performance more than makes up for it . hamlet is a complex part  displaying every emotion from grief to anger  happiness to madness  and everything in between . branagh nailed it . derek jacobi is terrific as the wily claudius  whose deception and treachery sets all these things in motion his unique voice is perfect for the role . julie christie is also very good as gertrude  hamlet  s caring mother who doesn  t realize what is going on until late in the game .  br    br   the classical actors are cast in bit parts  judi dench is on for all of   seconds and has no lines   but at least they  re in it . surprisingly  no one takes this to heart everyone gives it their all  and it shows . special mention has to go to jack lemmon and billy crystal  who are excellent . robin williams is a little too silly  but he  s not bad  his part is pretty small anyway  .  br    br   yet  this is undeniably branagh  s show . he adapted one of the most famous plays in history  and in so doing  he took on a whale of a project it  s impressive that he got it done  but the fact that the film is this good is a monumental achievement . what i really liked about this film is that you don  t have to be a shakespeare scholar to enjoy it . as most people know  shakespeare is difficult to digest  but branagh and his cast understand this .  hamlet  is still immensely enjoyable to just sit and listen to the actors deliver the brilliant dialogue and excellent acting .  br    br   this is a must see for anyone and everyone . it may be four hours long  but it  s definitely worth it .  ,1
by     the western was an exhausted genre and the makers of this film clearly knew it . still  instead of shelving the project and saving us from having to watch it  they went ahead and made it anyway . apparently in need of an interesting thread to get the audiences to come and see the film  they decided to make it as blatantly violent and unpleasant as possible . hell  it worked for the wild bunch so why shouldn  t it work here  of course  the wild bunch had the benefit of a superb script but the script of the last hard men is plain old  fashioned rubbish .  br    br   it  s hard to figure out what attracted charlton heston and james coburn to their respective roles . heston plays a retired lawman who goes after an escaped bunch of convicts led by a violent outlaw  coburn  . the hunt becomes even more personal when heston  s daughter  barbara hershey  is kidnapped by the convicts and subjected to sexual degradation .  br    br   this is a bloodthirsty film indeed in which every time someone dies it is displayed in over  the  top detail . it  s tremendously disappointing really  because the star pairing sounds like a mouth  watering prospect . there  s no sense of pace or urgency in the film either . it takes an eternity to get going  but when the action finally does come it is marred by the emphasis on nastiness . all in all  this might be the very worst film that heston ever made . i  m sure it  s one of the productions he is loathe to include on his illustrious cv .  ,0
  the color purple   is truly amazing . there is none like it  and i don  t think there ever will be . it  s a roller coster of emotion and pain that the viewer takes on . the actors are flawless and the directing is superb . i absolutely loved it . a movie has never made me so happy . it is beautiful  that  s the best way to explain it .  ,1
handsome and dashing british airline pilot george taylor  a solid portrayal by guiseppe pambieri  gets beat up by thugs after a wild night in hong kong . george meets and falls in love with the sweet and virginal dr . emy wong  a fine and charming performance by the lovely chai lee  . george regains his health and goes back to work . when emy fails to hear from george for a lengthy amount of time  she succumbs to despair and becomes a prostitute . while director  co  writer bitto albertini does indeed deliver a satisfying amount of the expected tasty nudity and steamy soft  core sex  this film is anything but your routine wallow in leering sleaze . instead it  s a surprisingly thoughtful  touching and tragic love story between two well drawn and highly appealing characters  chai as emy wong is especially radiant and endearing  . the picture starts out bubbly and cheerful  but the tone radically shifts into a more grim and harsh mood about two thirds of the way through . emy  s descent into vice after she falsely assumes that george has abandoned her is bleak and upsetting ditto the remarkably sad and heartbreaking surprise bummer ending . granted  the narrative is certainly melodramatic  but never too silly or trashy . moreover  the sex scenes are quite tasteful and even genuinely erotic . notorious italian porn star ilona staller has a nice sizable supporting part as george  s jealous and uninhibited secretary helen miller . guido mancori  s polished cinematography offers many strikingly gorgeous shots of the exotic locations . nico fidenco  s funky  throbbing score hits the groovy spot . worth a look for those seeking something different .  ,1
this is one creepy movie . creepier than anything david lynch  and that shows what a great director polanski is since this is not his usual type of work  and it is brilliant .  br    br   it all starts of with trelkovski moves into a tenement block in paris . he soon learns that the previous tenant  a young woman  committed suicide and he believes the rest of the people living there drove her to it . he also believes that they are trying to do the same to him . what results is a amazing and frightening look at paranoia .  br    br   the whole production has classical horror written all over it from the imagery to the music the viewer can feel poor trelkovski  s terror building up .  br    br   are they all out to kill him  or maybe just drive him mad  is there a difference  find out for yourself .       ,1

in the hands of lesser actors than claudette colbert and robert ryan this film could have become silly and trite . but  with these two experienced thespians leading the way  i found  silent fury  to be a most exciting and pleasurable little mystery . when their wedding is interrupted by a stranger who claims that colbert is already married  and that he was best man at that wedding  one can sense that there is some sort of plot against her at work . as colbert  ryan  and her attorney set out to disprove the strangers claim of a prior marriage  they are met at every turn by more evidence that seems to reinforce the claim that she is indeed already wed . although it  s not very difficult to figure out just who the main  baddie  is  it  s still lots of fun as the intensity and pace of the story increases . all in all  a good  solid mystery film with fine performances by the two leading actors and a fine supporting cast which includes the often underrated paul kelly .  ,1

there have been countless talking  animal films in the past  the majority of which either feature animals  mouths digitally animated to nearly match the voice acting  or are ridiculously amateur .  homeward bound the incredible journey  is neither .  br    br   this film doesn  t need the infant  pleasing addition of moving canine lips  or gesturing feline limbs . it has the ability to make you believe that the animals are authentically talking to one another  and you can get rather emotionally attached to them at heart  as all great boy  and  and  his  dog films should  .  br    br   homeward bound is the epitome of all family  friendly animal romps to me  and boasts some beautiful cinematography  an inspiring soundtrack  from the genius of bruce broughton   and an impressive cast . . .  br    br   michael j . fox . . . chance  br    br   sally field . . . sassy  br    br   don ameche . . . shadow  br    br   frank welker  voice god  . . . various  br    br   it is a modernised version of the children  s classic work of fiction  the incredible journey   which was made into a semi  documentary film by disney long long ago in     . the sequel  lost in san fransisco  isn  t nearly as good a film  but extends the adventure of my favourite furry  footed friends  and is a fun urban  twist on the grand  outdoor  adventure theme . want to entertain your children with a witty  pretty  heart  warming mini  epic  without the idiotic and often utterly ridiculous comedy of modern children  s cinema  parents  buy all three films for your children  now  thank you  disney  for bringing a tear to my eyes with each time i watch this early    s classic   ,1
i love this movie . i mean the story may not be the best  but the dancing most certainly makes up for it . you get to know a little bit about each character the way they want you to learn about them . i just think that you won  t like this movie unless you  re into broadway . . .  ,1
i  m a big fan of horror flicks  and zombie films are a particular favorite of mine . that said  zombi  is one of the absolute worst films i have ever seen . so needless to say i really enjoyed it  it  s the best bad movie i  ve seen in a long while . the story has some similarities with dan o  bannon  s  return of the living dead   but whereas that film was intentionally funny  this one is the opposite . it has some of the most laughable acting i  ve ever witnessed  especially from the main scientist character . his scenes with the general were just hysterical . also  the effects are subpar and in many cases sloppy  and the death scenes are often just downright stupid . this  of course  makes it all the more fun . possible spoiler  the worst is the scene where the guy opens the refrigerator door and sees the severed zombie head  which then opens its eyes and somehow flies out of the fridge  obviously pulled out ineptly with a bit of string   latching onto the guys neck  killing him . zombie heads have the ability to float in the air now  it defies every law of physics known to man  and it  s one of the most absurd things ever filmed . that  s just one of many really goofy moments in the idiotic mess . i can  t believe it  s gotten so high a rating here . if you are a fan of bad movies  do yourself a favor and rent this sucker .  ,0
definitely a very good idea  screenplay was just ok . could have been better  the positives are that it doesn  t bore you if you  re an adventure lover  a new idea about the lost world of atlantis . negatives are that i personally feel that this idea had so much more potential than this . they should  ve ended up with a better adventure than this . it wasn  t bad at all but it would have been much better with some more runtime . enjoyed it a lot though  cant say that it was boring or wasn  t good . . a good one for the people who like adventure animations like sindbad  like the road to el dorado . this movie is also recommended for people looking for a nice little adventure with a very nice happy ending .  ,1

making a book into a movie by following the story page  by  page is never a good idea . when people read the book  they automatically start making their own  mental movie  of who the characters look like  the places they exist in  how the situations progress . and everybody  s mind  s  eye opus is different  which is why when the  real  movie finally comes out  you  re always going to have a ticked  off segment of the movie  going audience who are disappointed that it just doesn  t measure up .  br    br   all a screenwriter and a director can hope to accomplish is whatever their own vision of the movie is  and hope that it comes as close as possible to what their audience is expecting to see .  br    br   there is no better case for this situation than the movies based on the novels of stephen king . when filmmakers capture at least the essence of his stories  the results can be breathtaking and truly terrifying  carrie   salem  s lot  the dead zone   or they can be what fans consider to be a gawd  awful mess  kubrick  s version of the shining the miniseries for it and the tommyknockers  .  br    br   although it  s not even close to being the perfect king adaptation  pet sematary has so many moments of just skin  and  bone  deep unease that seemed to have bled onto the screen directly from the book  that you can pretty much forgive its shortcomings . for that  we have music video  turned  film director mary lambert to thank   she also directed siesta  not exactly a horror movie  but another freaky  as  hell must  see you should put on your list   working from a screenplay by the  man  ster  himself  and probably one of his better ones .  br    br   since the majority of you know the story  i won  t put you to sleep with too many of the details . dr . louis creed  dale midkiff  has moved his family out to the perfect house in the country . well  almost perfect  except for two nasty little details the dangerously busy stretch of interstate highway out in front  and the large pet cemetery in the woods out back . since louis is a veterinarian and has a young toddler for a son . . . well  even if you haven  t read the book  do the frickin  math . it is a king story  after all  so no mystery where this is headed .  br    br   it  s not so much the destination that counts here  but the spooky stops along the way . certain scenes that are so familiar from the book are brought to shivery  scream  inducing life here rachel creed  s  star trek  s denise crosby  horrific memory of her terminally ill  crippled sister louis  s encounters with the mortally injured jogger victor pascow  brad greenquist   both before and after his death the trip into the  other  cemetery beyond the pet cemetery . and that third act . . . if it doesn  t give you a few nightmares  maybe you should check your pulse .  br    br   good performances by all here  especially the late fred gwynne as the well  intentioned neighbor  jud crandall  who gets the best line in the story that sums it all up  sometimes  dead is better .   br    br   about the only problem with the movie version is the casting of louis  s son  gage  miko hughes  . knowing that it would be damn near impossible to get the kind of performance needed from a kid that age to seal the deal on this  lambert and crew still did the best they could  and unfortunately  hughes at the time was just too damn cute to  sell  his intended role as an evil  demon  possessed zombie . this takes you out of the movie whenever he shows up  though the scenes where he  s featured are still masterfully staged   especially gwynne  s death scene .   br    br   other than that  everything else is still about as good as it gets . carrie still holds the title for best king adaptation as far as i  m concerned but sematary is right up there in the top five .  br    br   still  will anything adapted for the screen based on a king book be as terrifying as reading the story  not bloody likely . . . for now .  ,1
usually i don  t really like emma roberts so much  but after watching nancy drew it kind of changed my mind . the actors in the movies made the whole thing exciting and funny . most of the time when you watch a mystery movie you can solve it before the middle of the show  but in this movie it  s like you are actually there . the clues have to all fit together until you can finally understand the whole crime . i am still amazed how she found it out . the whole movie was really clever and the people who watched it with me loved the movie too . the clothes were my favorite part of the movie  it was so cute . i don  t think there will be another movie like this until the sequel comes out . i give it a nine because the popular girls didn  t really seem to have the part just right  but they still make me laugh . it was a really great movie and a great mystery . i definitely recommend watching it .  ,1
when i saw this animation for first time  i was   maybe  i was really impressed  it has completely different style compared to the japan animation and i kinda like it more . tho whole impression of the movie is more sinister and dark . . . the colors are not that . . . colorous . the characters don  t talk much  there are no long and boring conversations of this and that  like in ghost in the shell  . with its dark pictures  views of strange beasts and sense of magic  it looks like one of those ancient scandinavian stories  full of violence and horrendous creators  enchanted forests and deep caves  dwelled by dragons  throlls  orks . . . and one mysterious hero to stop evil . . .  ,1

all i have to say is if you don  t like it then there is something wrong with you . plus jessica is just all kinds of hot      the only reason you may not like it is because it is set in the future where seattle has gone to hell . that and you my not like it cause the future they show could very well happen .  ,1
the cast although nothing special  all do an ok job  the story seems like a good idea  the script is bearable and the end has quite a good twist so what  s wrong with it   br    br   for a start the special effects are really bad  if this was made in the    s  it might look ok but in     there is just no excuse for visuals as poor as this . it makes me laugh that the dvd cover claims very proudly  from the special effects creator of jeepers creepers  .  br    br   secondly the direction is weak  this film just does not capture the essence of the story  a doctor feeding the hospital inmates souls to the devil  or demon type creature  should be tense or frightening it simply isn  t .  br    br   all in all this is a pretty poor film  and although bearable and at times mildly entertaining  it is still probably best left alone .  br    br   a rather sad      ,0
best of the best   is better than   but just barely . basically  i say this because part  doesn  t contradict parts     like  does    ie . their is no reference to tommy lee having siblings  .  br    br   anyway  i liked the russian plot line of the story  and especially sven ole  thorsen  s bit part as boris . aside from that though and a few fighting scenes  the movie is nothing special . the limited budget is also very noticeable  especially in the airplane blow  up scene  .  br    br   also  part  does not really have a moral or say anything like part  did  there are a couple of more better known actors  hudson  thorsen  in part   but alas nothing like the beginning of the series  and even these characters have very small roles  .  br    br   alas  it seems best of the best is the rhee show  and to be truthful  he cannot carry a movie .  br    br   saw on tape  rating   ,0
hallam foe tells us the story about a boy who lost his mother and experiences some sort of oedepus complex afterward .  br    br   it is something like   minutes long but would be better in ten . there  s like an hour in the middle where he is doing climbing practice on rooftops  and habits in a church tower like quasimodo  only he is much less sympathetic  .  br    br   there  s a strange love story involved which doesn  t have anything to do with anything . she happens to look like his mother  yes so what  we know he misses his mother  that  s what the first ten minutes were about . they should just have put the beginning and ending together and it would have been a o . k . short film . now it  s a portrait of a character who doesn  t change . he is a guy that stuff happens to . the only active choice he has in the whole middle of the movie is to apply for a job .  br    br   there  s this whole oedepus thing going on which is supposed to make us analyze his character . he paints his face  dresses in women  s clothing and wears a dead badger on his head . a badger  you  ve got to see the ending  he returns to his home with the badger on his head  and it is shot like a tacky horror film  to kill his dad  s new wife  which he had sex with in the beginning  . and somehow they thought this wouldn  t be entertaining enough so they put some indie punk music in the background . i  ve got to admit though  i  m kind of allergic to films that want to write a psychological complex on your nose . it feels like this mackenzie director  guy  whatever is trying to show us that he also has been studying psychology in school . you are so smart  thank you for bringing all these forgotten theories back into our memories  you really dug  what a wallraff  okay so now i realized this film is based on some random book  but anyway . .  br    br   photowise it is boring . a lot of talking heads . plus the editor has changed the colors from scene to scene  you know cold and warm etc . . why  maybe  hallam foe  is both a feature and a test film for color blind people . or maybe they just thought that the drama wouldn  t be enough to tell us that he feels lonely  so they increased blue so that we really get it .  br    br   i  m not even gonna comment on the clich indie  oh  how  how  how  cute drawings they have made in the presentation . and all the  cute  sex stuff going on . this whole film is an independent clich . but i do recommend it . i laughed more than a few times . though it is really annoying to be a film student and to see how crap like this gets through the machine .  ,0
i am currently sitting here  forcing myself to finish this . i figure i blew  bux on the vhs  might as well suffer for it . i remember about  or  years ago doing a search on the internet for  war of the worlds  cause of the rumors of the spielberg movie at the time  and i missed the old tv series from the early    s . the website make it out that this was a multi  million dollar budget rendition of the classic book . it was going to be a  perfect translation  . perfect crap is more in tune with this film .  br    br   first off  the video on this movie was glitched  it looked as if i was watching the full motion video from an old mid     s pc or playstation cd  rom video game . sadly enough  the color quality was similar . the acting made shatners classic  dramatic pause  look damn near shakespearean in quality . the cg rendering of various scenes was horrendous  and green screen sequences were worse than those seen in old dukes of hazardd scenes .  br    br   secondly  it is slow and terribly drawn out . i sat thru   minutes of the video  no promo  s at the beginning  before the cylinder actually opened to reveal the first alien . after that  the alien was a terribly constructed cg squid . i am now an hour into it and the most of the alien weaponry i have seen is a spinning silver disk  crappy down even  attached to a mechanical arm . the dramatic scenes are murdered with overly done instrumental  s . the last thing on that  for an alien invasion in the turn of the century      s no one is concerned for their life . it  s like they have no concept . even though media was slow  word of mouth spreads fast and people would have known . the  illusion  of day and night was shoddy at best . simply changing the color around the people to purple  blue or green does not signify night time . perhaps some lighting and actual night time shoots would have given a much better illusion . there is a lot of wasted sequences throughout the film of just watching the  hero  gallop around or walk down silly roads . get on with the film . i know how people get around  you do not need to be so in  depth .  br    br   now  finally an hour and  minutes into the film and they show the alien machines . mighty morphin power rangers had better looking effects . even the skeletons of vaporized humans looked as if animated by a freshman high school computer app class student . the animations do not match up to the scenery at all .  br    br   in closing folks  if you want  the war of the worlds   do one of four things .   watch the     original    watch the early    s tv series    wait for spielberg  s rendition to be released shortly  or   read the frikkin book  something we all probably did in elementary english class  . avoid this movie . it is a waste of your money .  ,0
since douglas macarthur affected more human livesfor the betterthan any other american not elected president  he deserved a better film biography . not that universal  s  macarthur  is bad . it  s just not all it should have been .  br    br   oddly enough  the potential was there . from the very early  star trek  episode  the corbomite maneuver        to the recent hbo films  something the lord made    oo   and  warm springs    oo    director joseph sargent has emerged as one of the most expressively human directors in film  a man capable of subtly shaping the emotional shadings of his actors  performances  and carrying the audience exactly where he wants them to go . the producer  frank mccarthy  also gave us  patton      o   the legendary jerry goldsmith scored both films  and universal widely touted the fact that the film was  four years in preparation and production .  yet for all of this   macarthur  is perfectly adequateand not much more than that .  br    br   the film begins in early      shortly before the beleaguered general was orderedby president franklin d . roosevelt  dan o  herlihy  to flee the philippines to avoid capture by the japanese . thus  this film omits  br    br    macarthur  s birth in    o in a frontier barracks in arkansas still subject to attack by native american tribesmenthus establishing that his remarkable life spanned the distance from bows  and  arrows to thermonuclear weapons  br    br    his graduation from west pointfirst in a class of     br    br    how he joined his famous father  general arthur macarthur  who had earned the medal of honor at missionary ridge in the civil war  on assignments in japan  china and  most importantly  in the philippines  br    br    his heroic exploits in the     excursion into vera cruz  br    br    how he leaped about the trenches of world war one like a mountain goat  often wounded  and promoted with blinding speed to brigadier general  br    br    his postwar service as west point  s youngestand most progressivecommandant  br    br    his participation in the court  martial of billy mitchell in       br    br    his routing of the bonus marchers in       br    br    his efforts to sustain a woefully  underfunded army as chief of staff in the early    o  s  br    br    his retirement from the u . s . army to become field marshal    of the army of the philippines  br    br    and the reactivation of his commission by fdr shortly before the outbreak of the second world war .  br    br   all this is omitted in favor of prolonged footage of macarthur trying to fight off seasickness while being evacuated by pt boatthus  we know that  general mac  is a legend  but not why nor can we appreciate why the allegations of cowardice were so wounding to  dugout doug  and so patently unfounded .  br    br   the remainder of his career is presently straightforwardly his island  hopping  hit  em where they ain  t  campaign  the fulfillment of his pledge to the filipinos  i shall return   his crowning achievement  the winning of the peace in postwar japan  then the difference of opinion with president harry truman  a properly feisty ed flanders  over the conduct of the korean conflict which resulted in his outright firing  and finally  his proclamation to congress that  old soldierssimply fade away   after which he did just that . all quite historically accurate  and all presented with a very deliberate lack of commentary .  br    br   sargent and the producers almost painfully distance themselves from adorning the historical record with their own approval or disapproval if macarthur  s actions appear noble  let them be presented as such if they appear egotistical or bombastic  let those conceptions register sans comment . since joe sargent is quite expert at subtly manipulating his audience  s reactionsagain  see warm springsthis refusal to offer comment appears quite intentional . historically  that may be commendable  but it almost defeats the efforts of the viewer to place this extraordinary man in any kind of rational perspective .  br    br   and finally  there is a sort of  made on the cheap  feel to the film  as there is to  midway   released about the same time . both films were relegated to  television  directors   sargent in this case  jack smight on  midway   and both have a made  for  tv  look . even jerry goldsmith  s march  while perfectly serviceable  lack the subtle undertones and the grandeur of his  patton  theme   just another way in which a larger  than  life man is memorialized by a very ordinary film .  br    br   there was vanity and pettiness in this man  inarguably there was also greatnessand love him or loathe him  one must acknowledge the fact that macarthur did what no military commander before him had done he won the peace .  br    br   in the end   macarthur  like so many film biographiesis a good place to begin research into this remarkable man  but a poor place to end it .  ,1
in the colonies we  re not all that familiar with arthur askey  so i nearly skipped this film  which had its tcm preview recently  on account of the negative comments here on his appearance in  ghost train    which i expected to be thoroughly annoying . instead i was pleasantly surprised to find myself laughing audibly . the physical aspects of askey  s comedy and his timing when delivering a line suggest what you  d get if charlie chaplin and woody allen had a baby . there is no comparing him to bud abbott or any of the other usual purveyors of comic relief who turn up in films of this genre . one can feel  moreover  the thread connecting askey to british comedy   years later at least it is clear from an american point of view that he has more in common with the monty python troupe than with any of his counterparts over here . as for the rest of the film   the more movies you  ve seen  the more likely you  ll guess at the ending  but it is still quite entertaining and atmospheric and worth waiting for its next appearance .  ,1
final score   out of     br    br   possible scene specific spoilers  but who the hell cares    br    br   yes  that  s right zero . and i rarely give   s . even for the lamest of movies i look for things like music  cinematography  imagination  it  s humor  even a good pace to be as objective about the score as possible . looking at it within it  s own genera or subgenera . but there is absolutely nothing redeeming here . i can  t remember another time a movie actually sent me pacing up and down the room when it was over . the only reason i made it to the end was because i couldn  t seem to change the channel  i sat there simply aghast  watching to see what insultingly stupid bit it would come up with next . it was like watching a snake digest a rat .  br    br   but let  s have some fun and pull this baby apart  shall we . first of all  there is nothing technical about  whipped  that works . the visuals are all sitcom style . the cut scenes all just pictures of the street traffic going by at night over and over . the music and score  not only doesn  t contribute anything to the movie  it  s obnoxious . not to mention it doesn  t have anything to contribute to anyway . the acting is as cardboard as it comes  all around and that goes for amanda peet  clearly the  star  that got this train wreck green  lighted  too . these guys  supposedly good friends  have no more chemistry or sense of purpose then if director peter m . cohen had rounded them up at a bus station minutes before shooting .  br    br   on the creative side  there isn  t an original bone in it  s body . it has no imagination . it shows us nothing we haven  t seen a thousand times before . the whole premise  or  twist   of this movie is based on male  bashing and the  idea  that an empowered women can play men  just as they get played  . anybody  that thinks this is somehow a twist or is in any way original has obviously never turned on a tv before . twisted  shallow women are common . male  bashing is the norm . it  s not stealing from anything specifically  it  s worse it  s stealing from clichs . i can  t imagine a women making a movie that depicted other women based so much on stereotypes and with this sense of contempt . makes me want to go rent  in the company of men   or better yet   there  s something about mary  . this movie wants to be a  edgier  version of  there  s something about mary  so bad you can see the sweat .  br    br   the movie has no insights into women  men  dating  sex  or really anything . cohen is simply content to regurgitate myths he has been indoctrinated with from other sexist movies . on the other end  the movie doesn  t work as a satire either  because even though it is ripe with exaggerations one could view as  satirical  it doesn  t have that grounding in reality that satires need . it doesn  t even know what it  s satirizing . then there  s the dialogue  which is little more then the characters screaming obscenities at each other . example character    fk you  character    oh yeah  well fk you   repeat   br    br   and the bottom line  the thing that could excuse all the other discretions there are a lot of movies without plots  without good acting  with morally repulsive characters and obscenity laced dialogue that have been funny and thus  been good .  whipped  ain  t funny . not for a second . it has no comic skills or timing . the situations are all completely phony  not based in any shred of truth  especially enough to wring laughs out of us . the characters all broadly drawn so they will seem relatable to the lowest of the lowest common denominator . just look at  the marquee scene    cult classic  hair gel scene . one of our bumbling anti  heroes opens the medicine cabinet and sees mena  peet   s vibrator . for some reason light shines down on it as if he  s found the holy grail . why cohen thinks men react this way to vibrators i do not know . while he rubs it on himself  he drops it in the toilet and then attempts to fish it out with his bare hands when  oh my  mena walks in on him . oh  my sides .  br    br   but strangely enough  people actually like this movie . of course  people also like  friends  and reality dating shows so i shouldn  t be surprised . all of this has a common thread however .  whipped  is big evidence to me that there is just a huge pocket of people in america that will laugh at any joke just because it is about sex . they will like any show or movie  or think they like it  just because it is about dating or relationships . it  s lack of any quality has no baring on these people . just as people are indoctrinated to want whiter teeth and thinner bodies to sell toothbrushes and weight loss programs  they are also indoctrinated to blindly lap up anything dating  relationship related to sell them cheap  empty  effortless tv  movies and any number of products .  br    br   the only consilation will be that when i die  because i saw this movie  i  ve got a credit to get   minutes of my life back .  br    br    ,0
this film can not even be said to be bad for it is sadly  just painfully mediocre . lacking any real wit or imagination  a thin plot is stretched to the absolute limit and the jokes   which are predictable and threadbare  are spun out to such inordinate length that boredom and yawns quickly overtake the viewer . another notch to mark the sad decline of john waters and a reminder that what shocked  or amused us   years ago doesn  t work quite the same way now . we  ve seen it all before  and it no longer breaks any taboos because they have long since evaporated . a major miss .  ,0
i agree strongly with some of the other critics of this film . i found it incredibly silly  at best  and downright misleading  misinforming and harmful  at worst  . like others  i found this film to be an awful mix of  real  science and pseudoscientific  new age propaganda .  br    br   as a psychologist  i was especially offended by candace pert  s contributions . true  i was not a fan of hers before this film  but her discourse on the  consciousness  of cells was one of the best examples of taking a term   consciousness   that has a predictable meaning to most people and using it in such a distorted manner as to cause it to obscure rather than clarify . it is an old orwellian mind  fk that the master himself described so well in his superb essay  politics and the english language .  to refer to  consciousness  in this manner   indeed  to refer to this film as  based in science  in general  which is its clear intent    is to use language in the same manner employed by stalin when he labeled his slave  states  democratic republics  and hitler when he called his party a  socialist workers  movement .  br    br   i don  t claim to really understand quantum physics . i know enough about it to know that to really understand it would take considerable study . ah  but we americans do love  instant enlightenment   and that  s what this mistake of a film tries to accomplish . if it asked questions  that would be one thing  but it clearly attempts to ask and answer them  which no film could possibly do simply because we are far  far away from the answers  if they indeed exist  .  br    br   by the way  ethically this film needed a disclaimer about the association of several  expert commentators  with the maharishi mahesh yogi  and tm   not to mention j . z . knight  who often speaks in her  ramtha  voice .  i  m always amazed at this channeled       year  old atlantean superman  s grasp of   st century concepts and terminology . but then again  this film argues that the past  present and future are all one and the same  so if ramtha existed in atlantis       years ago  i suppose he could exist now and tomorrow . only  then how come his financial advice has been so incredibly bad for his followers  oh  i forgot  i  m the creator of  good  and  bad  advice  so it  s all my fault  not ramtha  s .   br    br   what a mess .  ,0
what does the marquis de sade have to do with egyptian archaeology and mermaid worshipping cults  tobe hooper tries to answer that question in one weird little film .  br    br   genie is a young cutie who visits her nerdy archaeology father in alexandria  egypt . genie gets caught up with a mysterious hooker  and blatant lesbian  who services daddy on the side . daddy gets sent back to the site  where he uncovers a tomb with what appears to be a mermaid on it . genie meets a descendant of the marquis de sade  and falls for a hunky egyptian  providing the film  s hottest scenes  . eventually  genie finds out she is to be a sacrifice and the protracted and bloody climax gets going . wrapped around this story is footage of the marquis de sade in prison  talking to a portrait of what looks like genie .  br    br   robert englund is terrific as both the marquis and his descendant . his acting abilities have always been sideswiped by his makeup requirements  so he is allowed to shine here . his best performance is still in  killer tongue   if you have not seen that yet .  br    br   the rest of the cast  including young genie  are pretty and average . the script  however  is problematic . you will quickly learn that the marquis scenes are completely unnecessary  except maybe the film makers had access to the cool set . the mermaid cult that eventually saves genie makes no sense whatsoever . who the mermaid is is never explained  and its link to christianity  which is hyped throughout the film  is nothing . the film is very anti  christian  as the archaeologist is a bible spouting father  but likes to be tied up by the local prostitute . there are plenty of scenes of depravity and violence  but hooper probably had little idea of what the screenwriters were trying to say . i know i have no idea .  br    br   so why am i recommending this film  it is weird . there is an extended sex scene . for the ladies  hunky egyptian rides a horse completely nude . englund is marvelous . do you like snakes  this film is full of them . this is like roger corman with a bigger budget . knowing hooper somehow came up with  crocodile  after this is rather sad .  night terrors  is not perfect  but definitely worth a winking  unserious look .  br    br   this is rated  r  for physical violence  some sexual violence  gore  profanity  female nudity  male nudity  sexual content  sexual references  and drug abuse .  br    br    ,1
based on an actual mining disaster  this early german talkie  with english subtitles  still remains one of the most effective docu  dramas ever filmed . featuring many non  professional actors   kameradschaft  gives a chilling view of the friendship that binds the mine workers  regardless of which side of the french  german border they may be from . a deadly accident brings out the very best in everyone  nullifying any superiors  orders . a fellow miner in need will receive the help of his comrades  even at threat of great loss  including life .  br    br   this film reminds of the self  sacrificing heroism shown by the nyfd following the     attacks . putting aside any formal rules and regulations  these men and women in uniform knew only one cause to save lives  and to find their fellow  fire fighters .   more than   years later   kameradschaft  still has the strong and timeless message a friend in need is a friend in deed .  ,1
when the film began  i was shocked to see it was filmed using a cheap video camera  in fact  the camera shakes and looks worse than the average home movie . even direct to dvd films should have production values better than this  heck  a large percentage of the home videos uploaded to youtube have better production values  all too often  the film seriously appears to be made by sticking the camera on a tripod and turning it on   with no camera person  closeups and anything resembling camera  work are absent in some scenes where they might have worked and in others there are too many or poorly framed closeups . yecch   br    br   the film is about two gay men who want to become married . as if was made almost a decade ago  their only option was marrying in vermont   times have definitely changed . however  the recent acceptance of gay marriage cannot in any way be attributed to this film   if anything  it set the gay marriage supporters back instead of helping as the movie stinks and never really tries to seriously address the issue . according to the film  religious people are one  dimensional idiots who carry bibles everywhere and shoot people as well as wives who have gay husbands are narrow  minded when they learn their spouses have been living a lie   go figure . i  m sure glad it gives an honest chance to both sides on the issue   br    br   the bottom line   nothing about the film shows any professionalism at all and i even hesitate to call this a film . it  s more like a home movie and doesn  t even merit a listing on imdb or even inclusion on imdb  s bottom    list of the worst rated films of all time . the acting is horrible  the writing is horrible  the direction  if there even is any  is horrible  the camera  work is horrible and the plot is horrible . it  s a home movie   there is nothing positive i can say about this in any way except that it makes the films of ed wood seem like oscar contenders in comparison and i am sure the ghost of mr . wood is smiling every time someone watches this mess   br    br   i don  t care if you are gay or straight   this film is not worth your time and i don  t know how they managed to create dvds of it . i assume one of the actors burns them on his home computer during his free time  seriously  this gives new meaning to the word  bad    br    br   by the way  if the one lady in the film was a real lawyer  wouldn  t the ability to read be an important prerequisite   i  m just sayin  .  br    br   finally  with gay marriage being such a serious and important topic  can  t we have a film that  s better than this that addresses the issue   this one  sadly  only invites laughter .  ,0
despite  or perhaps in part because of the clever use of music to underscore the motivations and ideologies of each of the major characters  stereotypes are in  and verisimilitude and characterization are out in this not  too  subtle cinematic screed .  br    br   one gets the sense that john singleton was dabbling in post  structuralist literary theory because it was the flavor of the day  and  higher learning  was the tendentious result . the low point of the movie is the  peace  rally  in which the symbols of the     s  free love  movement are reappropriated for what much more closely resembles a  take back the night  rally with live  stridently identity  conscious musical acts in tow . perhaps in his prim revisionism the director was trying to assert that identity politics is the new vietnam  ooh  how adrienne rich of himand remy  s firing into the crowd is a nice touch  if you  re into rich  s sort of political posturing .  br    br   i wish i could give this movie negative stars . i can recommend it only to those interested in the     s as history  a time when radical feminists brought the academic trinity of race  class  and gender to popular culture and declared man  hating  a viable and honorable political option  . where  s camille paglia when you need her   ,0

ben stiller doesn  t so much act as react . and he does it very well . he is very dependent on the comedy going on around him . in there  s something about mary  the stand  up hair scene only works because of stiller trying to keep a straight face . when he confronts mary  s other two suitors  he is the unfunniest guy in the room but the scene is hilarious .  br    br   in along came polly  the formula breaks down for reasons that are difficult to fathom . stiller is surrounded by an array of comic talent . hank azaria and philip seymour hoffman get the best lines  of which there are too few . having said that  hoffman relies a little too much on bodily humour  you know we are in trouble when they go to the fart jokes to raise a laugh . a basketball scene where hoffman hams it up is completely overplayed  though it throws up one predicament in the form of a shirtless opponent that does raise a smile  noticeably through stiller  s reaction  . however  everyone seems to be acting in a bubble  there is very little reaction . hoffman and stiller  s characters could have played off each other much  much more . aniston again reprises her rachael role  but stiller is no ross . it is more of a  joey with a crush on rachael  scenario .  br    br   polly is a by  the  numbers rom  com and that is its failing  it lacks heart . you don  t root for the characters . with a little bit more work we could have had a deeper story  but in the end the film  s failure comes down to poor writing . worth watching if it pops up on tv on a slow night  but you  ll regret forking out cash to see it .  ,0
i won  t go into too much detail about the plot of this movie as other reviewers have covered pretty much the same ground .  br    br   just wanted to say that i really enjoyed the film very much . peter falk  s performance alone is reason enough to watch the film .  br    br   a small scale  road trip  movie with falk  paul reiser in upstate ny in the fall is the setting for most of the action in the film .  br    br   very well written with an adult target audience in mind . plenty of reality based humor  some well played drama give the film a feeling that it could be your own family .  br    br   really can  t say enough about this film except that it  s a damn shame that a lovely movie like this doesn  t get more exposure while other trashy junk out there does .  br    br   it  s great to see falk with a big leading man role again  he makes the most of it . it proves that his famous friend  writer  director john casavettes was right in casting falk in many of his ground breaking films of the   s    s .  ,1
i am decidedly not in the target audience for this film . i am a man nearly   who has only recently stumbled across the world of independent film . this happened quite by accident  with the discovery of a movie called clerks late one night on television . the first two things i noticed about that film were that it was   technically amateurish and   brilliantly written . when i read an interview with the director in the local paper and he said that one of his influences was clerks  i started to get interesting . when he said his main influence was the station agent  a movie i  d seen on dvd a week prior  i decided i had to go and check it out . the result could be described along the same lines as clerks  although the two films are nothing alike content wise . both films suffer from technical gaffes that are overcome through amazing writing . whereas clerks is a day in the life of a man who has nothing in his life at all and is afraid to ask tough questions about himself and his situation  less like me is about a man who seemingly forces himself to be constantly busy  he  s always running one way or another  filling his life with little things so that he will never have to deal with the big ones . the themes and ideas of this film are strong and poignant . i can tell from watching it that not much has changed since i was growing up  young men still have the same problems they always have . the writer dresses up these problems and themes in the modern vernacular  crafts wonderfully honest characters  and has them do completely believable things . as far as indie cinema goes  this may not be perfect from a technical standpoint  but from an artistic one  it is very close .  ,1
mary pickford often stated that tess skinner was her favorite movie role . well said  she played the part twice and for this version which she herself produced  she not only had to purchase the rights from adolph zukor but even give him credit on the film  s main title card . needless to say her portrayal of this role here is most winning . indeed  in my opinion  the movie itself rates as one the all  time great experiences of silent cinema .  br    br   true  director john s . robertson doesn  t move his camera an inch from start to finish  but in robertson  s skillful hands this affectation not only doesn  t matter but is probably more effective . a creative artist of the first rank  robertson is a master of pace  camera angles and montage . he has also drawn brilliantly natural performances from all his players . jean hersholt who enacts the heavy is so hideously repulsive  it  s hard to believe this is the same man as kindly dr christian while lloyd hughes renders one of the best acting jobs of his entire career . true  it  s probably not the way mrs white intended  but it serves the plot admirably  as otherwise we would have difficulty explaining why the dope spent a fortune on defense but made not the slightest attempt to ascertain who actually fired the gun that killed his future brother  in  law  needless to say  this particular quality of the likable hero is downplayed by jack ging in the bowdlerized     version which also totally deletes the author  s trenchant attack on smug  middle  class christianity . notice how the well  washed priest here moves forward a pace or two in surprise at the interruption  but then makes no attempt whatever to assist our plucky little heroine in the performance of duties that he himself was supposedly ordained to administer . this is a very moving scene indeed because it is so realistically presented .  br    br    tess  also provides an insight into the work of another fine actress  gloria hope  whose work was entirely confined to silent cinema . she married lloyd hughes in     and retired in     to devote her life completely to her husband and their two children . lloyd hughes died in      but she lived until      easily contactable in pasadena  but i bet no  one had the brains to interview her . another opportunity lost   br    br   to me  forrest robinson only made a middling impression as skinner . i thought he was slightly miscast and a brief glance at his filmography proves this he usually played priests or judges  but david torrence as usual was superb .  br    br   in all  an expensive production with beautiful photography and marvelous production values .  ,1
busy is so amazing  i just loved every word she has ever done  freaks and geeks  dawson  s creek  white chicks  the smokers . after the first time i saw home room i went and got it the next day . i am a big fan of her and she has a lot of fans here in israel . if someone hasn  t saw is excellent movie than don  t waist more time and go see it now . i recommend to all of you to see all of her movies . i saw busy in the late night show with conan and she was so beautiful and cute i just love her  everybody who saw the movie  in home room she looks very scary but in real life she is so beautiful  you have to see all her half nude pictures for stuff magazine  maxim  she looks so good there  danielle  ,1
if you like animal movies  this movie will please . my wife likes animals and animal movies  she especially like the parrot in this film . it is geared towards kids  but i laughed at most of the humor . the french fashion character made me laugh  and adds balance to the script . it is a disney film  with its sappy  happily  family apeal  but i like leaving the theater with a positive fealing .  ,1
i expected a bad movie  and got a bad movie . but i couldn  t really imagine in my worst fantasy how bad this movie was . i don  t even want to try to explain what blood surf is about . is not about blood surfing  but a big a crocodile . they are complaining about the fake shark in jaws  but spielberg was wise and didn  t show the shark until the end . here the crocodile is shown a lot of times  and it  s the worst fake crocodile i have ever seen  and they don  t try to hide it . if you want to see a good fake crocodile watch lake placid .  br    br   the director had an opportunity to make a decent surf  shark movie  but he had to make a bad b  monster movie . he had the chance to make an original surf movie  but he wanted to make a monster movie . so you have understand how bad this movie is  does it have some good parts  not really  it got some nudity  and a sex scene that is taken straight out of a playboy movie . the acting isn  t half bad either  and kate fischer looks good . too bad she doesn  t take her top off . the lead actors aren  t bad either . they had some potential . the location was beautiful and the movie start good with some nice surf scenes . the blame is on the untalented writer and director . the dialogue is some of the worst i have ever seen  and the script is really badly written  and the director got no talent what so ever  and not much of a fantasy either .  br    br   don  t watch it . even if you want to watch the beautiful kate fischer . it isn  t worth it . watch sirens to watch kate nude  and watch lake placid if you want some good crocodile action .  br    br       because i  m in a good mood  and maureen larrazabal looks good naked  and kate looks good  but is bad actress   and dex miller  joel west and matt borlenghi did a good job with the piece of sht they had to work with .  ,0
i love low budget independent films and had high hopes for this one . but this film is static . never mind the production value  which is very noble for its budget  but the pacing is deadly . admittedly these folks achieve much with little  but the film fails on the most fundamental level . it  s boring . the editing is glacial and the pacing stalls . it should have been   minutes . the best thing about the dr . jekyll is mr . hyde who isn  t seen nearly enough . he had the most dramatic potential . instead we have to suffer through dithering baltimorean  brits stammer through endless and tiresome exposition . it feels like a backwater stage play committed to video .  br    br   noble efforts by everyone in the production  but a story this tired needed a kick in the pants and funky new low budget technology should have given it a fresh voice . instead it  s just a lame retread .  ,0
wow  this movie was so horrible . i  m so glad i didn  t have to pay money to see this horrible movie . it was like a history nut went on a coke binge  the previews of it made it look decent but it was really bad . i will say the idea sounded decent but come on . it was really really bad . if u sat down and thought about it you would also realize it was unrealistic . come on back in the day u think they had all that stuff to work with . it wasn  t like ben franklin sat down one day and made a damn riddle . it was completely ridiculous  and it you want to see a bad movie then by all means go see this one . all and all horrible movie it might actually be on my top   worst films i  ve ever seen .  ,0
what a fun b  movie  shepis is absolutely beautiful and the scarecrow is a distinct and original . he really brought me back to the monsters of the    s . the budget is obviously low and not everybody is pacino behind the lens but it doesn  t matter because it never once takes itself seriously . from the trailer trash redneck to the high flying martial arts moves of the scarecrow  this is truly a b  movie gem . grab some refreshments  snacks and a couple friends and kick back and relax . i enjoyed this film so much i went out a purchased all  scarecrow films . sure  they  re not for everybody but to each his own . sometimes you just have to set the thinking cap down and smile .  ,1
from the opening dialog and scenes  i knew i knew i was in for a train wreck . didn  t want to look  but couldn  t turn away . if it weren  t for the meer eye candy of this film  i would have given one star . the fact that the interaction between characters and relationship behavior were so far fetched  added by poor direction and horrible story make this movie nothing more than a low  budget disaster . money is definitely not a necessity to make a good film . but this movie fails so horribly there was no chance to rebound .  br    br   if you were stuck out in the woods  your childhood best friend dying from an unknown disease  other friends dying around you  stranded in a strange place  what would you do   br    br   a .  run away from everyone and try your luck on your own . b .  have sex with your friends girlfriend . c .  take a hot bath to relax your sorrows to include shaving your legs . d .  bash in the head your childhood best friend and life  long crush with a shovel . e .  all of the above .  br    br   according to eli roth  none of these answers are that far fetched . in fact  all are plausible and well represented in cabin fever . the total lack of reality and illogical attempt at explaining what people would do in traumatic situations throws this film in the bonehead bin at your local rental store . stay away . stay far away .  ,0
i like the good and evil battle . i liked eddie in this movie better than any movie he has ever done . he wasn  t the smart  cocky  know it all he usually plays . he shows heart and a more humble humor . the fact that it shows there are stranger things in heaven and on earth than we can think of gives me hope .  ,1
this was the most visually stunning  moving  amazing and incredible story i  ve ever experienced . quite frankly  even those adjectives just cannot describe it . i can  t just choose one scene that stood out for me . i suppose if i had to list a few it would be the reactions of the fireman to the crashing sound of jumping victims the reaction of people trapped in the elevator  who were unaware of what was going on  as they finally emerge to the horrific scene the shock and disbelief of the onlookers and finally the silence .  br    br   on that day  and even now  i am reminded of star wars       . obi  wan says  i felt a great disturbance in the force  as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced .  it is amazing how it is so accurate in its description . there was truly a disturbance in the force .  br    br   this documentary vividly reveals this disturbance . the feelings are so incredibly visual . the anger  the frustration  the shock  the fear  the exhaustion  and the realization of its very magnitude . it  s all there . not a thing is missed .  br    br   this is a powerful and most moving documentary and well deserving of the emmy . not just because it documents     but because it is simply everything it should be .  br    br   if you plan to watch  be sure to grab a box of tissues . you  ll need them . i know that i did .  ,1
for starters  i didn  t even know about this show since a year or so because of the internet . i have not once seen it on tv before in my country  and a lot of people do not usually know about this show . it is a pity though  because this is easily the most original and clever animation i have witnessed in years .  br    br   i don  t hand out   points a lot  but this is one show that truly deserves all   points . even though at first glance this might seem like a typical cartoon but keep in mind that this is not a kids  show though . when the complete story unfolds itself  you know that this is a real deep storyline  with a spiritual message . this spiritual part of the story is largely based off spirit  animals  a old indian believe that has been preserved for many years . this gives the show a original twist that you can  t often find in animated shows .  br    br   the overall design is also something very different . at times it resembles spawn a bit in terms of gritty design  and other times it takes on a more cartoony approach . i believe david feiss who also created and directed cow and chicken animated a segment in the show  as he also drew that segment in the comic  .  br    br   if you are looking for a mind  twisting show  a show that takes on various subjects such as reality  suicide  spirituality  life  then this is something you should not miss . once you begin watching  you are probably going to watch it to the end . one minor fact may be that the show takes on less material from the comic  but this is not too annoying . the only question remains though  where is the dvd    ,1
begin spoiler fitfully funny and memorable for mr . chong  s literal roach  smoking scene chong coolly mashes a stray kitchen cockroach into his pipe  s bowl  lights up  coughs and hacks violently for a seeming eternity  then with perfect aplomb and not skipping a beat  re  loads the bowl properly  re  lights  re  tokes . end spoiler . alas  i began to lose faith less than half  way through the proceedings . it occurred to me that the lackadaisical duo are way obnoxious and less than relatable . i have come to appreciate the relative sophistication of contemporary stoners  harold and kumar . i simply prefer brighter company . yet  the movie is probably a perfect fit for baked frat bros or those viewers who are so feeble  minded as to be outwitted by a stoner when they   the former are sober . notable guest appearance by paul reubens spouting obscenities in pre  pee  wee form .  ,0
there are no people like  show people  marion davies  as peggy pepper  and william haines  as billy boone  . my introduction to ms . davies was a  clip  from this film the delightfully spoofy one in which she lowers a scarf to reveal different emotions . my introduction to mr . haines was in viewing this film  presently though  it  s possible i  ve seen him in a less memorable role . haines makes an incredible impression  when he joins davies for a commissary meal  tossing his hat into the ring with some wonderful bits at the dining table . indeed  haines and davies deliver great comic performances .  br    br   the story starts off with dell henderson  colonel pepper  driving daughter davies into hollywood  certain she will become tinseltown  s newest sensation . indeed  davies and the already arrived haines become comedy stars . but  davies yearns to become a true drama queen . davies leaves haines  and partners up with the dashingly dramatic paul ralli . but  audiences prefer davies in more comic roles perhaps director king vidor is offering up a case for art imitating life   br    br   full of great hollywood location footage  both on the set  and off . full of great  cameos   at a studio lunch  at the stars  table  davies sits between douglas fairbanks and william s . hart . the best  bit  player  however  is charlie chaplin  who has enough nerve to ask davies for her autograph  while the cameos are fun  they  and the episodic sequences  do help  show people  become less of an important film  and more of an important historical document .  br    br    show people           king vidor  marion davies  william haines  dell henderson  ,1
i used to watch this show when i was a little girl . although i don  t remember much about it  i must say that it was a pretty good show . also  i don  t think i  ve seen every episode . however  if you ask me  it was still a good show . i vaguely remember the theme song . everyone was ideally cast  the costume design was great . the performances were top  grade  too . i just hope some network brings this series back one day so that i  ll be able to see every episode . before i wrap this up  i  d like to say that i  ll always remember this show in my memory forever  even though i don  t think i  ve seen every episode . now  in conclusion  when and if this show is ever brought back on the air  i hope that you catch it one day before it goes off the air for good .  ,1

welcome to our town  welcome to your town  as we are introduced into the worlds of its townsfolk of     america  this three act play is opened before us with the help of  the stage manager   a visual narrator if you like . after his initial introductions  we are lead into the homes of two particular families the webb  s and the gibb  s .  br    br   this is most definitely middle america at the turn of the century  and the progressive way of life of the american dream and its saccharine overtones that can seem a little biased in this dream town . here we see the everyday lives of some of its     populace of grover  s corners  new hampshire  even if there are  too  the migrant polish workers that add another    to is numbers  they  never get a look  in .  br    br   once the daily lives of these families have been introduced wives cooking  children home  working  fathers working  kids falling in love and the clean picket  fences painted white  the second act is started three years later  after young george  a young and unrecognisable william holden  then aged    and emily have fallen in love and intend to marry . blossoming lovebirds reaching for the stars and reaching  too  a turning point in their own lives  from the nest they lived and now  into the anxieties and woes of young adulthood they nervously step . the third act is slightly more sour and foreboding  it is in this act that the movies intentions become apparent  here we see not life  not celebration but death  and it is in this predicament that the dead  as they return to revisit and reconcile their own life past  are here to remind us  to tell us  that life  and every last minute  every precious breath is not to be wasted and squandered .  br    br   it is in this last third that the movies own political stance also seems more apparent too  feeling more of a propaganda stunt on the moral lecturing on  and by  middle america and how it should direct its home and how it should also put it in order . this isn  t just about  our  town  this is moral diction aimed at  our  souls and how america can better itself if its peoples    excluding the poles  the irish  the native american and the freed ethnic minorities   and minorities  in general  plus the supporting backbone of the americana  s who  still  have not had a fair part in this narrative   such as the middle classes  can live up to the expectations of the american dream through honest  decent living . the purveyors of the american dream with special invitation only .  br    br   i was entertained  slightly  by this movie too  but i felt that its narrative held a stronger impact than anything else that took part in it albeit the bland acting  the musical score or how well  or not  it was made . this was the movies intention to exclude other groups  and to only include the likes of the webb  s and the gibb  s  in the future of the developing country of the usa  a good movie  but also a slightly biased in its stance  i thought .  br    br   taken from the play by us  born thornton wilder            this pulitzer prize winning play  and six academy award nominated movie  was the focal point on the perpetual motion of life and its three main attributes life  love and death  the plays translation onto celluloid comes across as a slightly to the right blurb of social consciousness . our town starts off with what seems a lesson in pointlessness  like other towns  nothing too exciting ever happens here  if anything at all  this town only has the  right sort of people   you can still leave your back  door unlocked here  we are seeing the developing lives of these two families  but it is their moral and social stance that is more important than them themselves . our town may just have been  any town   just as long as you came from the right part of town that is .  ,0
ok  so the fx are not high budget . but this story is based on actual events . not something thrown together to make a couple of rich actors  even richer   as most movies that are based on books  there are somethings that just don  t fit . only a couple of people have stated that this movie was based on real events  not a knock  off as most people believe it is   this movie is in no way related too twister  other than both movies are about tornadoes .  br    br   for those of you who have problems with the science of the tornadoes and storms in the movie  there are a couple of things you need to remember . . . the actual  night of the twisters  was june       . so this movie was released   years after the actual events . try think how far storm research has advanced in that time . it happened in a larger town grand island  nebraska is the third largest city in the state . even though the movie calls the town something else  and says it  s a small town . for the real story check out http   www . gitwisters . com   ,1
knowing what to expect  on the whole  from a denzel washington performance  quality  integrity  gravitas  wry humour  will prepare you for what to expect from his directorial debut . much like robert de niro  s a bronx tale  antwone fisher delivers the moving drama of the life of a young man and the effects of key figures in his life . much as in a bronx tale de niro played one of these key figures to the lead character  himself a character was born to play but was too old too  washington takes a similar role in this as the fatherly councellor to the titular character  a character that seems like he should be played by a washington from   years ago . be thankful washington is too old to play antwone because if he had we would firstly be deprived of the wonderfully measured and intelligently nuanced performance he gives as the navy councellor . however more importantly we wouldn  t get to see the superb  we can only hope star making  turn from derek luke in the title role . inevitably the character comes across as moulded in washington  s shape  however you get the impression this is not just because washington directed it  not that luke was trying to copy him  but that luke is as genuinely powerful and thought provoking an actor as washington . it took far too long for washington to receive the academy award he deserved for malcolm x  philadelphia  devil in a blue dress and the hurricane  let us hope that luke does not have to wait so long . also a great piece of casting was joy bryant as fisher  s girlfriend  cheryl . while the part could have been a forgettable support or a standard  girlfriend  role bryant imbues it with life . tender and intelligent the role transcends stereotyping with bryant inhabiting it  and she makes the part significant and interesting . it doesn  t hurt either that bryant is possibly the most attractive woman you  ll see on celluloid this year  the smile alone could thaw the coldest heart . acting ability and looks  why isn  t this woman in everything being made right now . providing good support in a small role in salli richardson as washington  s wife berta . saying more with a silence or look than many hollywood actresses can manage in an entire film she informs the audience of the entire storylines long before any exposition occurs . as for washington  s directing  as i said  it is the directing equivalent of his acting . taking the story of a man few viewers will have heard of and making it genuinely interesting is a difficult feat which washington achieves with aplomb . the film is neither rushed nor showy  but it never feels slow or dull . it is measured and nuanced  balancing the humour and drama perfectly . antwone fisher may not blow you away if you like big  explosive  plotless hollywood films but for those who appreciate a finely crafted character piece  with excellent performances and steady well handled direction  this is for you .  ,1
why has this not been released  i kind of thought it must be a bit rubbish since it hasn  t been . how wrong can a girl be  this film is  in a word  enthralling .  br    br   you will be captivated . it holds your attention from the start and its pace never slows .  br    br   the final part of the film  the  episode  as it were  not giving anything away  you saw that in the trailer  is also unmissable . you will chose a favourite  you will be shocked  you wont be able to go and make a cup of coffee because you need to find out what happens . the adrenalin rises and you cant not watch . cudos to the actors  it  s very believable . and it doesn  t stop there  they have a final shock for you .  br    br   it also makes you question reality tv and if you would watch . and how far away from this are we  really  endemol  who make big brother  made a tv show in holland last year offering a dying woman  s kidney to patients in need of a transplant . the show was revealed at the end to be a hoax  ostensibly to raise awareness of organ donation  but are we getting too close for comfort   ,1
i took part in a little mini production of this when i was a bout  at school and my mum bought the video for me . i  ve loved it ever since   when i was younger  it was the songs and spectacular dance sequences that i enjoyed but since i  ve watched it when i got older  i appreciate more the fantastic acting and character portrayal . oliver reed and ron moody were brilliant . i can  t imagine anyone else playing bill sykes or fagin . shani wallis  nancy if the best character for me . she put up with so much for those boys  i think she  s such a strong character and her final scene when . . . well  you know . . . always makes me cry  best musical in my opinion of all time . it  s lasted all this time  it will live on for many more years to come          ,1
caught part of george  on tv recently  but couldn  t get myself to watch it through to the end . just awful  i can  t even remember the plot . all i know is that george and ursula were not the george and ursula of the first movie  which was bad enough . there  s a lot of scrambling around  but the direction and editing were so shoddy and choppy  it was like watching outtakes or deleted scenes . having the original voice of ape the ape back was not nearly enough to make me warm up to this . george  is probably the single worst sequel i have ever seen  and that is saying something . jeez  because of imdb  s   lines rule  i have to keep typing when i have nothing more to say about this crapulastic made  for  tv sequel . disney  hang your head in shame .  ,0
writer  director bart sibrel bases his work here around a can of film that he says was mistakenly sent to him by nasa . he says it shows the astronauts faking the television footage of their trip to the moon by employing camera tricks . the astronauts were in low earth orbit all the time  and editors on the ground composed this raw footage into just a few seconds of finished film .  br    br   unfortunately sibrel  s research is so slipshod that he doesn  t realize his  backstage  footage is really taken in large part from the    minute live telecast  also on that reel  that was seen by millions  not hidden away in nasa vaults as he implies . and we have to wonder why sibrel puts his own conspiratorial narration over the astronauts  audio in the footage  because hearing the astronauts in their own words clearly spells out that the astronauts were just testing the camera  not faking footage .  br    br   finally  anyone can see the raw footage for themselves without having to buy sibrel  s hacked  up version of it .  he shows you more of the zapruder film of jfk  s assassination than of his  smoking gun  .  sibrel thinks he  s the only one who  s seen it . what  s more revealing is the clips from that raw footage that sibrel chose not to use  such as those clearly showing the appropriately distant earth being eclipsed by the window frames and so forth  destroying his claim that mattes and transparencies were placed in the spacecraft windows to create the illusion of a faraway earth .  br    br   as with most films of this type  sibrel relies on innuendo  inexpert assumption  misleading commentary  and selective quotation to manipulate the viewer into accepting a conclusion for which there is not a shred of actual evidence .  ,0
why such a generic title  santa claus    so bland and unpredictable . movies before that tried to cash in on the holiday spirit  most notably  santa claus conquers the martians   at least was entertaining to watch because of the campiness to it  and all the stock footage being used . . . for some reason  that seemed happy to me . but this movie just screws christmas in the butt  and screws the joy of all the kids . santa lives in space  his enemy is a devil named pitch  santa gets help from merlin the magician  how random is this   well  since it was made in mexico then some of you might understand the way of how the film was made . i had to admit some of the effects were just wacky for the time . it was a all  out cluster of madness  though  despite all the troubles with the movie  it still feels like a christmas movie . good conquers evil  and christmas still plays a part of our hearts of every good girl or boy in the world  or possibly universe  thanks to santa claus conquers the martians . . apparently . so  i think you should give it a try  even if it is one of the worst holiday movies of all time . . . though it should put a smile on your face any day .  ,0
umm . . i was quite surprised that someone actually gave this film high marks .  br    br   lets face it . . . tori spelling is not a great actress . . and this movie just proves the extent of her  talent  . the movie  s plot was weak . . . i bet the dork that came up with this concept was some perverted peeping tom . if there is a good thing about this movie  i would say it  s that tommy chong  s daughter  just for the fact that she  s his daughter . . . and then there is that soap  opera  ish male lead who  s decent good looks somewhat make him attractive  but ceases to help his dramatic abilities . why does imdb require at least   lines  how many more ways can you simply say  this movie sucks    ,0
it is like what the title of this thread say . only impression i got from that movie is that marlee matlin  s character was always angry  so cynical  and so pathetic . her character  s first date with william hurt  s character where they were dancing were dumb . all in all  i  ve tried to finish watching the movie four times  and of all four times i fell asleep . i would keep watching that movie with one intention . . . to beat my problem with insomnia  because all it do is to put me to sleep . sweet dream .  ,0
i  d always wanted david duchovney to go into the movie business  and finally he did  and he made me proud . this movie lived up to what i had hoped for . duchovney played his character very well  managing to remain consistent with something new  instead of playing the agent molder we are used to . therefore  i give him extra credit for his role  also because i could not see anyone else playing that particular character . david was great  but nothing compared to the psychotic timothy hutton . a brilliant performance that you don  t get tired of throughout the movie  because he never fails to surprise you . he has weaknesses  and strengths  making the story all the more believable . i also very much enjoyed the narration  it added to the story a good deal  and had some very memorable quotes that i still use to all the time . this movie also had a wounderfull score . i recomend this for anyone who likes drama  and doesn  t mind blood .  ,1
ok  first of all  steve irwin  rest in peace . you were loved by many fans . now . . . this movie wasn  t a movie at all . it was  the crocodile hunter  tv program with bad acting  bad scripts  and bad directing in between steve capturing or teaching us about animals . he was entertaining as an animal seeker  specialist . millions will miss him . but the whole movie idea was a big mistake . the plot was so broken  it was almost non  existent . casting was horrible . the acting wasn  t even worth elementary school  level actors . the direction must be faulted as well . if you can  t get a half  way decent performance out of your actors  no matter how bad the script is  you must not be that good in the first place . i could have written a better script . i wish i had never been to see this movie . of course  i watched it for      .   for me    .   for my son .  while out with friends who insisted upon seeing this instead of scooby doo live action . my son  who is not so discriminating  liked the movie alright  but he still has never asked to see it again . if you want fond memories of steve irwin  buy his series on dvd . avoid this movie like the plague . if i were steve  i know i wouldn  t want to be remembered for this movie . respect him avoid this movie   ,0
this movie is easily the worst of the series . though new line might just be looking at sales  they all know the only reason this one made more money than the one prior was due to its  d ending . it wasn  t that the   d was good either  because it was    s  d with the red and blue lenses  anaglyph .  it was just the fact that people wanted to see what it would look like . beyond that this movie was so poorly done  bad script  bad characters  bad acting  worse directing . this movie is trying to push the camp factor almost to the point of being like a  looney tunes  episode .  br    br   seriously  not for horror audience  because it is corny and not scary  and not funny or amusing for comedy crowds . just a total mess with some really bad cameos that are still trying to play this whole thing as camp and having it fall way short of what they probably wanted .  br    br   i remember most of us who had been fans of this series were just praying that it would end at this point because of how bad it had gotten . this is one of the movies that helped take horror out of popularity and ride a fad of belief that audiences really wanted to laugh with some stupid comedy than see a good and scary horror film .  ,0
