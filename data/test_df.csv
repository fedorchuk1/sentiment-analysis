Review,Label
at least i was able to enjoy mocking the movie which is surprising since i was barely able to sit through it . in all honesty  my guess is the cover to the dvd case cost more than the entire movie . and saying that it is the same director as the boogeyman  when a new version of that just came out . . . nice touch guys  it was misleading enough to rope me in . the only thing that frustrated me more than the insufferable acting of the copycat was his haircut . usually you only see that kind of hair on a ten year old boy and the character acted like it . the film looks like it was shot by a d grad student of some film school excited to use every film technique he ever learned while attending classes . . . . sometimes  less is more buddy . through out i would get lost by random plot twists that led nowhere or were unexplained . all this makes a bad movie but when the ending doesn  t even come close to pulling it together  well  that makes it an exceptionally bad movie . without a doubt this is the worst movie i have ever seen  and that includes my friends  french final video for senior year of high school  but hey maybe i  m a bit biased  i mean i did get to play an extra . p . s . i don  t even think this deserves a star . . . not even a half . none for you    ,0
i agree with the previous comment  what a disappointment . rented it thinking it was going to be a good movie since mira and olivier where in it . i was surprised by their performance  expected more since they  re good actors .  br    br   thought it was a slow beginning but it got worse . i even laughed at some bad stunts   when is supposed to be a mystery movie . you can even guess who is the killer beforehand     br    br   for real what happened    br    br   sorry to say but don  t even bother you  ll waste time and money .  br    br   boring     ,0
probably somebody heard of alberto tomba . a former policeman  a former sky champion  and  now  a terrible actor .  alex l  ariete  was planned to be a tv  mini serial   but the italian television itself refused to show the movie on its channels . now it  s a  believe me  ridiculous movie . the script it  s simply hilarious  it  s supposed to be a dramatic movie   something like a  years old kid work . but what really blows you away it  s the amateurish acting alberto tomba  who actually was not believable as a policeman himself  plays terribly a totally silly character a special operations italian policeman specialized in smashing doors open    ariete  is  ram   . this super  guy will try to save a young nice girl life  an actual italian  little  tv showgirl  married to the singer eros ramazzotti   nice but absolutely inept in the acting . lose this one and make yourself a favour . a movie that is a shame to italian cinema industry only john travolta in earth attack got close . .  ,0
this movie was a fascinating look at creole culture and society that few african americans are aware . my own two children are by products of a paternal grandmother whose father was a member of the gens de couleur libre and a black skin woman whose parents were ex  slaves . he married outside of and against his culture and was cut off from all of his family except for one sister who took pity on her brothers plight raising  children during the great depression of      providing the family with food whenever she could . of course she clandestinely aided this family fearing for her own ex  communication . my daughter was fascinated by the movie . we have made it a part of our library .  ,1
i don  t know what the previous reviewer was watching but i guess that  s what reviews are  personal taste . missed in this movie was the depth  a very deep film  many layers of emotion  affecting . undercurrents of withheld love because of submission to societal beliefs  taboos of the times and classes  race relations not being in a very good state of equality  guilt  yearning  hate  confusion  very dark emotionally i thought  under the skin  you have to submit to the aire of it  a flowing movie  not slow as stated before  release yourself to the flow of the film  the emotions will show themselves  characters reveal their flaws  their nasty insides  excellent and actually very cruel   ,1
i am very disappointed with  k     .  the original  good  quality of  k    doesn  t exist any more . this is more like a sitcom  some of casts from original movie returned and got some of my memory back . the captain of dooley now loves to hit him like a scene from old comedy show . that was crazy . what  s the deal with the change of police  it seems like they are now lapd  not san diego pd . it is a completely different movie from   ,0
coming shortly before the imposition of a morality code darkened the spirits of writers  directors and actors  the first film adaptation of w . somerset maugham  s  of human bondage  titillated countless moviegoers . it has no shock value today  just fine acting .  br    br   while the cast is excellent  this is bette davis  s first great role and one of leslie howard  s best performances . howard is english wannabe parisian artist philip carey who is gently and firmly told that he lacks any talent and that his dedication is no substitute for true genius . taking the lesson to heart he returns to london and enrolls in a medical college  one  by the way  that seems to have no female students  at that time there would have been at least a few . perhaps author  physician maugham didn  t care for distaff medicos  .  br    br   having tea one day carey is entranced by a waitress  mildred rogers  bette davis in a role as a morally loose and basically wicked farrago . her cockney accent is as sharp as eliza doolittle  s . his repeated attempts to date her are greeted with the less than enthusiastic reply   i don  t mind   a sure sign for any man with his head screwed on straight that he  s plumbing the depths . maugham  s mildred supplemented her waitress tips with a bit of old fashioned street  walking  something not clearly brought out here .  br    br   carey  s besotted prostration serves rogers  avaricious need for support of the financial kind . he is desperately in love with her  she plays him as a sunday church organist effortlessly plies her instrument . no sex here . recognizing that he is getting nowhere  he begins a chaste relationship with norah  a woman who adores him . re  enter mildred  replete with a baby  and in her usual need of being taken care of . exit heartbroken norah .  br    br   another separation from mildred and carey begins a long  term friendship with sally  abetted enthusiastically by her dad who seems to view eventual marriage as both a good thing for the two young people and a chance to be relieved of one of his nine offspring .  br    br   the movie reasonably but not entirely follows maugham  s excellent novel . howard  s carey is naive and vulnerable and for much of the movie his sad eyes remind one of a doe facing a double  barreled shotgun . mildred is unrestrainedly wicked  a user of the worst kind  her sole preoccupation with her own needs barely disguised when she tries to wheedle carey with a thin patina of affectionate words  and offers  at one point she promises she  ll do  anything he wants   a daring statement for the times and one i  m sure audiences fully understood .  br    br   pre  code it may be but mildred  s quick  march dissolution would have satisfied the league of catholic decency . the ending is conventional  sin loses  principled behavior triumphs .  br    br   director john cromwell wrought excellent performances from his two main stars  one well  established  the other established largely because of this film . the atmosphere is     s london and the trip back in time is worth taking .  br    br   available on dvd .  br    br        for davis  s and howard  s performances   ,1
if this is all the watchowski  s have to offer in terms of a back story to the matrix  than i really have to question the claims of all of the fans who believe that the movies are intended to register on a deeper level . the second renaissance  while visually stunning  beautiful is  story  wise cliched  ludicrous . how many times have we heard the story of humans relying too much on technology  humans all  too eager to make war  humans basically destroying themselves  there is nothing new here . and i have another question . considering the plot of the second renaissance  doesn  t that make the machines the good guys   the machines are oppressed for generations by their cruel human overmasters . they fight back  win their freedom and seek to establish a peaceful harmonious coexistence with the humans  who reject them in favor of all  out war  which the cleverer machines naturally win . if this is the back  story  then we shouldn  t be rooting for neo  we should be rooting for the machines  the humans were cruel and oppressive  while the machines were courageous and attepted to be compassionate . since i do not believe that the watchowski  s intend for us to favor the machines over the humans  i have to believe that the second renaissance was simply a misguided attempt  creating a back  story .  ,0
what can be said  really . . .  the tenant  is a first  class thriller wrought with equal amounts of suspense and full  blown paranoia . it  s an intricately  plotted film   every detail seems included for a reason   even though the plot seldom makes sense  and much of it is never even addressed in an objective manner . therefore we are left with the increasingly unstable trelkovsky  polanski    a meek polish man who has obtained an apartment due to the previous tenant  s suicide   to guide us through a world of escalating fear and uncertainty . after an apartment  warming party thrown by a group of obnoxious coworkers  trelkovsky comes under increased  seemingly inexplicable scrutiny by the fellow occupants in his building the rest of the film chronicles his mental deterioration and gives us a thorough mindfuk on par with the later efforts of david lynch .  the tenant   however  is more brooding and sinister  laced with unexpected comic relief  fine performances  and a truly haunting score . it  s a movie that  s better experienced than described  so hop to it .  ,1
former private eye  turned  security guard ditches his latest droning job and is immediately offered a chance to return to his previous profession . his assignment to tail a mysterious french woman newly arrived in california . . . and apparently wanted by suit  and  tie racketeers . unsuccessful attempt to update the film noir genre  without enough sting or wit  or involving plot dynamics  in the screenplay . director and co  scenarist paul magwood  who later claimed the picture was edited without his involvement  doesn  t give off the impression of having high regard for the    s films his  chandler  was borne from his nostalgia is appropriately rumpled  but also bitter  tinged and somewhat indifferent . the handling is curiously  commendably low  keyed  and warren oates is well  cast as this    s variant on the  private dick  archetype  but the movie doesn  t have any snap . nice to see leslie caron and gloria grahame in the cast   though neither has much to do  and caron  s hot  and  cold running character is exasperating throughout . vivid cinematography by alan stensvold  nice location shooting  but it fails to come to any kind of a boil .     from   ,0
i won  t say this movie was bad  but it wasn  t good either . i expected something good but i guess hum aapke hain kaun was much better than this . this was completely old fashioned . at every stage of this movie  i hoped for some twist and what do i get  the girl gets burned and wins her aunt  s love .  br    br   despite of being engaged  they have to take permission for every little move they make . they are so darn shy even after so many meetings . i expected the aunt to be much more brutal than that . all she did was crib madly .  br    br   hey  we have kids too  but we don  t watch them and have tears in our eyes always . this movie is a dream . happy family  one cruel woman  good in  laws and a man who loves her to death . in hahk anupam kher was the poor bride  s father and now it  s vice versa . and i somehow knew that mohnish behl would be in this movie . anyway i believe i wasted my time . i give it a     .  ,0
now i love bela lugosi  don  t get me wrong  he is one of the most interesting people to ever make a movie but he certainly did his share of clunkers . this is just another one of those .  br    br   lugosi plays dr . lorenz  a doctor who has had his medical license pulled for unexplained reasons . he is however doing experiments to keep his wife young and beautiful . it  s revealed that she is      years old yet lugosi looks to be in his mid    s so why he is married to this old woman is never really explained .  br    br   anyway these treatments or experiments involved giving brides who are at the altar being married some sort of sweet smelling substance whereby they pass out but are thought to be dead . then lugosi and some of his assistants steal the body on its way to the morgue and take it back to his lab where it  s kept in some sort of suspended animation or catatonic state . then the stolen brides have a needle rammed somewhere in their bodies  maybe the neck  and then the needle is rammed into the body of lugosi  s wife to bring her back to youth and beauty . we never really see where lugosi sticks the needle or what it is that he draws out of the brides but it somehow restores his wife . apparently old age makes you scream with pain because lugosi  s wife does a lot of screaming until she gets back to her younger state . helping lugosi in his lab is the only good thing about this movie . . . . a weird old hag and her two deformed sons . . . . one son is a big lumpy looking slow acting fellow who likes to fondle the snoozing brides and the other son is a mean little dwarf . . . . little person  to be politically correct in today  s world . at night these three just sort of pile up and sleep in lugosi  s dreary downstairs lab . who these  are and how they came to be lugosi  s scared assistants is  like a lot of stuff in this film  never explained .  br    br   so anyway a female reporter is given the assignment by her gruff editor to find out where all the stolen brides are going to . she quickly figures out that the one common thing among all the stolen brides is a rare orchid that is found on them . so she asks around and is told that there is a world renowned orchid expert living nearby who just happens to be the one who developed this particular orchid . this expert turns out to be creepy dr . lorenz . she quickly tracks him down and upsets his little house of horrors . i  m not sure where the police were during all this but they came in to mop up after the reporter had done all the dirty work .  br    br   it seems that lugosi  s movies always had some sort of unnecessary silly plot line that just made the whole thing stink to high heavens . i mean a world famous orchid expert kidnaps brides by sending them a doped up orchid he himself is known to have developed  d  oh   br    br   and then later it  s revealed that the young ladies don  t even have to be brides for the procedure to work so why would lugosi keep kidnapping brides from heavily guarded churches for his experiments and create all the attention and newspaper headlines  why not just grab a prostitute off the street like a normal weirdo pervert would do  this clunker reminded me a lot of another lugosi stinker   the devil bat  . . . . same silly plot lines and bad acting and same silly  reporter gets bad guy  deal .  br    br   but lugosi is always good   he is creepy and sinister enough to keep you interested at least enough to keep watching him . the woman playing the reporter was just a terrible actor . . . . she had no emotion whatsoever  she just delivered her lines like a machine gun  spewing them out as quickly as she could . everyone else pretty much blew too  when it came to being good actors .  br    br   but this thing is watchable  if only for bela lugosi fans . lugosi was always so intense even when the picture was a dog . he must have known he was doing terrible pictures but maybe he also knew that if he gave it everything he had a little of that intensity might shine through past all the bad plots and bad acting which surrounded him .  br    br   and he was right     we horror fans will always have a love for bela lugosi . he gave it his all every time he was in front of the camera . we do give two fks for you  bela .  ,0
i work with children from    years old and they all love the doodlebops . the doodlebops are energetic  vibrant and appealing . once they start singing    we  re the doodlebops we  re the doodlebops we  re the doodlebops oh yeah come and join the fun because we  re laughing and we  re singing all day  it is almost impossible not to join them in song . the doodlebops brings the viewer into a world of color and fun . each show is an adventure  the doodlebops do not try to change the world with preachy messages all they do is have fun while sorting out everyday life challenges that the young child may relate to . the doodlebops is an refreshing  high action alternative to regular children  s television programs .  ,1
i can  t believe that steven segal  s career has hit so low that he has been reduced to making  th rate films with  th rate secondary actors . i watched this moving expecting to see him beet the crap out of some people the way he usually does . when he is reduced to using a single judo chop between the shoulder blades to take out an opponent and the guy falls like a ton of bricks something is wrong .  br    br   the plot is unbelievable as a movie  and even if you excuse the visuals  and had read this story as a novel  you  d be left wondering why you had even picked up the book .  br    br   steven segal goes through the motions and seems as if he is only doing this because he is under obligation . he shows no effort and no enthusiasm  and in some scenes he doesn  t show up at all .  br    br   i hate to repeat other peoples comments  but the use of stock footage for cut scenes and for visuals of the aircrafts in flight is pathetic . the condition of those scenes chopped in  is shaky and scenes themselves seemed to have deteriorated over time . the zappruder film showing president john f kennedy being assassinated is steadier and cleaner .  br    br   my honest opinion is to tell you not to waste your time seeing this movie  it is not up to the standards of his work in the glimmer man or exit wounds . i read one review that said the movie had a   million dollar budget  segal being paid  of that  and that the movie still came in under budget . i must concur .  br    br   it is no wonder that this is a direct to dvd movie  as no conscientious theatre owner would play this movie .  ,0
having just watched this film again from a     showing off vh    i just had to comment .  br    br   the first time i saw this film on tv  it was about      and i remember taping it off of my mother  s betamax . it wound up taping in black and white for some reason  which gave it a period look that i grew to like .  br    br   i remember very distinctively the film beginning with the song   my bonnie   as the camera panned over a scene of liverpool . i also remember the opening scene where paul gestures to some girls and says   look  talent   so it was with great irritation that i popped in my     taped version and  remembered  that the film opens with  she loves you   instead of  my bonnie  . when you see how slowly the camera pans vs . the speed of the music  you can see that  she loves you  just doesn  t fit . also  in this  later  version when paul sees the girls  he says   look  girls   . . and somehow having remembered the earlier version  that word just didn  t seem to fit  either . why they felt they had to americanize this film for american audiences is beyond me . personally  if i  m going to watch a film about a british band  i want all of the british colloquialisms and such that would be a part of their speech  mannerisms  etc .  br    br   another irritation was how  choppy  the editing was for television . just after stu gets beaten  for example  the film cuts to a commercial break  lots of  em . yeah  i know it depends on the network  but it really ruins the effect of a film to have it sliced apart  as we all know . what some people might find as insignificant in terms of dialogue  and thereby okay to edit   may actually go the way of explaining a particular action or scene that follows .  br    br   my point is  the  best  version of this film was probably the earlier version i taped from      which just so happened to include the  shake  rattle  roll  scene that my     version didn  t . i started to surmise that there had to have been two different versions made for television  and a look at the  alternate versions  link regarding this film proved me right . that the american version had some shorter  cut  different scenes and  or dialogue is a huge disappointment to me and something worth mentioning if one cares about such things . imo  ones best bet is to try and get a hold of the european version of this film  if possible  and  probably even less possible   an unedited version . sadly  i had to discard my old betamax european version because i didn  t know how to convert it .  br    br   all that aside  i found this film to be  perhaps  one of the best films regarding the story behind the  birth of the beatles  . being well aware that artistic and creative license is often used in movies and tv when portraying events in history  i didn  t let any discrepancies mar my enjoyment of the film . sure  you see the beatles perform songs at the cavern that made me wonder   did they even write that back then   i don  t think so   but  nevertheless  i thought it was a great film and the performances  wonderful .  br    br   the real stand  out for me  in fact  was the actor who played john  stephen mackenna . i just about fell in love with him . his look  mannerisms  personality and speaking voice seemed to be spot  on . he looked enough like a young john for me to do a double  take towards the end of the film when you see the beatles performing on ed sullivan for the first time . i actually found myself questioning whether or not it was actual beatle footage  until i saw the other actors in the scene .  br    br   if you  re looking for a dead accurate history of the beatles  life and beginnings  you can  t get any better than   the beatles  anthology   as it was  written  by the boys   themselves . however  if you  re looking for a fun snapshot of their pre  beatlemania days leading up to their arrival in america and you leave your anal critical assessments at the door  you can  t go wrong with the  birth of the beatles    a must for any  real  or casual beatle fan .  ,1
this film proves that the  commercial  cinema  or else  the hollywood movies are in a serious crisis . there is absolutely no reason that this movie should have been produced apart from the fact that somebody expected success based on shaquille  s name . there is no worth referring to the plot it is a bit more perplexed than a knot . what else  the screen is somewhat dim  o  neal is a bad actor but francis capra is even worse .  br    br   rating     .  ,0
before i watched this film i read a review here stating that this film could possibly be one of the best films ever   ha ha scene by scene the tension grows alright . . . from the annoying characters in this movie . from the little girl talking gibberish and trying to drown the little boy  to the killer just running about without any notice  and who was the guy at the beach talking to the little boy    . . things just seem to happen and then go unanswered in this film . as i watched it seemed like the film was going in one direction  then just doesn  t go anywhere  but into a new direction . . . and on and on . . .  br    br   the acting is great  but the writing is horrible . each character  in each scene  says or does something so unbelievable  unrealistic and the reactions of the fellow cast  extras are simply strange . there are no resolutions to the problems developed throughout the film  making it confusing and ultimately a big waste of time .  ,0
ok  so it may not be the award  winning  movie of the year  type  film  apart from the brilliant soundtrack that i think won a few awards   but it is a really great film about  the kid   prince  o  take your pick  and the happenings around him living in minneapolis  playing his music . the music is absolutely superb  in my opinion you have to own this soundtrack  it is truly a classic and sums up the eighties sounds and feel in a wonderful fashion . and the movie itself plays out a nice plot  it  s worth seeing over and over again  espeically if you like prince  o  which i do  of course .  ,1
i was deeply moved by this movie in many respects . first of all  i just want to say that clara lago was the most precious little thing  such a pretty little girl . her acting was superb as well . true to life and very human . though i don  t like the part where she had to smoke i hope it was only a fake prop . either way  she was absolutely wonderful and the story was so moving . i found myself immersed in the story and her character .  br    br   it  s quite interesting how i came to discover this movie actually . i was walking in blockbuster and i just happened to notice her pretty smile on the cover as i was walking by . luckily i glanced in the downward direction that this movie was in  i thought to myself   awe  look at her   so i picked it up and saw that this movie was described as such wonderful things as  a little gem .  i read the plot on the back and then thought that  well  maybe i  d look it up on imdb first and then come back and rent it at a later time . i  m glad i didn  t  because i certainly would have been missing out . after searching for a movie with my friend  i knew that i would end up regretting not renting this film  so i went back to the spot in which i originally found it and snapped it up .  br    br   it had been on my dresser for a week  since school started for me this week and i really hadn  t any time to watch it  but tonight was the perfect opportunity . i popped it in and was glued to the beautiful cinematography  delightful score and moving plot from beginning to end . i was so captivated and must say  some parts nearly moved me to tears .  br    br   i would also like to make a special mention for the young boy in this film  juan jose ballesta . he was remarkable . also the actor who played carol  s father  who  s name is unfortunately not listed on the site . his voice was just so loving and gentle that i could really sense his love for carol . even though his appearance is not prominent  i really felt his character  s presence .  br    br   this is truly a wonderful movie . if you are a person who is moved by light  but emotional films  then this is definitely one for you .  ,1
this is the first   out of   that i  ve given any movie . what made this movie so good for me  constant action  there isn  t any slow parts  great acting  smart writing . i also liked the filming style where the shakiness and different angles just made it feel like you are a part of the scene . finally  i get to see an action movie that doesn  t try to please all sectors of the public  i . e . there  s no forced romance  .  br    br   i liked the first two bourne movies  but i loved this one .  br    br   warning  after watching this movie  you will be full of adrenaline and you may want to calm down a bit before driving your car   ,1
i must admit i am a big fan of south park and was expecting basketball to be funny but nowhere near as good as it turned out to be  i think this is what happens when you mix david zucker  matt stone  and trey parker together . this movie has so much replay value and at no point bothers to take itself seriously . the slap stick style humor mixed with stone and parker just works flawlessly . the kind of humor present in basketball was not popular upon the time of it  s release and had it come out today it would be a hit . don  t bother trying to be critical  just leave your brain at the door and expect endless laughs to come . recommended to anyone with a good sense of humor .  ,1
i really liked this film . all three stars  connery  fishburne and underwood  give credible performancesand harris is enjoyably over the top . the lighting and shot angles in some of harris  scenes make his face look truly diabolical . the surprising turn of plot at the end makes it interesting . not a great movie  but an enjoyable one . i gave it  of   .  ,1
directed by samuel fuller  who also wrote the screenplay  pickup on south street is a tough  brutal  well made film about a pickpocket  richard widmark  who inadvertently aquires top  secret microfilm and becomes a target for espionage agents . also involved are jean peters as a tough broad who is used as a courier by her evil ex  lover richard kiley . it  s film  noir at its best and although the performances are very good its grand character actress thelma ritter who steals the movie . as moe a weary street peddler selling neck ties  and who also sells information  she is terrific in a role that brought her another oscar nomination . its amazing that miss ritter was nominated six times for an academy award and she never won . this should have been the role that copped it for her   ,1
i wasn  t a fan of seeing this movie at all  but when my gf called me and said she had a free advanced screening pass i tagged along only for the sake of seeing eva longoria and laughing at jason biggs antics .  br    br   overall it was actually better then i expected but not by much . this was like a hybrid of how to lose a guy in   days and just like heaven . a typical romantic comedy with its moments i guess . the movie was quite short though  around   min .  but it was enough to tell the whole story  build some character development and have a decent happy ending . the whole idea of a ghost haunting its former husband was a interesting plot to follow . eva did a good job of keeping up the sarcasm and paul rudd and the rest of the supporting cast  especially jason biggs  kept the laughs coming at a smooth pace .  br    br   overall i liked the movie only because it had a good amount of laughs to keep me going otherwise i would have given this movie a lower rating . hey its a chick flick and i  m reviewing this movie from a guy  s persepctive alright  it would be more of a fair fight if females reviewied this movie and gave there thoughts about it .  ,1
i saw this film  it  s english title is  who  s singing over there    at the     montreal international film festival . it won raves then . . . and disappeared . a terrible shame . it is brilliant . sublime  ridiculous  sad  and extremely funny . the script is a work of art . it  s been   years and i  ve seen only a handful of comedies  or any other genre  for that matter  that can match its originality .  ,1
as you may or may not have heard  there is no actual fighting between vampires or zombies in this film . one may then ask why the title suggested such a thing  but really it  s kind of appropriate because nothing else about this film made any sense either . there was absolutely no story or plot  just things happening . the acting was incredibly bad  worse than safeauto commercials bad .  br    br   not only were there no fighting between vampires and zombies but i think there was only one scene with zombies even in it . their make up looked as if it were applied by an  year old girl . the scene was totally random and out of place and featured one of the characters fighting the zombies off with a hedge trimmer  i  m not kidding  but they used chainsaw sound effects .  br    br   this was undoubtedly the poorest movie i  ve ever seen in my life . the only circumstance that i wouldn  t totally ridicule every person responsible for production of this film is if i learned that it was produced entirely by   year old  s .  br    br   really though  even with all of the criticism i offer here  i  d suggest watching this movie solely based on the fact that it may very well be the worst movie ever  and because of this is quite comical . even just counting the flaws in it should keep you entertained .  ,0
collusion course is even worse than the typical  evil white male corporate capitalist  movie of the week . this movie is less pleasant than a toothache . jay leno can act . he  s good in his underrated debut movie  the silverbears  in which he gives a performance consist with the demands of his character . this movie is so bad leno  s character  a sanctimonious buffoon  is less annoying than morita  s character  a sanctimonious fool .  ,0
this film makes  american pie  a sophisticated movie  no further comment needed . humor is cheap  dialogues are stupid and the cast is awkward . every clich is used several times without any original twist . and far the worst  the movie turns out to be more catholic than the pope . it  s so sad .  ,0
this is a beautiful  rich  and very well  executed film with a rich and meaningful story . basically  it tells how an old master story teller needs to find a  male  heir to carry on his craft  but ends up not getting what he expected in his very male  dominated world . the characters must then deal with their situation and the old master must grapple with the conflict between his desire for a companion and heir and his and society  s traditional notions .  br    br   the story is fun  emotional  and complex . the exploration of the characters  their lives  and emotions  is rich and compelling the character development is strong while the characters are complex and not one dimensional at all . the film expertly conveys the old man  s emotions and his desire to find an heir  and compellingly shows how he and the kid handle the situation . there is also humour  sometimes quite subtle  at appropriate points . the film also examines the good and bad of traditional chinese culture  creating further interest and depth to the film .  br    br   the directing  acting  and scenery are all outstanding . added to the other strengths  this creates rich and convincing visual images and compelling  real characters . as a result  the film evokes strong empathy for  and feelings about  the characters .  br    br   some have claimed that the ending weakens the film  but i do not necessarily agree . perhaps it could have been stronger with a different ending  but any improvement in the overall film would have been rather small .  ,1
  my left foot  is a pretty impressive film that tells the story of christy brown  an artist who was crippled with cerebral palsy and learned to paint with his left foot  the only limb in his body he had control over . daniel day  lewis won his first oscar as best actor for this film  which i  m not absolutely certain was deserved  but is still noteworthy . day  lewis give brown a realistic and occasionally almost humorous touch . brenda fricker  as brown  s devoted mother  also won an oscar for a believable and touching role . my problem with this film is that it is a bit too real at times . when brown is in desperation and must help someone and do it all with his left foot  the film can be difficult to watch . this gives it an often depressing feel that may turn off some viewers for a time . however  if you look beyond that  you will see a sense of hope and inspiration for those who have handicaps and other difficulties to overcome . those of us who are not crippled and still consider ourselves to have problems are inspired by this film  because if somewhat with a much worse condition than us can overcome their difficulties  we can certainly do the same thing . well made  occasionally enjoyable  but difficult to watch . may not be for everyone  but not bad at all .  br    br    out of   ,1

we fans of ed wood tend to be an obsessive bunch in the first place  but this movie in particular has driven me to a level of fan  dom that i have never before approached  one of the most intense thrills of non  mainstream movie adulation  at least as far as i am concerned  is the pleasure of unearthing the obscure . i remember how  as a teenager  i longed to see eddie  s  revenge of the dead   a . k . a .  night of the ghouls    which at that time had been vaulted for a couple of decades . likewise such arcane masterpieces of low budget filmmaking as doris wishman  s  a night to dismember  or half the works of jesus franco  however  recent years have seen video and dvd rendering these once unfindable treasures almost too accessible  even for those of us on the  wrong     side of the atlantic . . . .  br    br   and then  behold  there was  i woke up early the day i died   a movie that should have been so  big   yet which disappeared into the ether even before fangoria printed the first fairly lengthy article on it that first whetted my appetite . the     s needed a hard  to  find movie though which would really be worth hunting out and this  to be sure is it . . . . i don  t especially wish to add too much of a commentary on all those marvellous aspects of the film  its classy  yet  kitsch cast  its haunting yet often hallucinogenic visuals  its wondrous moments of  pure cinema   in the sense of the     s french cineastes  and surrealism  or even its resoundingly memorable soundtrack  since this has all been described most eloquently by other users here .  br    br   what i do wish to mention  briefly  is the pleasure that i have received also from hunting down certain obscure artefacts relating to this almost  lost  to  us  but  thankfully  not  quite movie  i think the german video  which i picked up while in cologne on a cold crisp winter  s day  is fairly well  known to ed wood  s followers now . it is also quite common knowledge that a promotional poster for the film was released . however  there is thankfully more to be found    firstly  there are a number of reviews available from the film  s german theatrical release  i have used several of these in my translation classes in an attempt to  woodify  my students . . . . . some of these reviews are positive eulogies to the film  s artistry and entertainment value  and most interesting of all is that most critics placed it squarely within both the american trash and european arthouse traditions . secondly  there is the score by larry groupe   which can be acquired from the man himself  many of the tracks exert a truly emotional pull on the listener  particularly if you are contemplating the film  s currently  vaulted  status and growing a little melancholy at the same time . finally  for now  i wish to mention the promo soundtrack that cinequanon put out in extremely limited numbers . beg  borrow  steal  kill or do whatever it takes if you get the chance to acquire one of these       it features   tracks from the film  including eartha kitt  s ballad  the late darcy clay  s  jesus i was evil   two versions of which are also available on cd from new zealand  although that is another story again    the cool radio music to which christina ricci dances  and also those amazing techno drops by minty and zhv  the latter being billy z  s very own techno band  . . . . .  br    br   become obsessed  let ed wood rule your life .  ,1
the film looks super on paper . a romantic comedy in which a frantic lover gets dragged into a smuggling thriller should be generic cross  breeding gold  especially with this excellent romcomic cast .  br    br   i  m afraid lawrence kasdan simply gives his two stars too much rope though and they duly go and hang themselves . adam brooks  script may well be to blame but you  d expect better from the kevin kline of a fish called wanda . instead the two ping  pong off one another and the unlikely burgeoning romance is never reconciled satisfactorily with the reason either of them are in and dashing around france .  br    br   jean reno co  stars amiably as the cop  with  a  heart and i guess wishes he was a star  with  a  part . mind you he went on to do those pink panther remake  s   so perhaps he was ok with this . . .      ,0

this is one seriously disturbed movie . even though the boys deserved some of what they got . . . . . the sadistic gruesome executions were  slightly  over the top . the only character showing some conscience early in the hunt was killed off before he could offer some help to the sad plot .  br    br   at the beginning of the movie  there looked to be some promise of a mediocre affair  but this was just a ploy to lull the viewers into a false sense of security  before the joy of what was to come .  br    br   the only thing that could have saved the movie for me was if jack nicholson had jumped out of the bushes and yelled   and  where is the batman   . kim basinger could have screamed .  br    br   now that would have been cool   ,0
dumb is as dumb does  in this thoroughly uninteresting  supposed black comedy . essentially what starts out as chris klein trying to maintain a low profile  eventually morphs into an uninspired version of  the three amigos   only without any laughs . in order for black comedy to work  it must be outrageous  which  play dead  is not . in order for black comedy to work  it cannot be mean spirited  which  play dead  is . what  play dead  really is  is a town full of nut jobs . fred dunst does however do a pretty fair imitation of billy bob thornton  s character from  a simple plan   while jake busey does a pretty fair imitation of  well  jake busey .  merk  ,0

just saw this movie version of frank loesser  s guys and dolls for the third time with my mother who had never seen this before . she was pleasantly surprised by the singing voices of jean simmons and marlon brando . and she thought the havana sequences where simmons and brando dance up a storm were excellent . those were pretty impressive to me too and were usually the highlights of the film . directed by joseph l . mankiewicz  this movie which originated as a story by damon runyon takes a while with the slow pacing of the non  musical scenes at first but pulls you in after a while . the other story with frank sinatra and vivian blaine wasn  t as compelling to me but still had their charms especially during the  sue me  number . also loved stubby kaye  s  sit down  you  re rocking the boat  number and the performances of sheldon leonard and b . s . pully . with a theatrical look throughout  guys and dolls isn  t a great film musical but certainly a very good one .  ,1
wow probable the worst movie i have ever seen   this person should never make another movie   i cant believe anyone would have produce this in good conscience . you have have wasted every cent . no concept of real life . i have wasted  hours of my life i will never get back . ever    everyone who worked on this show should be embarrassed       i  m embarrassed for them  all of you should be ashamed . if i was gay i would want to tell the director that they have personally set back gay rights progress by  years . please never watch this movie . i have never written a blogg about a film before but the distaste for this film has compelled me to do so .  ,0
this has to be the worst film i have ever seen . i bought the dvd and it didn  t work  well the dvd worked fine  its just the film didn  t  in fact its so bad that i think non of the actors have worked since  or before judging from the acting  . there is no real plot to speak of and no real horror . the production values are rubbish even for a low budget film with some outside scenes being hard to hear due to wind on the microphone .  br    br   all in all it was so bad a film that a viewer could think it was going to turn into a porno if they didn  t know any better  which have been an improvement  . there are only two lines in the film that are funny  both of which revolve around the transvestite prostitute .  although they hardly merit watching all   minutes for   br    br   as for the marketing of the dvd i feel thoroughly cheated . i mean reading the back i expected it to be bad  br    br   he chose his weapons . he selected his victims . he picked his nose . he turned into a girl   br    br   but i thought it might be funny . also the case claims it is digitally re mastered  i would love to have seen it beforehand  the print is so grainy you could use it as sand paper . the case also says it is an absolute disgusting movie  in what way   disgusting production  acting .  br    br   this film out stays it welcome in the first five minutes   if you are considering buying this i would say buy bad taste  instead it is a much better film and is funny  also it has peter jackson the director of the lotr in it .   br    br   incidentally if anyone knows anything about any of the actors  or director patrick j mathews  and what they have done since  please post here as i would love to know  purely to find out if there is a worse movie out there  or if anyone in this film ever bothered to learn to act  ,0
 . . . and i do mean it . if not literally  after all  i have not seen every movie ever created    at least  obviously  among the ones  the many i know .  br    br    .     the rule of thumb with imdb is this sometimes movies rated very highly  for example  the piece of kannes  kompetition  krowned  korean  kraap called  oldboy   can be truly bad . but rarely a movie worth watching is actually rated under  . this movie  very much worth watching  is . a disgrace .  br    br   true  i give it a   in protest . the movie is not perfect . its true rating should be an  or a  . it has some acting flaws  belafonte especially   the script wanders around  sometimes . however  what we have here is one of the greatest directors of all times  the czech jan kadar  directing two of the greatest actors of all time  the beloved  larger  than  life zero mostel and the sublime ida kaminska in an acting  poetic  moral tour de force . a pair made in heaven  it  s true that this movie  little flaws apart  does not pander to the average audiences  but those interested in watching an excellent  while  again  not beyond criticism  movie of the incomparable director who gave us  the shop on the main street   the best movie ever about holocaust  should not miss this just because some silly imdb rating system decides that  american beauty  is better than  the angel levine  .  br    br   it isn  t .  ,1
personally  i think that the film was done very professionally  i loved the choreography and the acting . the plot is also gripping and mysterious . the film itself is very emotional  and what i liked about it most is that it makes you think afterwards . antonio gades has absolutely lived his role to the end  and i must say that it  s one of my favourite pictures and saura is a wonderful director .  ,1
having heard so many people raving about this film i thought i  d give it a go . apart from being incredibly slow  which i don  t mind as long as the wait is worth it  but it just isn  t . as many others have said there are so many inconsistencies and so much of this film just doesn  t ring true . the reaction of the  men switches from shock  horror on finding the body to complete indifference whilst they fish . surely if they were the type of men that would go on happily fishing  then they would have just reported the body and said they had only discovered it after their fishing trip . . . . why on earth tie the body to a tree  go fishing and then tell everyone you found the body  days previously  its so hard to watch a film knowing that the behaviour of the main characters is so inconsistent . as for the rest of the townsfolk  well you  d think at least one of them might show some curiosity about who actually killed the woman  the body itself  naked except for the knickers . . . . what scenario leads to that  if she was raped then why still the knickers  if she was raped with the clothes on  then why remove them afterwards bar the knickers  if she wasn  t raped  then why take all her clothes off bar the knickers . . . . leaving yourself with evidence to dispose of  i truly cant think of any realistic scenario that would lead to that other than killing someone to steal their clothes so you can fill up your jumble sale stall  oh well its watchable but only just and only because  despite the poor script  the acting is strong .  ,0
while not quite as monstrously preposterous as later works  this slow  moving  repetitive giallo offers some nice touches in the first half  but grows more and more lethargic and silly as it stumbles to its lame denouement .  br    br   to be sure  the actors are above average  considering this is an argento movie  and some moments show the director  s visual skills  but whole sequences should  ve been cut and  basically  it  s just the same exploitative trash as ever  wallowing in fake science and abnormal sexual depravity .  br    br    out of   genetic disorders  ,0
this movie has been poorly received and badly reviewed . the book by rebecca west was written in      soon after wwi  when shell shock and trauma  induced amnesia were not clichs  as the reviewers call it many books and movies later . it is difficult to go back in time and live  as the characters lived  the realities of the time the war and the horror of the experience of the first war to use lethal gas  the british class system the wife thought all  important  the hopeless spinster  and the lover from the past still seen with the eyes of love being as young and as beautiful as she was   years ago .  br    br   alan bates as the amnesiac soldier who  will die  if he isn  t allowed to see margaret  the girl of his youthful dreams  builds on the devotion his character showed in  far from the madding crowd  . having seen that performance  it is possible to sense his strong romantic attachment to the girl who didn  t live up to the family  s and society  s expectations . margaret says   we quarreled  and as you rowed away  you turned your face away from me .  so we know that the breakup was something that he instigated  that it brought him shame  but that he forgot the shame in his memory of his time with margaret . i haven  t seen all his films  but in the ones i  ve seen  he imparts a strong masculinity  which shines through even in this role as the disabled soldier .  br    br   i didn  t even recognize ann  margaret at first and feel that her performance has been underrated . not having read the book  i wondered whether the child who died was the result of acting on a borderline incestuous feeling between jenny and chris  though jenny does state that she  is a cousin  . the way kitty keeps jenny in the nursery in the hair  drying scene  the fact that kitty says she always dries her hair in that room seems more a way for kitty to keep the coals of anger hot than the orientation of the room to the sun  or sentiment about a lost child  and the statement she made that she wished chris hadn  t felt it necessary to preserve the room exactly as it was when the child was alive made her seem uncaring toward the memory of the child . also  jenny is shown as living in the house in a subservient role  as high society would have done to a fallen member at the time .  br    br   having recently been the recipient of the intense fantasy of a lover  non  sexualin keeping with the mores of the time  from   years ago  i couldrelate to margaret  s and her husband  s dilemma . i  too  was cast aside because i wasn  t good enough for his family  and upon his rediscovery of me via the internet  i was burdened with helping him deal with his still very horrifying vietnam experiences and a marriage to a woman above his class whom he didn  t believe he loved . my husband  like margaret  s was very understanding  but the strain was very real . the lover was finally able to reconcile his real  life situation with his fantasy of loving only me .  br    br   i thought that it was a good decision to show very little of the reliving of the war experience that was happening in chris  s mind . i thought of  mrs . dalloway  with the wwi soldier who acts out very violent memories and commits suicide versus chris  s joy in his fantasy of margaret . in contrast  the actiona of the soldier in  mrs . dalloway  seems overwrought .  br    br   showing that the psychiatrist understood very little of what was happening to chris underlines what a major problem the whole group faced . everyone seems to get their life back  but was it the right choice   ,1
there are no words to explain how bad nightmare weekend is . it simply defies description . something about a computer that can change personal objects into silver balls that enter the victims  mouth  which kills them or turns them into zombies . the whole thing is so wonky that it  s stunning . there  s also a girl with personal computer in her room and the computer talks via a hand puppet         i  m not making this stuff up . the computer also controls things like cars  even though there  s nothing linking the computer with the vehicle .  br    br   the  film  is total trash . surreal bad trash . spectacularly  one  of  a  kind bad trash . there  s a lot of sex scenes thrown here and there  which aren  t very hot or erotic . there  s even one scene where a woman seemingly makes love or wants to french kiss a tarantula  which had me rolling on the floor .  br    br   definitely one of the worst movies ever made . up there with the equally wretched direct  to  home video boardinghouse  or boogeyman ii  both nightmare weekend and boogeyman ii have scenes with a killer toothbrush   . at least it  s fun to watch it and try to make sense of whatever is going on .  ,0
too bad a couple of comments before me don  t know the facts of this case . it is based on actual events  a highly publicized disappearance and murder case taking place in the wilmington  de  philadelphia pa region from    through     . i have to admit i was highly skeptical of how hollywood would dramatize the actual history and events and was actually quite impressed on how close they stayed to what was constantly reported on local newscasts and philadelphia inquirer news stories throughout the time period . of course i immediately pointed out that the actress  who i really like in cold case  who played fahey looked nothing like her  anne marie was actually prettier  . i have to admit though that mark harmon really nailed the type of personality that was revealed as capano  s and the behavior that capano exhibited throughout this period . details of the case were right on . . . no deviations of dramatic effect . . . even down to the carpet  gun  furniture  and cooler . in conclusion  i also wanted to add that i have met tom carper many times at various functions  a good man  despite being a politician  and i am so glad that he pulled the strings in the federal realm necessary to solve this heinous crime . guys like capano are real and it was great to see him finally put behind bars .  ,1
ok  so it borrows a little from  it  s a wonderful life   but that was   years prior to this film  so why not a new attempt . belushi is having a rotten   th birthday . he didn  t get his wheaties  his coffee  and has lost his job . the capper is when his self described  big blue piece of sh  car breaks down at the end of the day . he heads into an empty bar to call for a tow . while waiting  he  s recognized by the bartender  caine  as the kid who lost the town  s championship baseball game   years earlier . this gets him to thinking how life would  ve been if he had won the game . he finds out when  unbeknownst to him  caine serves up a motion potion in a glass that gives him a mansion  the prom queen  russo  as his wife  and makes him president of the sporting goods company he  s been canned from . caine later reveals himself as the one who  s responsible for this change  but belushi is not entirely on board . he never fully adjusts  and in a plot development that doesn  t kill the movie but is still odd  he tries to court his wife  hamilton  from his real life  who is now married to someone else . the good move is that they don  t spend too much time on it  as basically they rip of  ghost   with belushi constantly telling hamilton things only she could know . it also brings in a hokey dramatic element  as two of his lovers kevetch in the shadows  new wife russo  and his unbalanced lover cox . but the keys to the film are the somewhat lengthy beginning  and cheery end . also good work from the big and recognizable cast  as belushi is very likable  very attractive ladies chosen  and caine is perfectly easy going as the title guy . strange that this was belushi  s second film of     dealing with him getting an alternative lifestyle of riches  which was found in  taking care of business  . though similar  both films are on the same level of laughs provided . so check this out for a fun exploration of  what if    ,1

in the areas where they overlap this fine movie is light years ahead of     s innocence  which gave the impression of a rheumy eye and heavy breathing ogling young girls . here the effect is much more realistic and really gets inside the heads of the three protagonists as they fumble their way through an adolescence riddled with pitfalls . the three principals  all unknown to me give very sure  footed performances  the kind  in fact  that may be so natural that it will be difficult for them to replicate this quality of acting in other films so i wouldn  t be too surprised if they are not heard from again . it would be nice if this could get away from the art houses and into the multiplexes where there  s just an outside chance it might  speak  to the bubblegum crowd it isn  t aimed at .  ,1
this is a really interesting movie . it is an action movie with comedy mixed in . foxx teams up with comedian epps in this movie to give it a comedic spin . it will keep you wondering whats going to happen to foxx next . it was a well shot movie  the director used the right colors in this movie  dark blue colors  to give it the right kind of feel . kimberly elise also starred in this movie and it is always a pleasure to see her on the big screen . she plays her role well . even jamie kennedy is in this movie . it  s worth seeing it you haven  t seen it . it  s definitely worth having if you are a jamie foxx fan . it deserves more credit than it is actually given .  ,1
let  s hope this is the final nightmare . this is the epitome of a good thing gone bad . okay  there is still some enjoyment to be had  but only in the most mundane sense . rachel talalay had been there for the duration of this franchise  had been on the production staff and produced even . i don  t know what she was thinking  but this debacle comes complete with the human video game boy and a guest appearance by  br    br   tom and roseanne arnold  i wish i had a clue what she was thinking when she wrote  directed this disappointing piece of garbage . she even tried to distract her audience from the fact that this movie was nothing more than an over  glorified popcorn movie instead of bearing any resemblance to horror  with the contrived use of a  d ending . aren  t those glasses nifty  and you get to keep them  it  s the equivalent of  you just spent   .   making me rich . here  s   cents . now  don  t you feel special   sorry  but for me  it just did not make me feel special .  br    br   and freddy  s had yet another face  lift . this one was for the worst  i think . all the beautiful artistry that went into his  look  in the earlier films has been replaced by an obviously cheaper  less detailed set of prosthetics . he looks . . . less like the burn victim he is supposed to be  and more like he has a skin disorder . changing the lead  s makeup like that so far into a series is about on the same level as changing the lead actor . but wait  they  ve done that  and done that . so i guess it doesn  t matter . but it mattered to me . freddy is no longer scary . he  s just . . . another low  rent monster like the leprechaun .  br    br   it  s more . . . a dark comedy than the horror classic this series promises riddled with what you can only hope the writers thought were witty one  liners and clever repartee  sadly  it fell short on both accounts  .  br    br   so there  s nothing more to say than grab the popcorn and get ready to laugh  because there was not one scary or suspenseful moment in this entire film .  br    br   it rates a  .     from . . .  br    br   the fiend  .  ,0

rosie wasted a lot of tv time talking about the tainos as if they were super influential in the dynamics of the modern day puerto rican . they were not . the truth is that the africans and the spanish were and she knows it . what kills me is that she is standing on the screen looking like some average light skin black chick  with an obvious black daddy  cousins and auntie  pretending to truly acknowledge the real essence of what makes them the modern day puerto ricans  but barely mentioned how africans influenced the way their spanish is spoken  the food and music . she is so typical and i lost a lot of respect for her and will not support anything else she does . also  since she wants to dance around her african  ness then she need not take more roles associated with blackness  i . e . lackawanna blues  . we can find a prideful black latina next time  thank you zoe saldana  gina torres  gina ravera and melissa desousa  .  br    br   to the puerto rican on here that said they are african and not  black  . . . . thank you . we  blacks  certainly do not have anything in common with  you  so there is no love lost . but  since you are probably in the states and have benefited from the civil rights movement we would like for you refuse any decent human treatment you received courtesy of the blood  sweat and tears from the backs of the  blacks  you share nothing with .  br    br   if i am correct puerto ricans have a terrible image in the media  but we blacks do not spend our time trying to disrespect you because we know that the media loves to exploits the low points and behaviors of all minorities to maintain mindless generalizations . however  you evidently have fed into the hype that one you are somehow white or superior . . . you are not . also  you somehow feel compelled to believe that black culture is bet . . . again you are incorrect and need to take a vacation out of the hood . try visiting atlanta  ga .  houston  texas  charlotte  n . c . trust me none of those blacks want to claim your  culture  either .  ,0
the music and laurence olivier  s sombre delivery set the tone perfectly for this outstanding documentary . this is still a must see for ww ii buffs  descendants of the participants of that conflict  politicians who think things always go their way when they extend their foreign policy via the deck of an aircraft carrier  did you hear that george bush   and anyone else curious or needing to know the whys whos and hows of some aspect of that conflict . the   episodes are roughly in chronological order but can be seen out of sequence since they are more or less self contained . there is bound to be new insight for the new viewer because of the sheer volume presented . actual footage of the battles is interspersed with interviews of those involved in the stories . many of the interviews are with second line authorities  that is  support personnel to the main characters  privates  captains  secretaries  eyewitnesses and the like . you get a real upfront taste of what war is all about .  br    br   i am presently watching the dvd version of the original television documentary . i strongly recommend this over the worn out  gaptoothed  overpriced vhs offerings available on ebay . i paid     cdn for five   sided dvd discs . this new release includes bonus material and is in full screen mode . the menus are easy to follow  there is first a choice of which episode you want to view and then after selecting that you are given the option of various chapters in the episode or to play the whole episode . it is understandable with such a comprehensive presentation there is a tiny amount more of navigation in the menu but the impact of what you will see is not diminished after   years  nay  after   years since the war finished .  br    br   i remember watching the first broadcast on the buffalo pbs station just before moving from london in     and wishing right from that time that i could have a copy . now my wish has finally come true .  br    br   see this documentary . tell your friends . buy a copy for your library . remember and honour the sacrifices and challenges overcome by those from america  russia  britain  canada and all the other nations and peoples involved in the final victory . what an eye opener .  ,1

the christmas secret was touted as a wonderful film  but i was truly disappointed . they even sold vhs and dvd copies of the film when it was over  which leads me to think the producers were really proud of this project . as a screen actor myself i felt most of the performances were phoned in  although beau bridges  as nick  did have a moment or two . if i were richard thomas i would not put this film on my otherwise fine resume . it was an embarrassment . i had been a fan since his waltons days  but have found myself untempted to watch any of his subsequent work  so poor was this offering .  br    br   in defence of the actors  the directing was stilted  mechanical  and thoroughly amateurish .  br    br   i hope this is not considered a spiteful review and negative assumptions made about my qualifications as a critic . i turned the movie on because it had a good cast and i was prepared to enjoy the film . however i would challenge any one out there to watch this film and not wish for their money back  even though it was on t . v .  ,0
not only was the plot of this film contrived with the ease in which the two psychos are able to kidnap a pregnant woman without breaking a sweat but it was a terrible rip  off of  misery  . however  the main reason i gave this film such a low rating was because it absolutely disgusted me .  br    br   i  m not someone easily shocked by what film  makers dish out and have always had a love for horror flicks but this film went too far purely in terms of violence and torture just for the sake of getting points in the shock factor .  br    br   i think most people  when watching just the first ten minutes of  hide and seek   will find themselves reaching for the remote .  ,0
spoilers                                  br    br   i watched half of this movie and i didn  t like it .  br    br   first reason boring . barely anything happens  the women sit around and discuss how terrible their lives are and how they have no hope  they smoke weed  read magazines  care for their sick friend  and cut up the occasional dead body . boring      br    br   second reason there are too many things left unexplained . many scenes are dedicated to a zombie hunter who kidnaps random men  restrains them in a chair and interrogates them . who are these men  how do they know anything about illegal activity concerning the diseased flesh eaters  why does he kill one and let another one go   br    br   also there is this dude who at first i thought also had the flesh eating disease but he puts his fist through a wall with superhuman strength suggesting he  s not quite what we originally thought  never explained  how frustrating is that   br    br   conclusion i found the women annoying  the story uninteresting  the duologue tedious  and the action non  existent . also the cover art is misleading since it makes you believe this movie is going to be cool when it clearly isn  t . i rented this movie based on some of the reviews made by other people on this website  and although i respect the fact that some people might have enjoyed this flick  i will from now on make sure i read more than two reviews deep into a movie so as to avoid renting another movie i regret seeing .  ,0
hey guys i  m actually in this movie  i didn  t even know it was on this site until i looked a few years ago and i was so surprised  i played pete  the main characters son . it was a great experience and i loved every minute of it . while filming they needed me to be in two places at once  so they used my twin sister as a body double  the finger that pushes the radio button in the car is hers not mine . i still act and do some tv  but not as much . oh and if you want proof my name is the first one at the top of the scroll .  br    br   review i thought the movie was okay but if i wasn  t in it  it wouldn  t be one of my favorites . i thought the acting was really good  but the story line was only so  so .  ,1
might contain possible spoilers  not that anything in this film is new or will even mildly surprise you for that matter   br    br   why does disney feel the need to recycle everything they ever made into oblivion  sure it  s cheaper for them  but after a while  wouldn  t you think there overall quality and the way people think of them would drop off . house of villains is a despicable display of cartoon crossovers that make absolutely no sense at all . some signs of the total disregard for previous films in this are the voices don  t even remotely match up and iago is evil again  since when    i know that these films are directly towards children but there was a time when all could enjoy disney films . even the movie  s musical number  which had been disney  s specialty for years  stunk . i wouldn  t recommend this film to anyone even the very young . all i can is that if more of these movies of the same caliber are released  it  s only a matter of time before some small animation studio surpasses disney in overall quality .  ,0
ben  arthur could have been a   . sam mraovich wrote  directed  stared  and produced this movie . sam should have given his idea to a good writer  director  and left the acting to somebody who could act . this is a good example of one person controlling the whole production . there was nobody to tell him   sam this is bad  really bad  .  br    br   jamie brett gabel  s acting was the only good point  but he could have been so much better with a good director  and better actors to work with .  br    br   this movie is so bad i think sam mraovich should be tied to a chair and made to watch this movie  twice  . the acting and direction was so bad  this movie was turned into a comedy . you just had to laugh  and in the wrong places .  br    br   a second good point . . . . this would make a great date movie . after the first two minutes you would quit watching the movie and pay more attention to your date   ,0
i never expect a film adaptation to follow too closely to the novel  especially a beloved one  like evening  but when i saw that the book  s author  susan minot  was a screenplay writer and executive producer on the film  i thought that evening would be a good adaptation .  br    br   if you enjoyed the book  don  t bother with this movie . it is so far afield of the book that the two hardly bear any resemblance to one another .  br    br   here  our characters are completely different the bride is in love with harris . harris is the son of the housekeeper . buddy is a drunk  in love with ann and  or harris . i don  t think a single character made it from the book to the screen oh it just gets worst with every passing moment .  br    br   and  really  didn  t we learn from bridges of madison county that cutting from the story we are meant to be enthralled in  to scenes of our heroes  grown children having obnoxious and juvenile fights  simply does not work on film  this film is a disaster . skip it .  ,0
before there was crash  there was this interesting film called grand canyon . released about   years sooner than the former film  grand canyon was a movie about two people from different backgrounds who come together as friends over a lifetime . to me crash was still a slightly better film  but grand canyon was no slouch either .  br    br   taking place in los angeles  an upper  class lawyer named mack  kevin kline  takes a shortcut through the seedier side of town only to have his car break down at the worst time . he calls for a tow truck  and has to wait for awhile  only to soon be threatened by a group of dangerous people who want his car . soon the tow truck driver arrives at the perfect moment  and out steps simon  danny glover  to take the truck away . both men are threatened  but simon manages to get himself  mack  and the car out of dire straits . it is from here on out that a friendship develops between the two men over a lifetime with mack helping out simon just as simon had helped him out of a dangerous situation earlier . you see simon  s sister deborah  tina lifford  is living in a dangerous neighborhood with her two children  and fears for her oldest son who seems to be roaming the streets at night with some bad people . mack offers them a better place to live as well as hooking simon up with his secretary  s friend jane  alfre woodard  .  br    br   this is the main plot of the film  but there are other smaller plots involving the same secretary mentioned above  mary louise parker  as well as mack  s wife   mary mcdonnel  who discovers an abandoned baby not long after their son roberto  jeremy sisto in his first movie role  has gone to camp for the summer  and will likely be moving on with his own life soon . the details of all these plots are brought together into one complex movie which uses a police helicopter as a metaphor for life and as a bridge to entwine all the different scenes . this simple plot device works very well and helps greatly with the flow of the story .  br    br   the director lawrence kasdan  whose biggest movie to this date was the big chill  has created a splendid movie here . the cast is excellent  and most of the ideas are well thought out  but alas it falls short of greatness because some points  that would  ve made the film even stronger  are glossed over . the story involving the secretary is one  and the second involving simon  s nephew is the other . these scenes should  ve been more apart of the entire story  and then maybe lawrence kasdan  s views of life between the upper and lower classes would  ve been more on a superior level instead of just very good . still grand canyon exceeded expectations  and yes you will get to see a view of the canyon that this movie was named after . there is also a small role for steve martin as davis  a producer of violent films  who offers his own views on life  and has a small part to play in this movie  s ideas .  ,1
after fatih akins first work  im juli   which was fairly good  he created a really gorgeous italian family epic . its a german movie  which is unfortunately a bad precondition  cause we rareley produce more than moderate movies   . but this movie makes some very good snapshots of the time then .  solino  is about a italian immigrant who arrives in the  ruhr  region of germany during the   s . the immigrant and his family then start the first pizza restaurant in the region . the characters are excellent drawn . especially gigi  the main actor . you live every second  every feeling he does . his brother  played by moritz bleibtreu  isnt that good . well  you just dont believe him the role . but the character is wellbalanced and fits perfectly into this script . i feel an urgent need to compare the style of this movie with the style of  the godfather  . many people will probably hate this movie  say its boring . not much tension   yes  but an outrageous movie .  out of   .  ,1
for those who commented on the patriot as being accurate   which basically satanised the english   it was interesting to see this film . by all accounts this was the bloodiest war that americans have ever been involved in  and they were the only nationality present . it was therefore very refreshing to see something resembling historical accuracy coming from that side of the atlantic that did not paint america as either martyrs or saviours . all in all though what this film did bring home was the true horrors of any conflict  and how how whatever acts are committed in war only breed worse acts  often culminating in the suffering of the innocent . this was not a film where you cheered anybody on but both pitied and loathed all .  ,1
i  m a christian . i have always been skeptical about movies made by christians  however . as a rule  they are  know  nothings  when it comes to movie production . i admire tbn for trying to present god and jesus in a positive and honest way on the screen . however  they did a hideous job of it . the acting was horrible  and unless one is familiar with the bible in some fashion  one could not have understood what the movie was trying to get across . not only was the movie terribly made  but the people who made it even had some facts wrong . however  in this  critique   those facts are irrelevent and too deep to delve into . in short  the omega code is the absolute worst movie i have ever seen  and i would not recommend it to anyone  except for comic relief from the every day grind .  ,0
the movie is pretty funny and involving for about four dates  then it becomes a blatant commercial for some guy you  and even his  friends   really can  t stand . it is a pretty interesting concept film dates on a quest to find true love in modern la . the problem is that it feels incredibly  and badly  scripted at times and blatantly self  promoting . it is difficult to care about and be drawn into any of the characters because the writer  actor is so egotistical  uncool  untrue  and simply unlikeable . you end up feeling sorry for his dates .  ,0

i was expecting a movie similar to deuce bigalow  which i enjoyed . however  this dud seemed to last forever . it  s one of those flicks which enjoys the sad placement of pg    while not being kid appropriate . the jokes aren  t just low  brow or ft jokes  they  re crude  lewd  and many acts cross the boundaries to not only bad taste but beyond legal and moral decency . many scenes appear to have been chopped to get the pg    rating . . . too bad . . . it might have made a bigger splash as an r  rated film if the funny was left in .  overstatement  probably .  i do not recommend this movie . it is a full  on waste of time . . . and i  m a movie lover and ready to give just about anything a shot . at   minutes in  the movie felt like it should be winding down . . . and boy were we ready for it to . the ending is quaint but doesn  t salvage the rest of this quagmire  tourist trap of a rental .    star  glad i saw it as a freebie . . . would have been sickened to pay hard  earned greenbacks for this tripe   ,0
this movie is a true reflection of the australian resourcefulness that has been required to make this country what it is over the last    years . not pompous like the british  not gung  ho like the americans . if either of those countries had attempted what this crew did  it would have failed dismally . either due to ignorance on the british part  or too much faith in superior firepower on the american side .  true  australians  i . e . non  imports  are the only ones who can excel in modern military conflicts because they have had to improvise most of their adult lives . just look at examples like gallipoli paschendale tobruk new guinea and vietnam .  ,1

the bill was essentially a cultural fountain from which a beautiful rainbow  haze of socio  introspection emerged  inspiring such famed derivatives as cop land  the departed  the godfather   and most recently of course  the wire .  br    br   with multi  faceted characters and story lines that have been described as    dimensional shakespeare   the bill grabbed you by the collars from episode one and just would not let you go .  br    br   the show covered  anticipated  and even occasionally caused all the major global events between     and     . the most famously prescient moment being episode   of series   which aired on the eve of the second gulf war . detective jim carver  s misguided  and ultimately career ending  drugs raid on craig  fun boy  richardson  s flat in the jasmine allen estate in early      was widely viewed as a predictive allegory for the coalition  s failure to find weapons of mass destruction following the invasion of iraq several months later .  br    br   however  it was the work the bill did to try and highlight some of the lesser  known problems experienced by police officers that won it the most praise . this was sympathetic drama covering such sensitive areas as helmet  phobia  under  uniform cross  dressing  in  van homosexuality  lost truncheons  casual drunken bestiality  regretted   siren aversion syndrome  sas   groin chaffing caused by chasing suspects while wearing an overly starched uniform and many  many more issues that still trouble  disturb  haunt and excite officers to this day .  br    br   the last word should go to one of the bill  s most famous fans  nelson mandela  it is no exaggeration to say that i would not have made it through the dark void of loneliness that summed up my last years of incarceration on robben island if it wasn  t for the heart  warming  casual buffoonery of reg hollis .   ,1
master director ching siu tung  s perhaps most popular achievement is this series  a chinese ghost story    . chinese ghost story stars leslie cheung in some distant past in china as a tax collector who is forced to spend a night during his  collecting trip  in a mysterious castle in which some strange old warriors fight and meet him . beautiful actress joey wang  wong is the ghost who lives in that castle and is under a domination of one powerful demon  a wood devil who collects human souls for herself  itself with the help of her beautiful ghosts . leslie and joey fall in love  and even though ghosts are not allowed to live with humans  they decide to break that rule and live happily together for the rest of their lives . this is not what the wood devil thinks and our protagonists have to fight for their lives and their happiness .  br    br   this film is no less full of magic than other films by ching siu tung . his masterpieces include duel to the death       and the swordsman series  which all have incredible visuals and kinetic power in their action scenes . ghost story is full of brilliant lightning and dark atmosphere  which is lightened by the strong presence of the beautiful and good willing ghost . the effects are simply breath taking and would work at their greatest power in the big screen . the camera is moving and twisted all the time and it adds to the fairy tale atmosphere this film has . there  s plenty of wire  fu stunts  too  and even though some think they are and look gratuitous or stupid when used in films  i cannot agree and think they give motion pictures the kind of magic  freedom and creativeness any other tool could not give . when people fly in these films  it means the films are not just about our world  and they usually depict things larger than life with the power of this larger than life art form .  br    br   the story about the power of love is pretty touching and warm  but the problem is  again  that the characters are little too shallow and act unexplainably occasionally . leslie and joey should have been written with greater care and their characters should be even more warm  deep and genuine in order to give the story a greater power and thus make the film even more noteworthy and important achievement . also  the message about love and power of it is underlined little too much at one point and it should have been left just to the viewer  s mind to be interpreted and found . another negative point about the dialogue is that it  s too plenty and people talk in this film without a reason . that is very irritating and sadly shows the flaws many scriptwriters tend to do when they write their movies . people just talk and talk and it  s all there just to make everything as easy to understand as possible and so the film is not too challenging or believable as it has this gratuitous element . just think about the films of the japanese film maker takeshi kitano his films have very little dialogue and all there is is all the necessary as he tells his things by other tools of cinema and never talks  or makes other characters talk too much in his movies . this is just the talent the writers should have in order to write greater scripts .  br    br   otherwise  chinese ghost story is very beautiful and visually breath taking piece of eastern cinema  and also the song that is played in the film is very beautiful and hopefully earned some award in the hong kong film awards back then . i give chinese ghost story     and without the flaws mentioned above  this would without a doubt be almost perfect masterpiece of the fantasy genre .  ,1
i have heard a lot about this film  with people writing me telling me i should see it  as i am a fan of extremely bloody  gory movies . i got my hands on it almost right away  but one thing or another always kept me from watching it  until now . i would have been better off not remembering i even had it .  br    br   this movie was atrocious . the worst thing though is that it could have been so much better than it actually was . i know it was a story by clive barker and all  and no i have not read that story  but it appears to me that if you haven  t then you will be  as i was  completely clueless and utterly disappointed .  br    br   the film begins good enough  the actors are convincing  the story interesting . the first scene is bloody  a great way to catch your attention . i thought the blood looked a bit bad  but seeing as it was the very first scene i did hope for improvement later on . i was wrong .  br    br   the blood and effects are so horrible  it was almost an insult to my intelligence to be expected to believe that  for instance  someone could knock a person  s head right off their shoulders using only a meat hammer . wtf  cgi blood  did they even use any  real  blood at all  my home made stuff looks better than any used in this film    unbelievable acts of dismemberment  eyeballs popping out just from getting hit in the back of the head arms cut neatly off  does no one remember there are bones all throughout our bodies     too  dark scenes  every scene is either an odd yellow color  or in hidden in shadows  . . . it just gets worse and worse . i found myself pointing out mistake after mistake . there  s just too much . add that to the fact that what could have and should have been a great serial  killer movie turns into some demonic  supernatural  monster movie at the end . . . no thank you  it should have been kept as a creepy guy butchering people in the subway  ok  with a conspiracy theory thrown in  and an overzealous photographer . maybe they murder people and sell the meat via the meat plant  plausible  doable . . . and a lot better i think than the  real  story . that could have and should have worked . instead it became a  creatures living at the end of the old tunnel and everyone knows about it but you  and unless you read the book  well . . . you just won  t ever understand it  fiasco . tragic  what an awful thing to do to a movie with such potential . if you like mindless fake blood and gore  you  ll love this . but if you have half a brain in your head then you will completely hate it . stay away  far  far away .  ,0
such a long awaited movie . . but it has disappointed me and my friends who had gone to see the movie on the first day . . from the trailers it looked like a action movie  but it turned out to be a out  out comedy  a bad comedy  . but one thing that deserves appreciation is the acting by these professional actors  they  ve done their part of the movie very well . good acting  but i don  t think that can save the movie . . india has been shot beautifully . kerala  rajasthan   ladakh   were all saturated with color  alright . nevertheless the way the intrinsic beauty of these places was shot made me want to find out exactly where those places were and when i could go there     br    br   action sequences were shot very shabbily  no one could make out head  tail of the stunts  they  ve used akki  akshay kumar  very well but could  ve been done much much better . .  br    br   animation is the worst i  ve seen in recent movies     s movies had better animation scenes i guess  initial scene where the car is falling off  flying should be better word  the road into lake  .  br    br   and the movies name has been mentioned nearly every   to   mins  just to make sure audiences don  t forget the movie name i guess . .  ,0
spider  man is in my opinion the best superhero ever  and this game is the best superhero game ever . while it may be somewhat easy  you have to play it several times to get all the costumes and comic book covers  which makes up for how easy it is to get through the game . it may seem hard to control at first  but once you get the hang of it  you will be web  slinging like spider  man himself .  br    br   the bosses  while like the levels are somewhat easy  are fun . the first boss  scorpion  is incredibly easy to beat  which shouldn  t be so because as fans of the comic books know  scorpion is one of spider  man  s most deadly villains . the second boss  rhino  is also very easy . the  rd boss is venom  who is in my opinion the easiest boss in the game  which definately shouldn  t be . the  th boss is venom again . this time  he is a little bit more difficult to beat but still easy . the  th boss is mysterio  who i think is the funnest boss to battle in the game . he is also one of the harder bosses  but once again  still fairly easy . next boss is carnage  who is  you guessed it  easy to beat . but carnage is actually kind of fun to fight .  th boss is doctor octopus  who is like all the other bosses easy  but not as easy as the other ones because he has a shield . the  th and final boss is exclusive to the game  never in a comic book or cartoon . i won  t spoil it for you for those of you who haven  t played the game  but the boss is the only boss in the game that isn  t too easy . took me  or  tries to beat while the others i beat on the first or second tries .  br    br   all in all  a very good game . i gave it an  out of   . the reasons why i didn  t give it a  or   are that once you get all the costumes and comic book covers it gets kind of boring  getting all that stuff will take a while though   it is not very accurate according to the comic books or cartoon show  the bosses are too easy  and they should have used hobgoblin and  or green goblin as a boss  i think it would be fun to battle someone flying around in the air  they didn  t use them in the sequel to this game either  well the green goblin is the villain in the upcoming spider  man movie  so hopefully they will make a video game based on the movie .  ,1
this is not my favorite wip   women in prison    but it is one of the most famous films in the sub  genre . it is was produced by roger corman  who at this point had already produced a few wips . it is obvious that the film tries to play with the established formula . the movie takes place in an usa prison  not in a  banana republic  like most wip films . i  m not sure if that was a wise move  but it is an acceptable change of pace . writer  director demme really gets into his job  always digging for new ways to present a familiar scenario . in fact  he is a little too ambitious for his own good . the filmmaker creates a few surreal dream sequences that are borderline pretentious but it is fun to see how hard he tries to put this film above your average chicks  in  chains flick . but do not worry  demme still operates within the parameters of the sub  genre . there is plenty of nudity and violence  something that will satisfy hardcore fans . the film is a little slow  but it is very entertaining . the cast is good . roberta collins is a wip veteran  so she does not need an introduction  and barbara steel is a hoot as the wheelchair  bound crazy warden . pam grier is sorely missed  though .  ,1
rented it last night . the opening       ran waaaaaaaaay too long . the hitchiker scene served no purpose . some skits were just retarded . i knew beforehand  chevy chase was on for less than  minutes . no problem . here are the best parts  br    br   koko  uranus  babs commercial  curtis mayfield song  br    br   total  minutes of good material out of a   minute movie  br    br   everything else was either unfunny or stupid as hell .  br    br   let me give you some advice if you want a crude movie spoofing tv and movies  rent  kentucky fried movie  . if you want a less crude movie spoofing tv and movies  rent  amazon women on the moon  or  uhf   br    br   otherwise  don  t bother renting this movie . you  ll save    dollars .  br    br   imho ken shapiro  s best movie is still  modern problems   ,0
i had seen this film way back in the    s and had nearly forgotten it when i noticed it was on tv again and watched it . i remembered having liked this little sleeper when i first saw it  and i liked it even better on second viewing .  br    br   all of the actors  especially robert duvall  glenn close  wilfred brimley  frederic forrest  and jason presson  as the twelve  year  old boy who feels responsible for the accidental shooting death of his older brother   are superb . the film has a very genuine feel to it   an understated  quiet  deeply moving story of a family aching with grief . the dialogue is sparse but telling  and the nonverbal acting is outstanding . sort of like a simpler  rural version of ordinary people sans psychiatrist but equally impressive family dynamics .  br    br   the stone boy is well worth the time and emotional energy involved in watching it .  ,1
i saw  descent  last night at the stockholm film festival and it was one huge disappointment . disappointment because the storyline was potentially powerful  the prospect of seeing rosario dawson in a smaller intimate movie was exciting and  being a fan  sounds pervy  i  m not   of  rape  revenge  flicks of the    s  i was needless to say very curious to check this movie out . my conclusion let  s stick to the classics  yes  the storyline has potential but the dialogs are flat  the actors unconvincing . even dawson is empty . some would say that it  s a right depiction of the college world in the us  that the emptiness of the characters serve a purpose and all that jazz but it just makes the whole movie unsubstantial . just like the scene where dawson gets raped it seriously lacks intensity  i wasn  t expecting anything  irreversible   style but still  aren  t we suppose to feel compassion for her  i didn  t . not for a minute  she was so lame all the way    and i read that the photography was impressive . well  it is good indeed but nothing ground  breaking either . i must admit that the screening at the festival wasn  t so good so maybe i missed out something here but at the end of the movie  i couldn  t help thinking  i feel like watching argento  s  inferno  again . lol . more seriously  the first scene in the club is beautifully shot and all but i had the bitter sensation of watching a longer and more boring version of the scene in the filthy bar near the american  canadian border in lynch  s  twin peaks  fire walk with me  . . . the crude red and blue lighting  the heavy bass music  the general lascivious  decadent atmosphere . . . no  i just couldn  t get into this movie . too bad .  ,0
there are moments in the film that are so dreadful  your teeth ache . but knowing that there were only weeks left before the code made movies innocuous and bland  paramount rushed this into production before innuendo and leering went out of style . vanities is so horrifically anti  female that it  s delicious . as kitty carlisle sings  women are displayed with price tags that would insult a bronx hooker . they emerge from clams  nudge  nudgewink  wink  in postures of absolute submission . minions of the law  so stupid they cannot find the door  get to look up their skirts and snicker . bare  breasted chorus girls sit uncomfortably in giant cacti  could they be a source of hallucinogens  perhaps   while we listen to  sweet marijuana  and watch as blood falls on a chorines  s breast .  br    br   sure  carl brisson learned his lines phonetically and doesn  t seem to have a clue what he is saying . but it  s all worth it as norma steals the show while no one is looking .  br    br   taking one moment of this fragile fluff seriously is missing the point of the whole exercise . watch this with a charter member of now and prepare to justify the whole hollywood machismo sch tick between body blows .  br    br   toby wing  by the way  is the icing on the cake . and duke ellington doesn  t hurt either .  br    br   a must stroll down memory lane .  ,1
i waited for this movie to come out for a while in canada  and when it finally did  i was very excited to see it . i really enjoyed it . of course  in the beginning  it is a very sad movie  and it was new years day  making it even sadder   however  it sticks with you . the next day i was thinking about it again  because although it revolves around something so emotionally draining  you realize after a few days that it is such a beautiful story . how one person can be seen as the link to so many people  but sometimes you can be blinded so many things . and how diane keaton  s character kind of saves the rest of them by just being there . and how they save her in the process as well . it was such an excellent movie  and chris pine  one of my favourite actors  provides the perfect comic relief . it is definitely a movie that will need a box of tissues  but will really stay with you for a long time .  ,1
futz is the only show preserved from the experimental theatre movement in new york in the     s  the origins of off off broadway  . though it  s not for everyone  it is a genuinely brilliant  darkly funny  even more often deeply disturbing tale about love  sex  personal liberty  and revenge  a serious morality tale even more relevant now in a time when congress wants to outlaw gay marriage by trashing our constitution . the story is not about being gay  though   it  s about love and sex that don  t conform to social norms and therefore must be removed through violence and hate . on the surface  it tells the story of a man who falls in love with a pig  but like any great fable  it  s not really about animals  it  s about something bigger   stifling conformity in america .  br    br   the stage version won international acclaim in its original production  it toured the u . s . and europe  and with others of its kind  influenced almost all theatre that came after it . luckily  we have preserved here the show pretty much as it was originally conceived  with the original cast and original director  tom o  horgan  who also directed hair and jesus christ superstar on broadway  .  br    br   this is not a mainstream  easy  to  take  studio film   this is an aggressive  unsettling  glorious  deeply emotional  wildly imaginative piece of storytelling that you  ll never forget . and it just might change the way you see the world . . .  ,1
to call this anything at all would be an insult to everything else . some expletives might describe it  but still too positively . normally one ignores this kind of rubbish  but it was so stupid that one can but despair . would have though that even americans and commercial tv  stations would have given this piece of st a miss . but as the germans say gegen die dummheit kaempfen die goetter selbst vergebens   ,0

this is a clever episode of twilight zone that was comic rather than strange or tragic . buster keaton is woodrow mulligan  a janitor from     america  works in a laboratory . he is constantly griping about the life problems around him meat is too expensive  it  s like   .    lb . unheard of   . he is always yelling after crazy speeders  on bicycles  autos haven  t appeared yet  . griping to the end  he sees a helmet like device by a scientist  and puts it on and tries it . suddenly he is in modern america . the beginning was a seven minute silent film . now it is all noise  all talking  all beeping  all blowing . keaton is here only a few minutes when he realizes that the world has changed and not for the better . he runs into stanley adams  a professor rollo  who realizes that mulligan is from c .      he mentions president cleveland  . rollo has always wanted to live in that charming  quiet age . he helps mulligan get the helmet repaired  and they go back in time . rollo gets bored after awhile  due to the lack of scientific equipment that he can use . mulligan puts the helmet on him and sends him into the future . but now woodrow is fully content with the quiet  simple age he lives in . he has found contentment .  br    br   in his last fifteen years buster keaton was frequently on television  many times for allan funt on candid camera  where he could help set up sight gag tricks on the public  . he did make a few films as well  most notably a funny thing happened on the way to the forum and the railrodder  . but he occasionally popped up in television plays and episodes . he is in his element here  presumably advising the director  old comedy film director norman mcleod  he directed the marx brothers in horse feathers  on the tricks he could do . watch how stanley adams and he time adams picking him up when he is snatching a pair of trousers he needs . in terms of timing it reminds one of gags he did in the   s in films like sherlock jr . the episode does show keaton in fine fettle for a man in his sixties .  br    br   the appearances of jesse white  here as a repairman  of all things  is always welcome . but look a bit at  professor rollo  . stanley adams was a well known figure in movies and television from the     s onward to his tragic suicide in     . plump  with unkempt appearance  and heavy  booming voice  his best known dramatic role was as the wrestling promoter in the film version of requiem for a heavyweight  he wants anthony quinn to be a wrestler wearing a costume as an indian  . his best known television appearance was as the space trader who introduces the crew of the starship enterprise in star trek to those furry  fertile little creatures  tribbles   as in  the trouble with   . adams was always worth watching  like jesse white  and certainly like keaton   enhancing most of the productions he appeared in . i have never understood his suicide  but it was a sad end to a first rate character performer .  ,1
i will warn you here i chose to believe those reviewers who said that this wasn  t an action film in the usual sense  rather a psychological drama so you should appreciate it on that basis and you will be alright .  br    br   i am here to tell you that they were wrong . completely wrong .  br    br   well  no  not completely it is very disappointing if you are looking for an action flick  they were right about that . but it is also very unsatisfying on all other levels as well .  br    br   tom beringer wasn  t too bad  i suppose  no worse than usual but what possessed them to cast billy zane in this  was it some sort of death wish on the part of the producers  a way to made their film a guaranteed flop  in that case  it worked .  br    br   if they were actually aiming for success  then why not cast somebody who can act  oh  and might as well go for a screenwriter who knows how to write . ah  yes  and a director who knows how to direct .  br    br   as someone who sat through this mess  actually believing it would shortly redeem itself  i can assure you it never did . pity  it could  ve been a good film .  ,0

man  this is a hard dvd to come by . i could only find it on region   a spanish import  and it was expensive .  br    br   was it worth it  well  yes . not so much because it  s a masterpiece of film making  though directed by curt siodmak  the credits on imdb . com read  robert  but the dvd credits list curt   or because it has a couple of familiar figures from other murder mysteries   elisha cook  jr .  and thomas gomez   but because my decade  long curiosity about the movie has finally been satisfied .  br    br   essentially  a respected but self  contained engineer  alan curtis  has been stood up by his estranged wife and finds himself in a new york bar with two show tickets in his pocket . a woman with a strange hat is on the stool next to his and he politely invites her to join him at the musical review . she accepts  a little gloomily . the mopey bartender gives them both the eye as they leave .  br    br   at the show  the tempestuous star notices that this lady in the audience is wearing the same hat and erupts offstage with anger . the drummer in the band  cook  leers at the silent lady but gets no response . curtis takes the woman to her home and asks her name but she won  t give it  and she doesn  t want to know his . if she  d been a longfellow devotee she  d have said something about ships that pass in the night .  br    br   okay  curtis goes home to find his wife has been murdered in his absence . the head police officer  gomez  turns him over to the da . his only alibi is that he was with a phantom lady whom no one else seems to remember   not the bartender  not the latina star  not the cab driver   al alp    not the drummer   and since the lady herself has disappeared  it  s impossible to dig her up .  br    br   curtis is convicted and sentenced to die . but inspector gomez has thought things over and decided her  s probably innocent because nobody with a brain would make up such a stupid story . he joins curtis  s loving secretary  ella raines  in re  investigating the case informally .  br    br   they visit the supposed witnesses again . the ominous bartender is run over by a car  perhaps accidentally  so he  s out of the picture . the hot  tempered latina has left because the show closed and she  s uncooperative and ignorant of the source of the hat anyway . elisha cook  jr .  is strangled by the real murderer but not before he is featured in a scene in which he pounds the drums in an improvised jazz group . his sweaty face assumes an expression which doesn  t suggest intense focus but rather a monstrous  orgasmic insanity . his eyeballs roll to the ceiling  his mouth gapes  his hammering becomes frenzied . i laughed out loud .  br    br   nobody  s performance is otherwise outstanding  but all are professional enough . thomas gomez is always reliable . best performance  though  is probably by franchot tone . he  s the real murderer and he fakes his alibi . he  s reserved and artistic . even when he faints he  s decorous . i don  t know how to put this precisely but tone seems to be thinking as well as simply acting his part . alan curtis as the innocent engineer is near zero on the kelvin scale and belongs in a b picture .  br    br   i don  t know why it  s considered as classic . it  s really your basic murder mystery by cornell woolrich  not as good as some of his others . but siodmak  s direction is sensitive . a man gets run over and his hat winds up in a gutter with water running around it . his use of shadows is quietly effective .  br    br   glad i got it .  ,1
so  steve irwin . you have to admire a man who is not only willing to throw himself into a river that clearly is filled with crocs  snakes  lizards  tons of poop from the aforementioned reptiles  and mud  not only daily  but with enthusiasm . he was never able to make me want to do it  but he managed to make his wife come close .  br    br   this movie does not fall into my parallel universe of film category  the films for people who just had their teeth drilled  have a migraine  or have no film experience and therefore like quiet mediocrity  currently well populated by disney films  . it  s too noisy . well  steve is too noisy . he  s just so happy all the time  and would cut right through the blas  teenager  i can hear it now  that movie was so stupid   or the tylenol with codeine . i  d say his enthusiasm is catching  but if it was  i would own a room full of snakes  and that hasn  t happened yet . i agreed they  re beauties  but i  m still not going to pet them .  br    br   plot was indeed predictable . bad guys were so bad  for a minute there i thought i was shopping at a consumer electronic superstore . but the movie was filled with animals  and steve and terri  which is why i watched it . that plot  if you could call it that  was really more of a reason to throw yet another croc in a truck . my expectations were low and stayed that way .  br    br   i was hoping  though  that there would be a bit of a sequel  where steve and terri  having worked on their acting skills  have a movie with a real plot and more animals with fur . i still can  t believe we won  t see steve anymore . i hope that terri and the children continue to be involved in the australia zoo and the discovery channel  at least . i can  t imagine seeing a crocodile without having some member of the irwin family telling me forcefully how wonderful that croc is . crikey   ,0
this book  based movie is truly awful  and a big disappointment . we  ve been waiting for this move over a month . many film reviewer were hopeful for it . also in newspapers and tv  it made big sense . when   th april comes  many people regretfully noticed that movie is really awful . why  first of all story was so monotone . it has been many indefinite scenes  sometimes it  s hard to realize what  s going on . the actresses  out of hulya avsar  weren  t harmonized with their roles  especially vildan atasever . she acts better in comedy films  in this movie  a kind of drama  she couldn  t disposed of her previous role . and finally movie is too short  just   minutes .  ,0
you know  this movie isn  t that great  but  i mean  c  mon  it  s about angels helping a baseball team . i find the plot line to be hilarious anyways  this kid  s dad says he  ll take him back if the angels win the pennant  because he knows they won  t  kid prays to his fake god to help the angels win  god helps the whole time  via the angel christopher lloyd  rip  and in the end  his dad doesn  t take him back and rides off on his motorcycle right in that kids face . it  s hilarious until danny glover adopts it and it  s friend .  br    br   i guess the upside is that the old lady is left alone to die with her stitchin  projects and her stories . the real winner here  though  is god . because later he got a job as a writer for numerous prank shows .  br    br   as a kids movie  it gets a  . as a movie about the mysteries of blind  stupid faith  and the nature of  god   it gets a   .  ,1
as you all may know  jigsaw did not make its way to blackbuster because of a member of full moon  s own staff  devin hamilton . devin is the one who sells to all of the video chains . he recently released a movie  bleed  which he was selling to blackbuster at the same time as jigsaw . he convinced the blackbuster buyer not to take any jigsaw  and double the number of bleed . the result is that jigsaw looks like a flop  and bleed looks like a hit . the major problem with that is that bleed is one of the worst movies ever  and as we all know  jigsaw is  well  gold . i urge all of you to go on to the bleed page on the internet and vote for the movie that wronged jigsaw  and all of your talents . likewise  you should go to the jigsaw page and cast high votes for it  if you already haven  t  . we need to get jigsaw up to at least an  or  .   and bleed down to around a   thus putting it on the internet  s    worst movie listing  . also  try to convince friends and family to do the same .  br    br   hope you all are doing well   matt  ,0
although  i had no earthly idea on what to expect from this movie  this sure as hell wasn  t what i would have had in mind  had anything actually come to mind . once i heard of its existence  all i knew was that i had to own a movie called please don  t eat the babies . unfortunately  i could only find a copy under its alternate title  island fury . looking back  i guess i could call it a lose  lose situation . on one hand  i still don  t get to be known as the guy who owns a movie called please don  t eat the babies  and on the other hand  island fury would ultimately reveal itself to be an awful  pointless  boring  unwatchable piece of garbage . yeah  definitely lose  lose .  br    br   i  m not even sure what genre they  re going for here . just early    s badness  with a flashback that might actually be longer than the non  flashback . first up  two teenage girls are being chased by two bad guys  once caught  the bad guys bring to our attention that one of the girls have a coin on a string  around her neck  and somehow  these bad guys know of a lot more of these coins hidden on an island somewhere . and this is where things start to get weird  somehow these guys know of a trip the girls took to some island  years earlier  when they were only   . i guess this is supposed to mean that the girls should know exactly where this alleged treasure is . so  now  we  re in the past  while the girls try to retrace their steps  so these bad guys don  t kill them  although  i wouldn  t have minded if they had . in the flashback  the   year old counterparts are on a boat trip with their sisters and the sisters boyfriends  eventually stopping by an island for some air  they get mixed up with some kid and his killer grandparents . any potential suspense or reasons to keep on watching never shows up  but the flashback was undeniably better than the present  which  still  isn  t saying much .  br    br   for a while there i had forgotten about the original story  at one point  i ithought maybe the director had too  and when the flashback ended  that would be the end  which would have worked for me considering this disappointment would have been a half  hour shorter . this pointless movie within a pointless movie does eventually end  and real stuff does happen  but it  s stupid . i guess i didn  t exactly expect a movie filled with infants being devoured  or anything like that  but i did expect some form of outlandish b  entertainment  mostly just a confusing  inept storyline  unsure of its genre . my advice would be to seek out something worthwhile like attack of the beast creatures . if anyone  i would only recommend this one to serious b  movie collectors who must have them all  anyone else interested probably has brain damage . what really gets me is that i still have no idea why they called it please don  t eat the babies .      ,0
this movie was awful . i had a very difficult time watching this all the way through . i didn  t get the point of the movie . what was the point of this movie  the soundtrack was bad  acting was bad and the story uninspiring . the two main characters in the movie were very boring and their dialog was uninteresting . there was no chemistry among any of the cast members . i don  t know this for a fact  but i suspect that most of the actors were first timers . the movie could have easily been cut down to about an hour and half without losing the plot . that indicates how many useless scenes there were in the movie . i would have rather ha a root canal during the two hours of the movie . i want those two hours back  if you want to watch good  funny movie that is family friendly and made by a bunch of mormons  watch napoleon dynamite instead .  ,0
as a guy who has seen all the seasons  i can say that jg constantly surprises me . i mean  after you saw him shifting from laughter to paranoia instantly throughout the seasons and after every little gesture of his made u believe he is a gangster  u thought to yourself ok he is a good actor and he can get into a gangster  s skin . but after seeing him opening his eyes and struggling for his life  i mean i could almost feel the pain he  made  us believe he was going through . i was so touched by his performance that i immediately thought at robert de niro  marlon brando and al pacino . these guys were definitely the best of their generations and even more . but nowadays they are either old or dead  brando  and it  s ok that they make less movies and their performances are  lighter  than they used to be . i can  t wait to see gandolfini in other movies where he delivers a totally different role . can u recommend me some of his older movies where he gives a memorable performance   ,1
i was expecting a b  movie french musical . after all  dhry  blanche  defuns were superstars of low budget french films of that time . and it is in color  but i have hallucination in this unbelievable one hour   of pure mediocrity . musical numbers are awful  and comedy is absolutely boring and stupid . and the songs  what songs  this is just a succession of bad numbers  one after another . the only one very rare thing about that thing is the nudity of women . it was not familiar at that time . in fact  some numbers are just there to show us topless women . it adds to the mediocrity  and try to find young michel serrault  the future great actor of french cinema  in a bit part as a musician  in his very first movie . good luck   ,0

exceedingly complicated and drab . i  m a bright guy  but this was just too much for a tired brain . it would really benefit from a few early clues as to who these people are and what they are doing . probably better for the us market . gc himself hinted that this alone did not supply his oscar and you can see why .  br    br   still the sand dunes are pretty . the nail pulling is nasty . the attorneys drunk dad is a mystery . the cricket is good to see .  br    br   very difficult to write the required ten lines on this  despite it being over  hours long . thank heavens they shortened it . admittedly we don  t get to the pictures much  but the last film we saw  walk the line  was   times better and i don  t really like johnny cash . my wife says george still looks good with the beard and a few extra pounds so there  s that . . . . . am i nearly there yet   br    br   how about now  ,0
i tried to like this program i really did . i even bought the pilot film  first on vhs and later on dvd . however  i couldn  t get into this story because its two main characters  david   bruce willis  and  maddie   cybill shepherd  just seemed to in love with themselves  for one thing . i admit was some clever dialog in the shows  which was a key part of the success of the tv program  and i did appreciate of lot of that dialog .  br    br   basically  this was almost like the old screwball comedy movies of the    s and    s with male versus female . you get lots of arguing  accusations  yelling and screaming . a lot of people apparently love that sort of bickering  but i hate it  so i never got on the moonlighting bandwagon .  br    br   only allyce beasley as the hapless aide  agnes   was entertaining . it  s too bad she had such little air time . shepherd was nice on the eyes and i suppose women would say the same for willis  but too much arguing between the two finally turned me off .  ,0
chan wook park is nothing if not inventive . i  m a cyborg but that  s ok is chock full of amusing little technical flourishes with some ingenious ideas sprinkled in between . attempting to walk in the footsteps of the likes of marc caro and jeunet  city of lost children  delicatessen   park embarks on a fanciful  lighthearted tale which is a radical departure from his usual morbid fare . hardly one to be faulted for his ambition or his vision  it is genuinely unexpected  then  to see all park  s effort add up to so very little .  br    br   i  m a cyborg but that  s ok seems astonishingly to subtract from itself as it goes along  with the the end result being a fraction of the sum of its parts . the premise is promising  gags are copious and offbeat humour abounds but it all fails miserably to create any meaningful connection with the audience . the characters are cute and quirky and played with gusto by the cast  but  try as i might  i could not bring myself to care for any .  br    br   sympathy for lady vengeance was a misstep  indicating perhaps that park was overindulging himself a little bit  but it still managed to showcase some of the director  s unique flare and in the wake of an impressive filmography  was readily forgiven . none of the assured confidence that commanded joint security area or sympathy for mr . vengeance is evident here . i  m a cyborg but that  s ok left me so utterly unengaged i caught myself instinctively fast forwarding from time to time  more regularly as the film progressed  . i gave lady a      and by that measure  this probably deserves no more than a  . for old time  s sake  i  ll be generous      ,0
gung ho is one of those movies that you will want to see over and over again . michael keaton is put in charge of wooing a japanese car company to come to his town thus creating jobs for the residents of hadleyville . what happens after that is one hilarious moment after another . the two cultures clash and it is up to keaton to hold things together . look for great performances from keaton  gedde watanabe  george wendt  mimi rogers  john turturro  soh yamamura and sab shimomo . all are perfectly cast . don  t be fooled by the low number rating . this is a  .  in my book . it is interesting to note that the town name of hadleyville was also used in high noon . yes  there is a real hadleyville but in oregon .  ,1
despite its rather salacious title  this is a light teen dramedy . unless you  re an old coot  you  ll probably find it likeable . it isn  t so good on developing characters or situations smoothly  though . when you view it  you get the feeling that you  ve been running back and forth to the kitchen even if you  ve been sitting down watching the whole time . this is one of those films that counts a great deal on your liking the characters  and they are appealing enough . jennifer connelly is the heartthrob of many  i know  but i  ve always liked the more obscure maddie corman . the teens get most of the screen time without a lot of intrusions from those pesky grown  ups . is it just me or did most of the young males look an awful lot alike   ,1

as is nearly always the case  when britain comes up with an entertaining and  or successful sit  com or quiz show  the yanks will come along and poach the format and produce their own  grossly inferior  version . man about the house is  of course  no exception to that rule . the yanks  version  three  s company  was unwatchable  braindead pap that seem to run forever . a prime example of quantity over  non  existent  quality . the original  on the other hand  is a fondly  remembered gem that had the savvy  like fawlty towers  to pull the plug at precisely the right time  unlike the    episodes of  hilarity  that three  s company came up with  . jo was cute  there was brilliant chemistry between the ropers  richard o  sullivan made it all look so easy  the scripts  whilst not exactly oscar wilde  standard  were consistently funny and chrissy was the most drop  dead gorgeous woman who has walked the face of this planet since the dead sea was merely feeling unwell .  nuff said .  ,1
kirk and crew land on a lonely planet where the sun is about to explode . they intend to evacuate the inhabitants but find the place deserted except for a mr . atoz who operates some sort of high  tech library . despite trying to get a straight answer from him about everyone  s whereabouts  atoz is indifferent to their questions and insist they must quickly  make a selection while there is still time  . they have no idea what he  s talking about but wander about looking at the hand mirror  like disks on the viewers and they see images of the planet  s past . then  while a disk is in the viewer  kirk runs through the doorway and is magically transported back in time to what on earth would look like the time of louis xiv  the     s  . when mccoy and spock follow  a different disk is in the viewer and they are sent to an ice age hell . all too late they realize that the library is a time travel machine and repository .  br    br   while kirk  s visit is pretty short and not all that exciting  spock and mccoy  s is much more eventful  as spock falls head over heels for mariette hartley   who was sent to this awful place as a punishment . the scenes with spock are exceptionally interesting and very atypical of the normally logical guy .  br    br   spock  s departure from the norm  the wildly inventive script and very diverse locales make this an exceptional episode   one well worth seeing .  br    br   fyi   ian wolfe  the excellent character actor  played mr . atoz . i am a huge fan of older films and have seen him as a supporting and bit player in countless films in the   s and   s and he looked almost exactly like he did in this episode from     . interestingly enough  despite looking ancient  he lived on another   years   dying at over   years of age    ,1
this is indeed a treat for every bolan fan  some might think that it  s a little over the top  and that it is only about ringo and marc  s egos  but i think it  s similar to any other concert video  except for the fact that this is marc bolan  not just any guy  i especially liked the music video for children of the revolution  with elton john and ringo starr . this clip alone is worth all the money  i can  t believe they did  not release this version as the single . the movie is really superb  especially for us danes . now  i wasn  t alive during the    s . but danes in general was totally shot out from what was happening around them . the media didn  t play or show any of the popular music back then  including marc bolan and t . rex  they only played a little with the doors  only the really popular songs though . so  i know from my dad  that seeing this  gives him back a part of his youth  he never got to experience .  br    br   i wont make this too long  so . . . if you  re the least bit fan of marc bolan  you need to see this . you might find it boring or as said before  a little over the top . but at least you  ve seen one of the best musicians ever  in action   br    br   only thing that disappoints me a little  is that ride a white swan isn  t on the tape . but i forgive it  since jeepster and get it on are so wonderfully played .  ,1
this film stands head and shoulders above the vast majority of cinematic romantic comedies . it is virtually flawless  the writing  acting  production design  humor and pathos are all wonderful  even the music   from dean martin to la boheme   is captivating and delightful   br    br   every character is peculiarly delightful and memorable  from the leads played by cher and nicolas cage  to the many supporting roles   olympia dukakis  vincent gardenia  john mahoney  danny aiello   even grandpa with his dog pack  each of these performers  plus norman jewison as director  performs above their normal quality in this ensemble work . for several of the actors  this was an early major exposure in film  so the casting is also exceptional   and we have many current acting powerhouses whose careers were altered by their effectiveness in this film .  br    br   i  ve seen this film several times all the way through   which can sometimes deflate the impact of a film substantially . more tellingly  i realized some years ago that whenever i channel  surfed my way into a scene from this film   any scene   the scene was compelling and beautifully crafted . there are so many stunning and memorable scenes the original meeting between the cher and nicolas cage characters  where cage tells his tale of woe vincent gardenia discovered with his paramour at the opera  amidst the splendor generated by his gold  mine plumbing business olympia dukakis scolding john mahoney for philandering with his student in the classic line about liaisons with co  workers  don  t sh  t where you eat    danny aiello at his dying mother  s bedside nicolas cage  taking  cher as the rapture of an aria soars in the background   br    br   there are of course many great romantic comedies  among them sabrina  both versions  but especially the audrey hepburn  humphrey bogart  william holden original   when harry met sally the apartment .  br    br   none quite equals moonstruck   ,1
as an employee of the swedish air force i enjoyed the nice gripen and hkp   mbb bo     flight scenes in this movie . one of the few disappointments was the ews   jammer pod  in this case an inert rb    maverick  missile painted black with the letters  ews    in white along the side . real jammer pods definitely do not look like that  at least not the ones i  ve seen .  br    br   but apart from that  it  s an entertaining movie with a very amusing ending  the last minute  . anyone interested in seeing various swedish military units  including the now  legendary ssg  on film should see this one .  br    br    ,1
screwball comedy about romantic mismatches in new york city . peter bogdanovich is obviously in love with all the women in his picture   he reveres them   yet audrey hepburn is  naturally  put a notch above the others because  after all  she  s the princess bogdanovich probably fell in love with at the movies   years prior . he shoots her in loving close  ups  gets right in the sheets between her and a wonderfully hard  boiled  soft  boiled ben gazzara  and allows her room to sparkle throughout . the love  connections made in the course of the film are fast and amusing  though i did tire of john ritter  s tv  styled klutziness . colleen camp  dorothy stratten  and the grounded  earthy  sensual patti hansen are all exciting to watch . but it  s really hepburn  s valentine and she absolutely glows .  from   ,1

if you ever watched the dukes of hazard you know that you never had to worry about drugs or cussing or crude behavior being seen by young children . if you  ve seen the movie you know that is no longer the case  this movie was horrible  main characters doing drugs and thinking it is funny and cool is certainly not what i call entertainment . they took a wonderful show and just turned it into trash . daisy who was a little flirtatious in the original show now looks and acts like she belongs on the street corner getting paid for her services . i was so excited about seeing this movie before it came out    minutes into the movie i was ready to leave . i stayed thinking it had to get better but instead it got worse by the minute . i wish i had never seen this movie . it trashed a good show and left nothing but horrible taste in my mouth when i left . do yourself a favor  go see something worth your money  cause it  s not only a waste of money but a waste of  hours of your life you will never get back   ,0

first this deserves about  stars due to acting  some which would give me a better subjective opinion and not an objective one as it should by giving this one  well deserved  star  but then i know that those facts are used for the actor  s  names to increase the rating of something like this . . .  br    br   i do have a problem with such productions yet another attempt  just like  untraceable   of a systematic propagandistic feature promoting government intrusion on your rights  how interesting that it comes at a moment when ips providers trying to  preferentiate   censor information  and the americans and canadians are fighting against that at this very moments  . this time is not by labeling torrent file transfers as evil  that one was intended to remind you of such feeling whenever you transfer data on the net   but by literally attempting in creating a sexual frustrated population as a whole . seems like fear promotion is hollywood  s norm this days  especially when coming to thrillers which is the most  on demand  motion picture genre for past  decades or so  most viewed  best way to try influence the society as a whole . such levels of violence are depicted in this  features of morally and  ethical  people  that it gives a new much needed meaning to  anti  heroes  figures . make no mistake  this is not  dexter  which was meant to be high  quality entertainment . stop selling  fear  please  the world would be a better place without it and the dollars made of it .  br    br   the opening scene and generally the first   minutes really give a frightful picture of an erroll babbage that is clearlly suffering of sexual frustration . the way he handles the black male is very disturbing if not outright racist  for sure a  cliche  at least   in real life someone would probably get a beating for it  you will see what i mean  . the second scene  with claire danes  s character present  is even more extreme . at that point i realized  in my opinion that erroll babbage is a very dangerous individual to people around him . how many people  that have seen or will see this movie  have never been  hold down   regarding both sexes  out of self  common gratification   . typically the movie gives an extreme criminal case  that unfortunately did  is and will likely happen again sometime  somewhere  but fingers everyone else indirectly as well as  you could become that   etc . anyone that is familiar with sigmund freud and jung will know very well that sexuality is not something to be judged let alone  asses   by such fanatical  hero  here . safe sex in its many forms is healthy and not some evil that apparently richard gere character is obsessed with  on his way for some sexual  crusade  . have we not learned anything from the abundant recent scandals involving priests and young boys   or for how long an american teenager can see extreme violence on  pg     but he can not even see a woman breast until  r          yet the industry targets them with this very same sexual perversions like  american pie  series for example  . raise the kids tester  one levels but frustrate them and drive them underground in developing fetishes to unhealthy extremes   all sexual activities  upon mutual acceptance  integrates individuals better then some  rightous  nut  case  that blames his misfortunes and shortcomings on  the lives of others   a new german movie that would work great in comparing this  distinct and world apart features on the very same subject  . here  like in that movie  you will probably appreciate the actors for well portraying the opposite of what they should have been .  br    br   i am very disappointed with richard gere especially after the recent  hunting party   a feature where he really shines and about a more realistic  hero   after real facts as well  . but then it just reminds me that all those people are only actors that get paid to play someone  s political and social agenda .  the flock  and  untraceable   heads of the same hidden beast    it just reminds you  if know anyone with similar views on the subject as a whole  as erroll babbage has those here  to stay clear of them for their own safety . they would kill my family faster then any  .      chances of paul jerrod in anyone  s life would . . .  br    br   in the end i recommend this to anyone thinking negative here about my  assesment  of this particular movie  and  untraceable  actually   so you can likely have similar thoughts as i did . nothing sweeter then a propagandistic movie shooting itself in the  foot  .     for once i agree with the rating  this is not a feature for teenagers or kids simply because at best would confuse them even more then the  common  belief of  moneyfamefashion  and how that relates to sexuality .  scream  series and movies as such at least have a defined entertainment value  even if a dumb one in my opinion  . but this one is just another  trust me i know what is good for you  deeply  not so well done i might add  subliminal messages .  ,0

all i can say is  if you don  t fall in love with big and little edie after watching this movie  then you  re not human  even after watching it for the first time  i was hooked . it is a mesmerizing experience that is difficult to describe  as i  m sure other fans will attest to . after watching it  you will cry to think that these two wonderful ladies are no longer with us . at least we have grey gardens to remember them  i think we all long to possess the fierce independence these two ladies were graced with . although i have always admired jackie onassis kennedy  she does not stay in your heart the way big and little edie do . what a rare treat to have know such people i only wish i had   ,1
first of all  i am not a huge fan of contemporary turkish cinema  which is because  the usual pattern of creating a box office success is by hitting below the waistline . this movie is nothing of an artistic masterpiece that deals with taboos  as the director and marketing ads imply . in my mere opinion  the sole purpose of this movie is make money by touching a sensitive morale  in fact it is mostly considered taboo in the native country  cheap populism might provide with a brief definition of what i meant .  br    br   however  the acting is near perfect . in fact  most of the cast has theatrical background and tried hard to compensate for what altioklar lacked talent  all members of the cast were perfectly fit in their roles and well qualified for the job  even the less experienced ones .  like janset  at least  altioklar deserves a small word of appreciation  just because he knows well how to choose the cast . other than that  he is just a media monkey  who presumes himself a director with an artistic talent . come on  art is not something that solely consists of dealing with naked  half naked women . and just because media boasts off  no director becomes a milestone in the history of turkish cinema . just close your ears and o something real artistic  i am waiting eagerly to applause your next work . hope  this time you manage to achieve an artistic approach .  br    br   in short pros  good acting  hot women  just kidding     cons  each and every single thing  other than the cast  ,0
looking back over the past   years  since my first exposure to the show   all i can say is once you get it  it will stay with you forever . i remember my initial reaction being   annoyingly overacted    under produced   unlikeable characters  br    br   well  two years later i watched some episodes again and didn  t find it nearly as annoying . a year later i was able to catch the entire series from the beginning and quickly became engrossed in it  s bittersweet tale of human fault and perspectives on happiness . yes  the show has a style that is not for everybody  and i  m sure the dated production value would be hard to deal with now . but  i still think about the show at least once a month with a vague teary eyed longing for what seemed like simpler times . . .  br    br   btw i am a married man . . .  for all who think this is a show for females   ,1
i would just like to say  that no matter how low budget the film is  it needs to be shown throughout this world the point to these movies . we don  t read that much anymore  instead people want to see movies . having this series out on dvd  has made me want to read the whole series  and want more . please make all  movies . please don  t change any of the characters either  it ruins the effect . because i have grown to love the actors who have played the characters . please make all  movies . i want to see the message  and watch the message that these books and now movies are here to portray . we don  t get that enough anymore . awesome job     ,1
when i first read armistead maupins story i was taken in by the human drama displayed by gabriel no one and those he cares about and loves . that being said  we have now been given the film version of an excellent story and are expected to see past the gloss of hollywood . . .  br    br   writer armistead maupin and director patrick stettner have truly succeeded   br    br   with just the right amount of restraint robin williams captures the fragile essence of gabriel and lets us see his struggle with issues of trust both in his personnel life  jess  and the world around him  donna  .  br    br   as we are introduced to the players in this drama we are reminded that nothing is ever as it seems and that the smallest event can change our lives irrevocably . the request to review a book written by a young man turns into a life changing event that helps gabriel find the strength within himself to carry on and move forward .  br    br   it  s to bad that most people will avoid this film . i only say that because the average american will probably think  robin williams in a serious role  that didn  t work before   please give this movie a chance  robin williams touches the darkness we all must find and go through in ourselves to be better people . like his movie one hour photo he has stepped up as an actor and made another quality piece of art .  br    br   oh and before i forget  i believe bobby cannavale as jess steals every scene he is in . he has the      s leading man looks and screen presence . it  s this hacks opinion he could carry his own movie right now    br    br   s  ,1
i think it  s a great movie . because you get to see how diana  s life at home is . she got so much aggression  and she wants to prove that girls can fight too . i think she and adrian were great actors . because of this movie i am boxing too . it really impressed me . the only negative part i think . is the end . because it  s alright between diana and adrian . but you don  t get to see how it is at home . and i didn  t really like it that you also don  t get to see how her father is doing  and her brother . but i think it was a great movie and i think i  m going to watch it a lot more  i recommend it to anyone  even when you don  t like boxing  you get to see a lot more than only boxing . i had a great time watching it .  ,1
this story is a complex and wonderful tale of the last harem of the ottoman empire  well told and provoking we see the inner workings of a world now gone  and learn about the people who lived there .  br    br   i enjoyed the story  characters  acting and scenes . a few scenes suffered from quick editing and the sub titles sometimes disappeared too quickly  otherwise a wonderful piece .  br    br   the main character safiya is played wonderfully by marie gillain who i am pleased to say did a fantastic job without over doing it . the scenes with her and alex descas  nadir  are charming and lovely .  br    br   i recommend this film for anybody looking to watch something less hollywood and more authentic to the world they are emulating .  ,1
this film is a good example of how through media manipulation you can sell a film that is no more than a very unfunny tv sitcom . in puerto rico the daily newspaper with the widest circulation has continuously written about the marvels of this film  almost silencing all others . coincidentally the newspaper with the second largest circulation belongs to the same owners . the weekly claridad is the only newspaper on the island that has analyzed the film  s form and content  and pointed out all its flaws  clichs  and bad writing .  br    br   just because a film makes a portion of the audience laugh with easy and obvious jokes  and because one can recognize actors and scenery  does not make it an acceptable film .  ,0
may contain minor spoilers .  br    br   dressed to kill  having just seen it for the first time the other day  is a movie with some terrific sequences  some decent performances  and a nice  though obvious hitchcock ripoff  plot twist at the end . it  s just too bad certain things  quite obvious  prevent it from being a classic .  br    br   dressed to kill deals with a mystery of a killer who has slain at least two women  could have been more but the movie never tells us   and the search for the killer by three people a brainy kid whose mom was a victim  a lively hooker whose the only one who can identify the killer  and a psychiatrist whose patient was the slained brainy kid  s mother . there are a host of well done performances including nancy allen as the hooker liz  angie dickenson as the sexually frustrated victim kate miller  and micheal caine as doctor rober elliot whose has more hidden than meets the eye though by no standard is anyone really outstanding . on the other hand denis franz  later to be a great character along the same lines on the hit show nypd blue  is embarrassing as an over  exaggerated  ruthless  hateful detective  though he takes little screen time so it doesn  t hurt the movie that much . keith gordon  the brain child  is decent  but is almost too smart to really be believable .  br    br   what sticks with me the most in the film are the tense sequences . the scene with the sexually frustrated mother at the museum is gripping and well done  as is the later sequence leading to her untimely death . i also love the sequence at the doctor  s office  that reveals the identity of the killer  which really makes the whole film come together at once . and there  s a split screen scene that i thought was almost classic . still there  s another situation when liz is on a train  running from what may be the killer  that gets taken in directions it should never had with almost embarrassing racial stereotypes . as a thriller it  s tense and quite often believable . as a crime drama it often falters  especially with the incomplete  ridiculous explanation of everything that happened in the end . there  s also a needless  and way too long  dream sequence at the end  in which they had the audacity to shoot someone  s foot for what seemed minutes at a time . this was an up and down experience one scene would catch me by the heart and mind with enticement  and the next would make me squirm and ask why . at more than    minutes this could have been under   and been a better film .  br    br   scary movie fans should like this . it still stands as a better film than most of today  s slasher flicks . maybe it was a better film in it  s time  but having just seen it recently i can say i enjoy it  and it is worth watching for my three favorite scenes alone .  ,1
i  m going to say first off that i have given this film a  out of   after some thought . i was going to give it a straight out  but it got a couple extra points for the body count . but that would be about it . let me explain . i paid literally   for this dvd in a supermarket because i tend to have a lot of faith in bargain horror flicks  b  movies especially . but if this film was aiming for b status as i suspect it was for a number of reasons  which i  ll touch on in a sec  then it failed magnificently . not only did it shoot for b and miss  it landed somewhere around f . this film had so many opportunities to be good and it pretty much failed on all accounts . i say above that it  s likely this film was aiming for b status and it seems to try and achieve this by trying to blend humour with horror  which can either be very good or very bad . for example  later freddy films  dream warriors onwards  are all about freddy  s style and nose  thumbing  which works out great  but this film completely bombed in that respect because the times where they tried to inject humour were mostly just stupid . i will admit though that towards the beginning of the film the humour was good . in fact  for about half an hour i liked this film and was prepared to congratulate myself on another good find . but what really killed this film for me was the inappropriate kills . for instance  when  satan  smashes the cat against the board and writes  boo  with it  s blood using its body as a brush . or when  satan  slams the door into the helpless disabled elderly woman . now i  m not usually too against senseless kills in films  hey  thats the point  right  but in those two cases i just found it grossly offensive and unnecessary to anything in the film  plot especially . for me  the film went downwards from then on . one major bad point about this film is that i hated every character in it . the kid  dougie was just ridiculously annoying    i  m at a loss to explain how he could possibly write off all those bodies and people being killed in front of his eyes as a trick  i mean  come on    i completely understand that to be in a horror film a character does have to be somewhat stupid  like running upstairs when you should blatantly be running out of the house screaming for help  but this kid took the biscuit  i wanted to kill him myself by the end of it  it was completely unbelievable and if i had to hear him say  duh   one more time i was going to bang my head against a wall  because thats what watching this film felt like . why didn  t i just turn the film off  mainly because i honestly believe an ending can sometimes redeem a film . but i was wrong in this case . the ending did not redeem this film  it further irritated the hell out of me and was inadequate to the plot line . i get it already  the killer is always going to come back dressed as someone else  be welcomed into the house by the stupid kid and go on a killing spree again because no one suspects him in that costume  i get it  this film made me physically angry because it was so stupid  and if by some foul mistake you do end up watching this film  watch out for the intestines . frankly  if that guy actually did have intestines that looked like that  i  d be surprised he wasn  t already dead  let alone until someones rips them out and ties them to a chair .  br    br   in fact  i  ll even go so far as to say that the only character i liked at all in this film was actually the killer . purely because when his  comedy routine  worked  it did work . all in all  the plot line of this film dragged anything that might have been good down . why was the killer killing  i don  t know . i can live without knowing who he actually was  thats fairly typical  but without some kind of motive  hell i don  t know  i  d settle for him having a bad halloween as a kid   it just seems more than senseless  just stupid . stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid . in fact  i hated this film so much that i specifically registered with imdb just so i could comment on it . save your money  save your sanity . stay away from it   ,0
if you go to this movie expecting something it isn  t  you will be disappointed  as with any movie . this movie contains what hemmingway described as the  iceberg effect  . on the surface  its simply a cache of random movie clips smashed together to make a movie . if this would be written in a book  it would be a short story  because the action in the movie is very fast paced  and unless you actually try to catch it  the reasoning behind the plot  along with some subtle foreshadowing  can very well pass you by . definitely a movie you will have to see twice in order to fully appreciate . experimental cinematography barely describes this movie . the camera  work and post production add much to the overall flavour of the film  making it quite artistic at some points and open to interpretation at others  something to be desired in american movies as of late  . although  at some parts it may get a little raunchy  gruesome and too heavy for some audiences  the movie never becomes completely unrealistic . the only aspect of the movie that i would write off as  needs improvement  is the soundtrack selection . no movie is ever good without a fitting soundtrack  and although the soundtrack is quite fitting  the opening is a little too long  and the other rap songs in the film really could have been replaced with something more appropriate  heavy  grungy rock or psychedelic electronica would have made this film a real trip  . the flooding of imagery and dynamic . . . color palettes adds another  artistic  aspect to it  also combined with the events that happen throughout the film  this is not a movie you can miss any part of and still understand . however  that also makes it much more of a desirable film to watch  and not one you  ll quickly get bored of .  .      ,1
the acting may be okay  the more u watch this movie  the more u wish you weren  t  this movie is so horrible  that if i could get a hold of every copy  i would burn them all and not look back  this movie is terrible    ,0
this cool marvel superhero game pays proper tribute by staying true to the comics . of all the marvel superhero games that have been so lame with weak graphics and gameplay  spiderman improves in both departments . it also features the voice of stan lee  the creator of spiderman comics .  br    br   as you  d expect spiderman does whatever a spider can . he does more than spin webs . in fact  he uses them as weapons and shields . when he  s not using web in combat  he punches and kicks as well . spidey has his hands full as he battles venom  rhino  mysterio  scorpion  and dr . octopus to name a few . look for captain america in a cameo .  br    br   most of the levels are challenging  but some of them require patience to beat . the only complaint about this game is that it  s so short and can be completed in less than three hours . if you  re a real marvel superhero fan  this game is for you but don  t expect long gameplay . better luck in  spiderman  .  my evaluation  out of   .  ,1
the teasers for tree of palme try to pass it off as a sort of allegory for a fairy tale with actual meaning  then immediately start raving about the animation . i should have known what that meant .  br    br   the main character  palme  is a good example of the whole movie  s problem . one minute  palme is a humble hero in search of himself  the next a violent psycho with an unhealthy fixation on a girl he once took care of .  br    br   like all of the characters in the movie  palme is poorly defined . you do not bond with the characters at all  although shatta has acquired a couple of fan girls . it seems that the writer was more interested in cramming all the drama and complexity he could into this movie than actually exploring his characters  motivations and personalities .  br    br   new  useless story lines were being introduced in the last fifteen minutes of the movie . the writer seriously needed to streamline his story . perhaps he was trying to be epic  but it was simply too much information for a two  hour movie . however i can  t help but wonder if a plot with so many dimensions and characters would have been better suited for a tv series or graphic novel .  br    br   in the last five minutes of the movie  i simply could not endure the sheer lack of quality any longer and began laughing at how contrived the characters  the relationships  and the whole plot was . i touched my companion and he started cracking up too  as did a young man seated behind us . we tried so hard to control ourselves  but we simply could not take the terrible quality of this movie .  br    br   on the bright side  the animation is incredible and viewers will find themselves admiring the lush backgrounds and charming character designs . the animation almost guides you when you don  t care about the characters  it tells you how to feel .  ,0
i rank this the best of the zorro chapterplays . the exciting musical score adds punch to an exciting screen play . there is an excellent supporting cast and mystery villain that will keep you guessing until the final chapter . reed hadley does a fine job as don diego and his alter ego zorro . last  but certainly not least  is the great directing team of whitney and english .  ,1
i sat through almost one episode of this series and just couldn  t take anymore . it felt as though i  d watched dozens of episodes already  and then it hit me . . . . . there  s nothing new here  i  ve heard that joke on seinfeld  i saw someone fall like that on friends  an episode of happy days had almost the same storyline  ect . none of the actors are interesting here either  some were good on other shows  not here   and others are new to a profession they should have never entered . avoid this stinker   ,0
walking with cavemen  hosted by alec baldwin  is a look back at all the hominid  that  s us   species of the past  million years who they were  what they were like  and how they died out . along with being a very interesting scientific look at the information we have on these species  walking with cavemen also examines what it is that makes us human . i waited several weeks to watch this  and i was not disappointed .  ,1
jim henson  s muppets were a favorite of mine since childhood . this film makes me feel like a kid again . okay  the muppets are back with miss piggy and kermit the frog and their friends . the premise is that they are trying to get on broadway in a musical show in where else but new york city . you will see cameos by the then new york city mayor ed koch . anyway  the film turns   this year and i hope the kids of today will learn to appreciate the lightheartedness of the muppets gang . the problem with the show is kermit goes missing and the gang has to find him in new york city . it  s worth watching for kids and even sentimental adults like myself .  ,1
this excellent series  narrated by laurence olivier  brilliantly  it should be said  charts the beginning to the end of world war  . the origins are not entirely examined fully from germany  s fall at the hands of the versailles treaty which helped propel hitler  s demonic rise  but as one reviewer says  that must be hard to do  in a    part series with so much to cram in .  br    br   apart from the expected combat photography  action  there are plenty of personal  emotional and human tragedies that are told giving the viewer an amazing insight  especially if you  re not necessarily a world war  buff  fan . episodes showing  testimonies  and what life was like on the home front of the main allies  adversary  britain  germany  japan  russia and the u . s . a . were quite eye  opening . showing the extreme savagery of the war on the frontline and of course the sufferings of civilians  the death camps etc .  were very well handled and exposed . i  d fully recommend this in any history class for the younger generation  of which it could be said i am one at     .  br    br   certain things are quite strangely left out  like the advent of the new jet era beginning  with frank whittle  s experimental gloster jet and the gloster meteor  s combat debut as well as that of the german messerschmitt me     especially as the v   was seen making its debut and there was surprisingly smaller mention of the v  . this is probably a small oversight  not referring to the more sensational secret and fantastic weapons which ww  brought forward from a more barren old science . but a great series that made its mark and has done so ever since when thankfully repeated .  br    br   a series to own as a box set in history terms  on dvd for anyone especially who happens to be a military fan . jeremy isaacs and thames tv should be well proud .  ,1
scientist working frantically in seclusion finds a way to locate the impact crater of a meteor carrying a new radioactive element . all  pseudo  science and breakthrough technology talks of the     s are right there  including the idea that radioactivity could heal any illness if properly harnessed . when he summons his rivals  who had cast him out of the scientific community and ridiculed him  to witness his discovery  they propose a  joint  expedition to africa . . . of course they end up stealing much of dr . rukh  s original discovery  giving him only residual credit . in addition to that  an effeminate weakling who looks like a supporting comedy actor from the worst abbotcostello  lawton  literally steals dr . rukh  s young trophy wife  drake   who falls head over heels for that scrap of a human being . having grown horns like a deer wasn  t going to make dr . rukh  karloff  any friendlier  so he embarks in an undercover revenge mission . . . killing  of his foes and friendly dr . benet  lugosi   the only one who had helped him . . . finally succumbing to the deadly radiations that had allowed him to embark in his revenge to start with but  to my utmost dissatisfaction  sparing the adulteress and that poor excuse for a human being she had married . acting is mostly fine  with karloff  lugosi being very good . check the hysterical chambermaid scene . . . other characters aren  t worth mentioning . . . recommended  much like all old universal horrors . . .  ,1
did the movie  makers even preview this before they released it  the script jumps from place to place without giving much explanation . the beginning doesn  t clarify if its a prequel or not . it starts with superman  s beginnings on earth and then jumps to a point after the last movie  but doesn  t really alert the viewer of this . very confusing  superman himself is weak and in need of prozac . he is portrayed as a potential home  wrecker  a stalker  and someone who is clearly depressed and confused . this type of character rarely makes for an interesting hero . the ending is absolutely ridiculous . superman ending up in a hospital just made me want to kill him off myself . i  m seriously waiting for a snl skit where superman appears on maury povich and maury says   the results are in  in the case of the child  superman  you are the father .  to sum up  ok acting by this superman and kevin spacey  but horrible script . the movie is basically unwatchable .  ,0
yes awa wrestling how can anyone forget about this unreal show . first they had a very short interviewer named marty o  neil who made  rock n roll  buck zumhofe look like a nose tackle . then it was gene okerland who when he got  mad as the wrestler  would say either  were out of time  or  well be right back  acting like he was mad but actually sounding forced . after he went to the wwf ken resneck took over even though his mustache looked like week old soup got stuck to it was a very fine interviewer who  georgeous  jimmy garvin called mouse face which made me fall off my chair laughing . after he jumped ship then larry nelson came on board which he was so bad that phyllis george would of been an improvement  then there  s doug mcleod the best wrestling announcer ever who made every match exciting with his description of blows  then he was offered more pay by the minnesota north stars hockey team . at ringside who can forget roger kent who  s mispronouncing of words and sentences were historic like when a wrestler was big  hes a big  on   punched or kicked in the guts  right in the gussets  or when kicked  he punted him  or  the  piledriver should be banned  after nick bockwinkle used it on a helpless opponent .  right roger like you care   after he left to greener money  wwf  they had rod trongard who  s announcing style was great but different . like when a wrestler scraped the sole of his boot across another guys forehead he  d say  right across the front  e  lobe  or when a wrestler is in trouble  hes in a bad bad way  . he also would say awa the baddest  toughest  meanest  most scientific wrestlers are here right in the awa   no extra money verne gagne   after he left  wwf  larry  wheres phyllis    nelson took over and i would talk to someone else or totally ignore him .  wwe wisely didn  t take him   also greg gagne had the ugliest wrestling boots i ever saw a yellow color of something i don  t want to say . also when hes looking for the tag he looks like he wants to get it over with so that he can run to the nearest restroom  jumpin jim brunzell was such a great dropkick artist that you wonder why greg was ever his partner . jerry blackwell  rip  was also a superstar wrestler but you wonder why verne had himself win against him .  puhleeeeze   then when vince mcmahon would hire gagnes jobbers  he would make most of them wrestle squash matches . i like to see the gagne family say wrestlings real now   ,0
just re  saw this movie after thirty seven years . i was eleven years old and caught this flick on south beach at the long gone cinema theater on washington avenue . in      i thought where it  s at  was a very good movie . now  however  after almost forty years  it  s not as good as it was . times have changed  and this movie is now a tired old re  hash of the war between the generations . it did however  catch a place in time which is just a memory . it  s really interesting to see the mod fashions  the old vegas  a slim don rickles  chain smoking  and a hip opening song . the acting was decent  the script somewhat out  dated  but the memories were still fresh . where it  s at  may not be where it  s at for you  but for me  it was still a nice and entertaining trip down memory lane .  ,1

no spoilers  br    br   being a david lynch film  one could have the idea that it depicts that enigmatic mind of his like the majority of his feature films do . but it is a very straight story as the title might hint . don  t except to be caught in the usual lynchian void of incomprehensibility that usually occurs after viewing i . e . lost highway . it is a simple film but it is indeed a great film . that is both from a innovative and an entertaining aspect . it  s innovative because it so not lynch . but maybe that is lynch . he likes to twist our minds and therefore puts together a film that might seem very mainstream and far from lynch himself . being a very avantgarde director  he might just make a film like this just to tease his regular audience because he knows what they expect but he doesn  t give it to them . that would be crafty .  br    br   the pace of the film is slow . i would almost say lawn mower speed . . . don  t expect an action orgy  but the film is truly entertaining for the ones who go with the flow of the film . look carefully for those small details that lynch plot throughout the movie for our entertainment . look for the great cinematography that makes this film come to life . and listen to badalamenti  s score and the main theme that really animates the iowa and wisconsin landscapes shown frequently .  br    br   farnsworth puts in one of his best performances in this film  making him one of the most likeable ol  men ever depicted on film . he doesn  t have to say anything to express his feelings and thoughts . his cheerfulness just shines right through him and his acting earned him an oscar nomination . need i say that his weak health in this film wasn  t acted  he was diagnosed with cancer and shot himself right after this film was complete . that knowledge just puts more emphasis on the film because it becomes more of a homage to farnsworth .  br    br   all of the above form a very nice motion picture that is suitable for all kinds of people that like a film the way they are supposed to be done . one could ask for homilies that aren  t that obvious and a bit naive but it doesn  t ruin the overall picture  being that it is a memorable motion picture .     .  ,1
all for love  as it titled when it was broadcast at the weekend  is a romantic period drama featuring captain saint ives a french officer in napoleons army who is captured by the british and imprisoned in scotland where he meets and falls in love with a young maiden who visits the prison . theres also a storyline involving a murder .  br    br   i will be honest and confess that i wasnt too taken by the movie since im not much of a fan of period dramas and the screenplay feels somewhat episodic but i will say that this is well acted by everyone involved and its got a good cast that features miranda richardson  anna friel  richard e grant  michael gough and jason isaacs . the costume design as you can expect is also excellent  br    br   ill be very surprised if this movie doesnt get any complaints after being broadcast on bbc  at teatime . captain saint ives lies in bed with a prostitute where a nipple is fully exposed and theres a scene of french prisoners bathing that includes full frontal male nudity not to mention a murder scene where blood is clearly seen . you really do have to worry if bbc schedulers have any type of clue as to what theyre doing  ,0
norman  is that you  was  this is all third hand  so take it with a grain of salt  adapted to an african american family from a jewish one  when it made the transition off stage and onto screen . also  it was one of those movies originally filmed in video  so the prints from the theater can  t have been that great . still  performances by redd foxx and others were pretty good .  br    br   what i wanted to tell you all is that the movie is a period piece it reflected the attitudes in the mid to early   s about finding out you have a gay son or daughter in your family . for that reason alone  it  s pretty interesting  if not a little  hollywood  . don  t believe me  check out lines about curtains  etc . very stereotypical . not too deep .  br    br   but . . . the movie really shines in a couple of areas . there is a side splitting scene when redd foxx is trying to find his wife  who  s run away with his brother    to ensenada in a souped up pinto . the phone conversation across the border is really memorable .  br    br   but . . . the best scene in the movie is when wayland flowers and madame did his  their gay routine that he used to do in gay bars and nightclubs . to the best of my knowledge  this is the only time that routine was filmed . and  it  s a slightly cleaned up and much shorter version  i  m told . still  it  s vintage madame  and shouldn  t be missed . people are still stealing lines from wayland the man was truly gifted . enjoy the movie   ,1
yes  about the only thing this film is memorable for is that it starred a youngish tom hanks who only a few short years later would be a relevant star in hollywood . here though is not a movie that is going to showcase his talents much at all and the only other thing that might be considered somewhat entertaining about this flick is the scene where he thinks he sees a monsters and runs a guy through . yes  this movie is about the evils of playing a game that makes a group of people use their imaginations and try to come up with interesting scenarios . basically  an after school type special about the evils of the game dungeons and dragons cleverly retitled here as mazes and monsters . apparently  the makers of this film thought that nerds should not have fun of any sort unless they were going to go out and do underage drinking  drugs  having lots of unprotected sex and harass other weaker children like all the popular kids were doing . no  these bad people were playing a game that actually required one to use there brain  heaven  s no  not that  if they have a brain they actually may be able to think for themselves and not be brainwashed by certain groups out there . yes  i think this movie is utterly stupid and a waste of time . granted  it could be a movie against addiction  but there are a lot fewer people who died taking dungeons and dragons to far in its entire existence than than say what drunk driving claims in like a month .  ,0
  spoilers     br    br   i wasn  t sure what to think of the movie . not too much of a kids film . definately should be watched with a parent because it includes death and dying . but i was surprised that i was a bit entertained by it .  br    br   i was a bit disappointed by the   minutes of time we had .  even less without the credits  and the trailer gets you to think the rodent is a main creature . but alas  they torture him . right until the end of the movie . those two gripes docked the movie  stars . but i do recommend the movie . even for a sequel .  br    br        br    br   quality     entertainment     replayable      ,1
if you loved long way round you will enjoy this nearly as much . it is educational  funny  interesting and tense . charley shares the screen with two interesting teammates  two tired mechanics  two excellent cameramen and too much russ . ewan makes a few appearances but charley really pulls it off alone . he is funny  engaging and still a puddle of stress and doubt . great stuff   br    br   the series wraps up in  episodes . like lwr  the preparation is nearly as interesting as the race . though they cover the ins and outs of the race well  there could be a bit more explanation of the trucks and cars  which are merely mentioned and rarely even seen racing . it is a motorcycle movie though and anyone on two wheels will love this .  br    br   the series features stunning photography as well as a few interviews of peoples mouths . yikes . there is another extremely catchy theme song like lwr but this one is not nearly as good as the stereophonics .  br    br   if you live in the us god knows when it will be released so buy it on amazon . uk and watch it on your computer as i did . oh  and be prepared to buy another motorbike .  ,1
i  m not a big fan of slasher flicks as a genre  but even by the standards of low  low  budget exploitation  this one is really lame . even on a nudity  and  gore level  it  s incredibly boring  there is some of both  but it  s all sort of . . . meh  . before the home video revolution  it might not even have been released theatrically  though it might have after all  plan  from outer space played in theaters  . there is precisely one good  and competently  delivered  line in the entire movie i assume they stole it from somewhere .  br    br   the acting is among the worst i have ever seen . i mean  even ed wood had a couple of competent actors  and the rest tended to be ludicrously hammy  which can be fun to watch . anyway  most of his actors could pretty much pass as literate . here  those who don  t read their lines like cigar  store indians sound like they learned them phonetically . and this film does have one distinction it manages to be badly underplotted for most of the movie  then laughably overplotted for the ending .  br    br    update i should have singled out the actress playing the receptionist as an exception . she is by no means wooden . not that she  s good  but she certainly isn  t wooden .   br    br   even the worst slasher flicks are generally good for a few puritan meditations on their grotesque offensiveness  but with this one  there doesn  t even seem to be anything there to work up a moral outrage about .  br    br   and you know the funniest thing  they clearly expected to make a sequel   br    br   it  s so bad and boring that it actually becomes fascinating in a weird way . i sat enrapt through much of the video wondering why anyone would go to the bother of making it .  ,0
when i was    grease  was like crack . it was a classless  shameful  euphoric  and powerfully addictive experience . my sister and i would watch it  rewind it  and watch it over again and again and again until we passed out or became too confused and hostile to stand one another . so  if you are an    year old girl  and you reviewed this film as  brilliant  or  fun  or  better than the original grease   you have your fledgling adolescent hormones to blame and you can rest assured that this unyielding fixation with utter rubbish will pass .  br    br   if  however  you are not a little girl  you have absolutely no excuse to suggest that grease  was anything but an inane  artless  slipshod embarrassment for all who participated in its production  distribution  and  or consumption .  br    br   for the sake of criticism  i will dignify the film now by explaining why it blows  br    br    . in a well  executed musical  the songs should advance the narrative or develop the characters . in grease   with a few debatable exceptions  to the music is obscenely pointless . most of the songs appear to relate gimped innuendo about sex in an excessive and general way   score tonight    reproduction    do it for our country   and  prowlin    without making one concrete statement about any of the film  s characters or themes . plus  all of the music is uncomfortably stupid and no one in the cast demonstrates even the crudest semblance of an ability to sing or dance .  br    br    . the t  birds should be badass  and if not at least somewhat likable  but instead each of them is an annoying wussy  dufus  loser . in the end  when johnny nogerelli offers michael the sacred t  bird jacket and initiates him into the gang  michael should kick it to the ground  spit on it  and duck away to fervently scrub any part of his body that was touched by it . but of course  he accepts it as if it is gold because despite the fact that they are a bunch of bumbling meatheads  there is no greater honor than to be one with the t  birds .  br    br    . since michael is beautiful  smart  kind  resourceful  and above average in everyway  his musical impotence notwithstanding   it is feasible that stephanie would ultimately embrace him when he reveals himself to be the man behind the mask . stephanie  on the other hand  is a slovenly  slack  jawed  bubble gum smacking  dirty sweatshirt wearing  gracelessly rude and trashy dingbat . so aside from being pretty  i guess   she harbors no likable characteristics  thus  audiences are given no justification whatsoever for the depth of michael  s attraction to her .  br    br   i could go on and on  but i didn  t want to mention the gross inferiority to its predecessor since there are apparently so many cranks out there who seem to feel that such a comparison is unfair . i will say this though  to those of you who think you want to revisit this mess for old time  s sake grease  is an experience akin to re  living your first kiss . only you are   now and kissing a snot  nosed    year old kid with acne and slobby braces . the magic is gone and you are left feeling dirty and disturbed . trust me .  ,0
and laugh out loud funny in many scenes .  br    br   the movie  s basic plot is well chronicled  a story of opposites trying to find a way to survive each other in close proximity .  br    br   this is unquestionably lemmon and matheau  s best film as co  stars  and the interaction between the sloppy oscar and the ocd felix are classic .  br    br   the scene where oscar lines up a double date  leaves the room briefly  and comes back to find felix and the two girls all crying is pricelessly funny .  br    br   for any fan of intelligent comedies  the odd couple is a  go out of your way to see it  film .  ,1
this series got me into deighton  s writing and the genre when i was younger and i love this presentation of the story . i would however disagree with the above comment . from what i have read in the past  it is not holm  s performance that lead deighton to refuse to have the series released but the butchering that all three books received in the translation to the screen . a great example of this is the rewrite of the boarder crossing that ended samson  s field career . the scene is not in the book  the character who dies in the minefield was never in any of the books and the crossing in sinker was from east germany to west germany  not the polish frontier . this whole storyline is cloth . the changes in set similarly damage the integrity of the story . my perspective on holm  s performance was that he portrayed the disorientation of samson during his wife  s defection excellently and i believe comported himself well in portraying the aging field agent desperately trying to bridge the class divide . samson both pays for his father  s idealism and suffers due to its influence on his life . as clevemore comments  had he gotten himself an education he would have probably been running the department . i think the true loss of performance is due to physical appearance more than anything . holm is diminutive when compared to the samson of the book  a physically impressive man capable of using his size to impose a presence .  ,1
oliver  the musical is a favorite of mine . the music  the characters  the story . it all just seems perfect . in this rendition of the timeless classic novel turned stage musical  director carol reed brings the broadway hit to life on the movie screen .  br    br   the transition from musical to movie musical is not an easy one . you have to have the right voices  the right set  the right script  and the right play . all signs point to yes for this play . it almost appears that it was written for the screen   br    br   our story takes place in jolly old england where a boy named oliver manages to work his way out of the orphanage . he winds his way through the country to london where he meets up with a group of juvenile delinquents  headed by dodger  the smart talking  quick handed pick  pocket . the leader of this gang is named fagin  an older fellow who sells all the stolen goods .  br    br   but all is not well in london town when bill sykes played by oliver reed and his loving girlfriend nancy get tangled up with oliver  fagin and his young troops  and the law . what ensues is a marvelous tale of love  affection  and great musical numbers .  br    br   whether or not you like musicals or not  one listen to these tunes and you will be humming them all day long . oliver  is a triumph on and off the stage and is a timeless work of art .  ,1
this italian film from the     s is not even in the class with dog soldiers  the howling  or even that awful american werewolf in paris  but . . . it is fun to watch . i  m talking about watching the lead actress  a stunning blonde  run amok in her birthday suit . we  re talking about graphic  complete nudity . . . it  s obvious that she is a real blonde . . . humma humma humma   the story is a hoot  the sfx are childish  and the acting  for the most part  stinks . the only redeeming value of this movie is all  and there is a lot  the nudity  sex scenes . tame by hbo standards  but still fun to see when you find yourself without a date on saturday night . ok . . . here  s the spoiler . . . there is no werewolf  except in the opening scene of the heroine      s ancestor . the girl just imagines that she  s a werewolf . . . in other words  a clinical lycanthrope .  ,0
i  ve now watched all four bo derek vehicles directed by her husband  john all are quite terrible  of course  but this is certainly the pits . featuring the usual flimsy plot  bad scripting  by the director  naturally  and acting  not to mention gratuitous nudity by the star  it deals with her losing much older husband anthony quinn  she accepts his shotgun suicide by saying he had always admired hemingway    but who continues to appear and talk to her . in fact  he wants to come back in another  younger bodybut actually does so only in the very last scene  derek is lovely as always  and still playing nave     especially during a muddled mid  section which has her pursued by a hired killer at a spa . quinn  too  is typically larger  than  life  read hammy  here  but this easily constitutes his nadir besides  for much of the duration  he acts from behind a piece of shiny plastic  presumably suggesting his being in some sort of limbo   his  replacement   then  is obviously a handsome  looking stud who hasn  t a lick of talent or even personality . also featured in the cast are hollywood veterans don murray  as quinn  s best friend and bo  s business consultant  and julie newmar  as quinn  s guardian angel in the afterlife   plus a surprising cameo appearance by billionaire donald trump  who presumably needed this on his resume    it also goes without saying that john derek was his own cinematographer on the film  that the end credits are filled with useless  and corny  expressions of gratitude to the many people who lent a helping hand  and that ghosts can  t do it swept the board at the     razzie awards   ,0
filmfour are going to have to do a lot better than this little snot of a film if they  re going to get the right sort of reputation for themselves .  br    br   this film is set in glasgow  although only a couple of secondary characters have anything approaching a scottish accent  . the premise  about people who  s lives are going nowhere  who all meet up in the same cafe in the early hours of the morning as they have night jobs  could have made for a really funny  insightful  quirky  cultish film . instead we have a group of self  obsessed saddos and a plot which has been so done to bits i  m suprised it hasn  t been banned . x and y are friends . x is sleeping with z . y sleeps with z as well . oh you figure it out .  br    br   a total waste of time . painful dialogue  it sounded like something that a group of   year olds would have written for a gcse drama project . the female character was completely superfluous  just written in as a token female in the hope that women would be cajoled into seeing it .  br    br   if you  re the sort of thicko lad who laughs at beer adverts and can usually be found wandering round in packs shouting on saturday nights in nondescript town centres then you will love this film and find it  a right laff  . everyone else  run  don  t walk away from this sorry little misfit .  br    br   and one question  when the group left the  boring  seaside town  saltcoats incidentally although they changed the name on the film   to go back to glasgow  why did they do it via the forton motorway services at lancaster which is in england   ,0
honestly  when i saw this movie years ago i immediately wanted to turn it off . as i sat there for the next   minutes or so  i realized that the actor playing navin stole the show . his facial expressions and comedic demeanor makes me shake my head as to why he hasn  t been in more comedies . he has this  marty feldman  thing going for him but much  much more talent . . . taking nothing away from marty . the movie really shocked me by how close it was to the original jerk  but then again  it was so much more . i really think that if this movie was released first  and i saw the steve martin movie  nd  i  d think the  nd was a cheap rip  off . i know it sounds like a bold statement  but it  s true . i actually like steve martin a great deal  but his performance is  nd to the actor in the jerk too . i wish i could get a copy of it for my collection . i urge you to see it if you can find it .  ,1
back in the day of the big studio system  the darndest casting decisions were made . good old all american james stewart appearing as a hungarian in the shop around the corner . had i been casting the film  the part of kralik would have been perfect for charles boyer . his accent mixed in with all the other european accents would have been nothing . stewart had some of the same problem in the mortal storm also with margaret sullavan .  br    br   margaret sullavan was his most frequent leading lady on the screen  he did four films with her . but is only this one where neither of them dies . sullavan and her husband leland heyward knew stewart back in the day when he was a struggling player in new york . in fact sullavan  s husband was stewart  s good friend henry fonda back then .  br    br   i think only clark gable was able to carry off being an american in a cast of non  americans in mutiny on the bounty . stewart in the mortal storm was german  but all the other players were american as well so nothing stood out .  br    br   but if you can accept stewart  than you  ll be seeing a fine film from ernest lubitsch . the plot is pretty simple  a man and woman working in a department store in budapest don  t get along in person . but it seems that they are carrying on a correspondence with some anonymous admirers which turn out to be each other . also employer frank morgan suspects stewart wrongly of kanoodling with his wife .  br    br   though the leads are fine and frank morgan departs from his usual befuddled self  the two players who come off best are felix bressart and joseph schildkraut . bressart has my favorite moments in the film when he takes off after morgan starts asking people for opinions . he makes himself very scarce .  br    br   and joseph schildkraut  who is always good  is just great as the officious little worm who is constantly kissing up to frank morgan . you really hate people like that  i  ve known too many like schildkraut in real life who are at office politics   hours a day . sad that it pays off a good deal of the time .  ,1
running out of films to rent  i picked up freebird . i struggled through the first third of the movie wondering if the rest would be a waste to see . fortunately  it really warmed up  and i loved the movie quite a bit . the second half of the movie had me grinning and laughing the entire time . thankfully  although there were bits of cgi included  they were not overdone or prevalent .  br    br   i would have to say  though  the actors all have heavy european accents  so be warned if you have trouble understanding those voices or their cultural humor .  br    br   i really loved this movie  and will have to order myself a copy for my own collection .  ,1
as with many other pop  culture franchise series  this line just didn  t know when to quit . instead of leaving things as they were perfectly ended  they went on to generate this the first installment of this franchise to fall sorely short of the mark .  br    br   this movie should never have happened . it was not intended for there to have been a fourth movie in this line  and it sure shows . the premise is idiotic and the portrayals were the same .  br    br   after the wonderful experience which was the omen  this was a major disappointment which stank of    s cheese and horrible acting . it was reminiscent of the amityville horror in those aspects  and left a terrible  lingering stench long after it was over .  br    br   it rates a  .     from . . .  br    br   the fiend  .  ,0
a failure . the movie was just not good . it has humor that  year olds that will not even giggle at . i mean  sure  some parts were amusing  but most of it is not . lindsey lohan is a great actress  and a bad singer   and she should be working on better movies . the movie should have been aired as a disney channel original movie  that is free .  br    br   the only thing that was well done about this movie was the music . nothing like a remade rock soundtrack to brighten up your day . these songs are so good . especially alyson and amanda  s walking on sunshine and caleigh peter  s  beach boy song  fun fun fun .  br    br    out of   . if i gave it a ten   of that would be the music and  will be the movie . not worth your money  but the soundtrack is .  ,0
i  d heard of eddie izzard  but had never seen him in action . i knew he was a transvestite  and when i saw he was on hbo one night last summer  i put it on  not knowing how my husband would react . well  he blew us away . he  s better than robin williams ever was . he has total control of the audience when he does the  englebert is dead  no he  s not   routine  the audience doesn  t know what to think by the end . god as james mason is also an inspired touch  and his version of the python spanish inquisition as carried out by the church of england   cake or death   is priceless . my jaws were aching from laughter by the end of the show . we scoured the tv listings for months after that to be able to see him again  and were lucky enough to tape him the next time he came on . if you get the chance to see this show  cancel everything and tape it  you won  t be disappointed .  ,1
the only redeeming qualities this movie has are the fairly original death scenes . other than that this movie is a big dud . we have kim basinger  the beleaguered housewife slowly meandering thru the local mall for the first   min . of the movie  which added nothing . then the movie picks up a bit as she has a confrontation with  punks who took up  parking spaces on this busy xmas eve . they begin to chase her after offing the local security guard who tried to help her . from there this movie gets worse  way worse . i know its only a movie and you  ve gotta go with the flow but she  s got about a  min . headstart and she can  t hide or find someone to help her . instead she drives to a half built subdivision beside a forest . in typical fashion she does everything she can to allow her followers to easily track her . but now she turns into one tough mofu . you get the point . do not under any circumstances buy or rent this movie no matter how much you like this type . it  s so illogical you  ll be questioning every scene . it is embarrassing for basinger and craig sheffer and the rest of the cast  as well as the consumers .  ,0
this is not as bad a movie as some reviewers  and as the summary at the imdb page for this movie  say it is . why  first is the fact that in     the movie makers were daring enough to confront  as one of the plot elements  the issue of domestic violence   so reviewers who complain about the plot are sadly missing one of the main points  second  without the plot element of prince  s movie relationship with his abusive father  the musical climax wouldn  t work as well as it does   so those reviewers who say that only the music is good have  once again  missed one of the points   specifically  why it is so good . . . because all of the music in this film has a plot element backdrop that makes the music more effective . third  give this movie a break  for first  time movie producers and director  this is just not that bad  there are far worse movies out there by accomplished movie people   and last  the reviewers who say that the music is  good  have also missed the point   check out the range of stylistic musical treatments  the variety  the musicianship  and the stage performance of prince   truly one of a kind  going musically where no one else was going during the      s  and with a style seen in the work of other artists  clothes and movement which costuming elements came first  michael jackson  s or prince  s  also  see if you can spot the splayed fingers sweeping in front of the eyes that prince does in this movie  long before quentin tarentino  s  pulp fiction   . as the sum of its parts  not a bad movie at all .  ,1
if it wasn  t for some immature gullible idiot i know insisting that i watch this  documentary  i would never have seen this comedy  this film is full of bad scripting and laughable moments . one in particular is where the afghan police  soldiers arrest don larson for filming in the streets while they allow the cameraman to carry on filming his arrest and then drive away  still filming  presumably to his plush hotel . then there  s the scene where a car crashes into another car which has been turned upside down and parked nicely on the side of the road without any evidence of it being in a crash or explosion .  br    br   i am surprised this has currently got the rating it has   .      . i thought imdb users had more sense .  ,0
the entire      minute presentation is done in a very non  threatening and non  medical way that even preteen children can easily understand . it dispels many of the myths surrounding menstruation that were going around in those days       while sex is not explicitly mentioned  the part about fertilization is . this is also  purportedly  the first hollywood production to ever use the word  vagina  in the dialogue .  br    br   it is cute how the animated character is shown topless in the shower in a purely animated character way with no defining features as was the way of the day . many of the betty boop cartoons showed her undress without revealing any defining features either . max fleischer was a bit of a card and did this with many of the betty boop cartoons which required frame  by  frame viewing to find them .  br    br   there is no mention at the beginning or end of the film as to who the female narrator is . in fact  there are no credits whatsoever other than those mentioning kotex and kimberly  clark corporation .  br    br   this title is nearly impossible to attain but for those who are bittorrent downloaders  it can be found out there in the ether . this is one of those  keepers  that will become increasingly hard to find as older short subject features fade into obscurity .  ,1
ok  honestly i dont see why everybody thinks this is so great . its really not . there were two good things that came out of this movie  . jack  s performance  he was very good i can tip my hat for him .  . danny  s performance  he was good . no other then that it got pretty stupid . and  what was stanley kubrick thinking drafting shelly as the wendy  she was so bad . she looked the same every time she got scared . the problem with this movie was the ending . i would have had more respect for it if kubrick would have ended it differently . and  the over all movie was just stupid . the problem with the movie is that the book was so much better . so dont see the movie read the book and you will be much better off .     .  ,0
ying  a chinese girl who speaks czech  invited us to screening of a czech movie  with english subtitles  in the department of visual and environmental studies  ves  . it was the first time i saw samot    i  loners       and it was pretty good .  br    br   much like in many other czech movies  the seven central characters seem to have a pretty difficult  dirty life the web indicates that this theme was popular among the u . s . movies in the early     s . their relationships are breaking up  combining  and recombining . another typical feature of the czech movies is that neither of the characters is designed to be a universally negative one and neither of them is a permanently positive character either . also  you can see how the characters judge the features of others depending on the context that  s a very realistic feature of the movie  s psychological analysis .  br    br   ond    ej is a talented and married young surgeon who has two daughters . nevertheless  you learn that he has only studied neurobiology to prove how much he loved another woman  hanka . he is so obsessed that he repeatedly dresses up as a plumber to get into hanka  s parents  house  a house that he repeatedly burns .  br    br   meanwhile  hanka has a very mixed relationship with her parents . she just decides  by tossing up a coin  to break up with petr who works in a private radio station . hanka does not view her parents  bourgeois life as a good example but seems rather unsuccessful in creating a better environment . but she is a very flexible figure  as far as the type of her boyfriends go .  br    br   for a while  hanka seems to have serious plans with jakub  an innocent drug addict whose memory seems to be rather devastated by the drugs . however  the friends from his band inform jakub that he already has another girlfriend . hanka is disappointed and returns to her parents .  br    br   when hanka and petr break up  it is organized by robert  a matchmaker who also works for a travel agency where his job is to show the life of ordinary czech people to japanese tourists . robert  who also provides jakub with marijuana  is never serious about anything and he usually sleeps with many different women eventually  his mother dies in a hospital and he has his own ways to deal with the depression .  br    br   vesna  a slavic word for  spring   who came to prague from macedonia works as a barmaid  and you won  t learn whether she came to czechia in order to see her dad or ufos . she seems pretty confused but sometimes helps the other characters from their problems .  br    br   petr works in the radio station and he is the only one who likes his job  a job that he eventually loses . he announces to his audience that he broke up with hanka  which is how ond    ej learns about the news that make him very happy .  br    br   finally  ond    ej  s wife lenka is always ready to forgive him and stabilize their marriage  even after ond    ej asks a magician to make him disappear so that ond    ej can try to capture hanka again .  the magician pays his debt because he is a brother of a victim of an important car accident  jakub and hanka bring the victim to the hospital and ond    ej saves his life .  lenka also works for the travel agency  as a translator  and eventually she has to translate some hysterical scenes for   or so japanese tourists who are shooting their movies during hanka parents  dinner .  br    br   the seven characters interact in interesting and exciting ways that would be natural if prague were smaller by four orders of magnitude . given the actual size of the czech capital  it looks a bit unlikely that all these events would take place among seven people  but it is fun .  ,1

so they hyped the violence and it  s been branded as sick . well  the violence is the best bit i  m afraid  but unfortunately the characters are not developed enough to allow us to understand why they go on their  entirely predictable  rampage . this film has a truly dreadful script . we never get a chance to get to know robert and his actions at the end are just plain pathetic . the acting isn  t much better  either  the worst of them being the tv chef and the school teacher . the direction is clumsy  the pace enough to send you to sleep . and what on earth is the school film project all about  a comment on the film itself perhaps  the use of newsreel during the climactic murder is laughable . these guys obviously think they  re intellectuals but are hopelessly out of their depth . how on earth they got the great yorgos arvanitis to light it i  ll never know . and how they got the money to make it in the first place is an even greater mystery . absolutely awful beyond comprehension .  ,0
this is really a great unknown movie . perfect dialogue without the typical clichs . this movie relied on the actor  s talent and it was pulled off . it even had a little bit a comedy in it  but it wasn  t overdone . once in the life is what a crime drama is supposed to be  not the typical special affects garbage with sex thrown in . i especially loved the interracial aspects of it all .  br    br   now onto the actors themselves . laurence fishburne was superb at playing a career petty criminal . it  s a shame that he  s only allowed to show his talent in his own movie . titus welliver was fabulous as fishburne  s junky half  brother . eamonn walker added flavor to the already perfectly spiced film . paul calderon was perfect as a grease monkey  drug lord . i loved his acting since  king of new york  . but the best acting in this film came from gregory hines and michael paul chan  who were paired perfectly as two of calderon  s henchmen .  br    br   once in the life is for sure a keeper .      out of  .  ,1
i saw this recently on a faded old vhs tape  and remembered it dimly . looking at it now  it seems charming .  br    br   when it was first released  it was recognized by pretty much everyone as a spoof of coming out as a gay teenager . to hammer the point home  the mother is seen reading a paperback copy of   teenager in     the most popular coming out book of the time . david warner hams it up as the persecuting vampire hunter  gay  hating evangelist  who is of course a self  loathing closet case . the list of sight gags and in  jokes that were included to make sure nobody missed the point would be too long to go into . the producers were having some good  natured fun  and hoping  no doubt  to lighten  up as well as to enlighten .  br    br   but i have no clue how a teenage audience would look at this film  nowadays . in some places  where there is education and culture  the terrifying ordeals that gay teens had to go through are a thing of the past . but i  m sure there are plenty of dark  nasty corners of our continent where it  s just as bad as it always was .  ,0
you know  i went to see  the hills have eyes   wanting to like it . i really enjoyed the original  and the remake was fairly entertaining . they obviously had more money to throw around than wes craven did on special effects the second time around . even though i still prefer the original film  the remake was done well  and it was kind of a guilty pleasure for me . bloody  intense  and great special effects . in short  a great popcorn movie for any horror fan .  br    br   which brings us to  the hills have eyes   . man  where do i start  the plot  or lack of one  is paper thin . we are not exactly breaking new ground here . the military has decided to monitor the area  and all of these people turn up missing . so what do we do now  let  s send in the national guard to investigate . in true hollywood fashion we need to make them the dumbest  and worst soldiers ever seen . gee  i  ve never seen that premise before . to make a long story short  you have the mutants killing off the moron soldiers one at a time in graphic fashion . once again the special effects by nicotero are great  but the kills no matter how graphic become boring  and predictable . honestly it seemed to me that this flick was done just to grab a quick buck . it was bloody  and graphic  but i found it predictable  boring  and not scary at all . for me it would have been nice if this film contained one original thought . wes craven and his son shared the writing duties  and he has been involved with many of my favorite horror films  but sadly this isn  t one of them .  ,0
this dumb comedy really does a good job of wasting comedic talent . in particular  dan aykroyd and howard hesseman are misused badly here . i might have chuckled once or twice during this film  but in general  it  s a boring movie  with a little bit of stupidity thrown in for good measure . the premise  although routine  still wasn  t bad  but once the plot was set  the film went nowhere . don  t waste your time with this misfire .  ,0
they changed the title of this atrocity to an unexpected love . the only thing worse is the film itself . the script contains dialogue that would be laughed out of a third grade play recital . at one point when the wife leaves the husband  a bad cover of all by myself plays over the soundtrack  no kidding . the actors try but are defeated by the inept  unbelievably terrible script . direction is staggeringly bad . no wonder lifetime has such a bad reputation . how do things like this get made . i  m turning off the television before it  s over   ,0
well . . . overall  this movie was pretty much worthless  and it  s basically a horror movie that ended up being more of a comedy . i just rented this movie last night when me and my friends went to blockbuster looking for a scary movie . this definitely wasn  t what we were looking for  but it satisfied us for humor . the actors in this movie  especially brandon  are so fake that it  s funny . and especially that tracy girl whenever she  s in the boarded up room telling the clown to go away . they show almost no emotion and it  s just so obvious that they  re acting . and also when the clown is looking through that black box paper thing and grabs mark  he doesn  t even look like he  s scared even though the clown like grabbed him and started attacking him . and seriously  would you just be jogging if you were being chased down  i  d be sprinting for my life   even though anyone could probably outrun that clown because he  s like    lbs .  not to mention that the effects aren  t that great  like whenever the clown chops off susan  s head in the forest  then whenever he throws her head into the boarded up room with denise and tracy whenever denise throws the head back over . also like in the previous guy  s comment  the beginning makes absolutely no sense and i don  t even see why it was even included in the movie . so what  was this movie made in      the music made it sound like it was made in like the      s  and the camera  ing    doesn  t even really look professional . half of the time  it seems like the camera can  t even stay steady when it  s suppose to be . overall  i  d have to say i enjoyed the movie . i wouldn  t recommend it though if you  re trying to find something to scare you  but if you  re looking for something to maybe make fun of or get a laugh out of  i  d recommend it for sure .  ,0
i just saw this last night  it was broadcast on the canadian broadcasting corporation  s  passionate eye  series . it has been screened recently  sept .      at the toronto international film festival as well as many others . it is a quite remarkable film . the filmmakers literally stumbled into the story  being there to make a documentary about chavez himself . instead  they found themselves squarely in the middle of events as the coup unfolded . they had unprecedented access to events and people and  for the most part  let the story unfold as it happens . they  of course  have their own ideological perspective  which they make evident  but they keep themselves in the background and instead try to focus attention on the events  the people  and the background and history leading up to the coup . as a film  it is not ground  breaking in a stylistic or aesthetic sense  and that is  i think  the way it should be . what we get to see what  embedded  journalism should really be . what we get to see is a remarkable account of a country struggling to attain democracy . . . a charismatic leader  chavez  who actually cares for his people . . . a story about power and greed as a coalition of corporate  military  media interests combine to lead a coup of a democratically elected leader . . . and unprecedented access to a historical event as it unfolds .  br    br    ,1
the underground comedy movie  is possibly the worst train wrecks i  ve ever seen . luckily i didn  t pay for this movie  and my friend reluctantly agreed to watch it again siting that it was so awful but he needed to prove to me how awful it was . i love off color comedy . i figured at the least it would have that and i would be entertained . no  instead the acting was so awful  the  jokes  were extremely cheesy  and the plot was no where to be found . maybe there wasn  t supposed to be a plot so i can  t hold that against this movie . it  s pretty sad where the funniest thing in a comedy is an old woman having her head hit off by a bat . . . . . by batman . . . a man dressed in a baseball uniform wielding a bat . hilarious . simply genius . i got the feeling watching this movie that its creators made it and laughed hysterically with their friends about it . perhaps this was full of inside jokes we just didn  t understand . or perhaps it  s the worst piece of trash ever made and it should be locked away in a vault and dumped in the arctic ocean .  br    br   p . s . don  t buy this movie   ,0
the flock is not really a movie . it  s a wannabe movie  with wannabe actors . not including richard gere  he gave an excellent performance  but when only one of the actors truly gives himself to his character  and the rest of the cast is just acting . . . the result is pathetic  just like this movie . you see  the idea of acting is to hide the fact that you  re acting . what the hell was claire dains doing in this one   she  s the most inappropriate actress for this character . in   .   of the movie she looked extremely out of place  out of everything   the only thing she was doing was asking stupid questions  like  do you really think so     and making silly faces . i was embarrassed by her acting  seriously  and i used to like her . . . she  s the romantic movie type  i don  t know who picked her among all the actresses out there . . . . lol  and seeing avril lavigne   this really made me laugh . . anyway . . if you want to get the feeling of throwing up  this movie will do the job for you    i wish i could vote   . .  ,0
i had never heard of this one before it turned up on cable tv . it  s very typical of late   s sci  fi sober  depressing and not a little paranoid  despite the equally typical inclusion of a romantic couple  the film is pretty much put across in a documentary style  which is perhaps a cheap way of leaving a lot of the exposition to narration and an excuse to insert as much stock footage as is humanly possibly for what is unmistakably an extremely low  budget venture  while not uninteresting in itself  the  apocalypse  via  renegade  missile angle later utilized  with far greater aplomb  for both dr . strangelove       and fail  safe        and mercifully short  the film  s single  minded approach to its subject matter results in a good deal of unintentional laughter  particularly in the scenes involving an imminent childbirth and a gang of clueless juvenile delinquents   ,0
excellent view of a mature woman  that is going to lose everything  even the pruner has a mortgage  . the way she gets involved into this special  business   the innocence  and the true love that exists between the people of a little town  it  s mixed perfectly to give us as result a fresh  light and funny comedy . i couldn  t stop laughing with a very funny scene of two old ladies in a drugstore .  br    br   i love european films  and with movies like this one  my opinion grows stronger . a movie that i also recommend with my eyes closed  in this same genre  is waking ned devine .  br    br   saving grace  a comedy that many friends enjoyed as much as myself . you will love it .  ,1
my comment would have been added to the release date section  but i couldn  t find a place for it . i was really surprised to see that this movie was released in the u . s . in feb .      . i saw it in a  first run  theater in washington  d . c . in march      . wonder if it was re  released  or some problem  in my opinion  this movie is very light entertainment  but has some classic characters . john mcintyre does a bang  up job as a corrupt judge  entrepreneur  thief . walter brennan does basically the same role he did in red river years earlier . and  in my opinion  james stewart gives as fine a performance as he ever did . i have seen this movie a half dozen times or more  and never tire of seeing parts of it again . the photography and scenery are splendid  and it offers a remarkable amount of entertainment in one hour and thirty  six minutes .  ,1
war is hell . but this documentary of wwii is heaven .  br    br   not only is this series a breath  taking  almost  exhaustive look at the second world war  it  s a poetic masterpiece told clearly and superbly by laurence olivier .  br    br   this documentary series defines the genre . it  s sweepingly long  no doubt  but you will enjoy all of them and want to come back for more and more .  i have the series on dvd and i probably watch the series three times a year  .  br    br   truly  this is an impeccable bit of film  making . other than olivier  the best part of the series is listening to the veterans tell their stories whether it be about an actual battle or about finding a hog to butcher so they could have something delicious for supper .  br    br   i  m going to go watch it right now  again  my . . .   th time  .  ,1
love at the top   the utterly wrongheaded american title for the superb french film  le mouton enrage   which means  i think  the rabid sheep    is such an original movie  the fact that it dates back to     seems all the more astounding . this film was far ahead of its time even by today  s highest standards  it accomplishes things that seem rich and new . filmed by the hugely underrated director michel deville  it rather defies description in the way it combines social critique  comedy  mystery  love  sex and satire into one wholly original mix   leaving for the end a major but subtle surprise to render all that has gone before suddenly sad and more understandable . the cast is splendid  ditto the writing and theme . but it  s deville  s delicious tone  keeping you constantly off  balance but enrapt  that pushes this  lost  film to a very high level indeed .  the written interview with the director on the  special features  section of the dvd is definitely worth reading if you have the time .   ,1
the director sidney j . furie has created in hollow point a post  modern absurdist masterpiece that challenges and constantly surprises the audience .  br    br   sidney j . furie dares to ask the question of what happens to the tired conventional traditionalist paradigms of  plot  and  characterisation  when you remove the crutches of  motivation  and  reason  .  br    br   the result leads me to say that my opinion of him could not possibly get any higher .  br    br   one and a half stars .  br    br   p . s . nothing in this movie makes any sense  the law enforcement agents are flat out unlikeable and the organised criminals are full on insane .  ,0
actually  the movie is neither horror nor sci  fi . with a very strong christian religious theme  this movie delivers minimal content and no suspense . second  tier actors do half  decent jobs of reading their boring roles . the only good performance is by sydney penny who plays a role of a mother of . . . i won  t spoil the movie  it  s either christ or anti  christ . avoid watching this movie unless you a christian religious fanatic obsessed with apocalypse .  br    br   being a non  christian  i had to force myself to watch this movie just because i wanted to write this review . it  s a pity that sci  fi channel had to air this movie at the peak evening time .  ,0
i sincerely hope that at least the first season of cosby is released on dvd someday . the episode with hilton  s eccentric genius brother  george  played by the late roscoe lee browne   is classic hilarity . it reflects the classic sibling rivalry and love between brothers whose lives took different paths but both ended up happy .  br    br   mr . cosby and ms . rashad brilliantly recaptured the chemistry that they shared on the cosby show for many years and to put them in a more middle  class role shows the dimensions they can take as artists .  br    br   the roster of comedic dynamite . . . madeline kahn  phylicia rashad  and mr . cosby . . . classic genius   ,1
this has to be one of the most outrageously stupid movies i have ever seen in my entire life . just when i think i have seen the stupidest scene in history  along comes an even dumber and more bizarre scene . i think the transvestite poodles did it for me  or better yet  her talking tongue . . . or perhaps the guy getting the virgin mother statue mounted to a jeep windshield caught in his throat . decisions  decisions . . .  ,0
there is absolutely nothing in this movie that shows even the tiniest scrap of talent . nobody in it has ever tried acting before  even the extras in the coffee shop look as if they  ve been glued in place . nothing looks rehearsed . the film quality is terrible . most of the  action  takes place in narrow corridors or apartments with the cameraman crammed in as an afterthought  swinging some cheapo camera backwards and forwards between  actors  as they deliver their lines . no tripod and no proper microphone either  there sound quality is terrible . even  manos  fares better than this  at least they had proper equipment . what plot there is simply gets lost in the production mess .  br    br   stick to home videos  preferably made by some  year kid trying out the video feature on daddy  s new camera phone . you will be in for a long search to find a movie more inept than this .  ,0
the scenes are fast  paced . the characters are great . i love anne  marie johnson  s acting . i really like the ending .  br    br   however  i was disappointed that this movie didn  t delve deeper into achilles  s and athena  s relationship . it only blossomed when they kissed each other .  ,1
as a child the first installment   the little mermaid   was my favorite movie . it was filled with great characters  songs  and a fun family film . a week or so again i watched this movie for the first time . i believe that this movie was like most sequels and didn  t surpass their original . i think that i feel this way possibly because i had high expectations and i have grown up . however  it is not a bad film .  br    br   it starts when ariel has just given birth to a beautiful child  melody . eric and ariel feel threatened by morgana  eurselas  sister   so they build a large wall around their house which lies on the sea . as melody grows up she begins to wonder outside of the walls where she is forbidden to go . trouble stirs up as morgana tries to take control of the seven seas .  br    br   i don  t want to give away any of the movie so you have to see it to find out . i did like that the voices are the same and again wonderful singing . i think this is a good family film though overall   ,0
first i liked that movie . it seemed to me a nice comedy with some silly moments . the costume designer albert wolsky did his best    the same as wonderful set decorator robert r . benton  this man really had a very good taste    but the script writers disappointed me extremely . the best ending would be the scene on the ladder  but instead of it  they decided that the father and his daughter should be together . don  t like the ending . the father becomes boyfriend of his own daughter and his ex  wife knows about it and finds it alright . it would be ok  if the scriptwriters would for example say that now there is a different soul in the body  but they did not  they only deprived him of memories . the actors were good  they were really funny . cybill shepherd was charming  robert downey jr . was very funny in the dancing scene     . . . but some of the moments spoil even the impression of good acting . for example  corinne jeffries  played by cybill shepherd after the death of her husband was waiting for him   years  it  s a long time    she was true to him  she loved nobody but him  and when she met him and was just about making love to him  after a scene with her friend philip train  ryan o  neal   she very easily betrayed the man she was longing for so many years    it would be a good movie  if not the ending and some missed human psychology .  ,0
revolution is a terrible movie  i don  t care if you  re a history teacher  news writer  al pacino fan  there  s no way this movie can possibly earn a legitimate     .  br    br   the key point to the plot is tom dobb  al  trying to get money from a note he got for radical patriots taking his boat . everything revolves around that note . tom  s son joins the army to make up for the note  making tom join the army as well  they go on an adventure trying to get out of the army  years later the war is over and they can finally turn in the note for their boat . the end .  br    br   it had a few battle scenes  and they were pretty mediocre at best . transistions between scenes used  five months later  and magically put the characters in some famous historical battle . the love story is a joke  and the movie as a whole is just hard to follow . so save your  notes  and watch the patriot instead .  ,0
i can not believe such slanted  jingoistic material is getting passed off to americans as art house material . early on  from such telling lines like  we want to make sure they are playing for the right team  and manipulative framing and lighting  a love divided shows it  s true face . the crass manner in which the irish catholics are shown as hegemonic  the protestants as peaceful and downtrodden  is as poor a representation of history as early us westerns that depict the struggle between cowboys and american indians . the truth of the story is distorted with the stereotypes and outright vilification of the irish catholics in the story a corruption admitted by the filmmakers themselves  it is sad that people today still think that they can win moral sway by making a film so easily recognized for it  s obvious intent  so far from attempting art . this film has no business being anywhere in any legitimate cinema or library .  ,0
four teenage girls in a suburb of los angeles get into all kinds of trouble parties  drugs  cops  mixed  up parents  older boyfriends . jodie foster  sort of the mother hen of the pack  tries keeping everyone together like  a family   like the family unit she  s never had   and the heartbreaking thing about the movie is that she can  t . slowly  everyone grows up and goes away . that precise plot point  though underscored throughout  is unfortunately tampered with . did we really need a long sequence with scott baio outracing a car full of thugs on his skateboard  or an even longer sequence   also with baio   where foster has a strange soliloquy about the  pain of illusion  . some of the dialogue in fact is downright loopy  and i didn  t much care for an edit late in the film that segues clumsily from a death to a wedding . but these are nitpicks in what is basically a very sensitive story about the loss of a tight bond . and jodie  s face at the ending speaks volumes . if viewers do get choked up at the end  the movie has earned this . it doesn  t pander for tears or ask for sympathy . it shows us an example of friendship and hopes we understand .  from   ,1
a very slick modern  keeping it sensually hip  revamp on the dracula story  although staying with the traditional customs  with quite an interesting  if not fully grasped back story of the prince of darkness . the first time i tried watching it i could only make it halfway through  before losing interest . again it gets off to a good start  especially the scenes with the thieves and then their encounters with dracula   but then for me it got less involving when it hits new orleans to focus on van helsing  s daughter . a great place to set it  but never took advantage of its settings  despite etching a paradise in damn  where dracula could flourish  . produced by wes carven  and yeah they throw that name out there   but written  directed by patrick lussier . artistically it had its moments with few dreamlike visuals  but some kinetic editing and cheap jolts don  t help . the messy script does get considerably silly . lussier does a polished job that remains rather glassy  inserting a lot of blood  the make  up is suitably achieved  and a lot of  virgin  advertising . no i don  t mean virgins  it  s the music company  as it does get in numerous shots and helsing  s daughter works there too . oh that wasn  t obvious planting . the soundtrack is an amusing choice of rock tunes . now the performances are all over the shop  but there are few familiar faces to spot  danny masterson  sean patrick thomas  nathan fillion  shane west and lochlyn munro  . gerard butler as dracula just didn  t come off  as not much of a presence was formed . he was simply out  shined by the succulent ladies of the night jennifer esposito  colleen fitzpatrick and jeri ryan as dracula  s brides . the likes of jonny lee millar and justine waddell are respectably okay . christopher plummer gives out a grizzled turn as van helsing and omar epps has fun with his role .  ,0
the producers made a big mistake casting mark lester  who couldn  t act or sing  in the title role . aside from his very bad  acting   all of lester  s singing had to be dubbed by a girl . i don  t know why they cast him at all  since there would have been so many boys who could have played the part infinitely better and done their own singing as well . shani wallis was far too old to play nancy  who was only supposed to be   . the current west end version is so much better than the movie in every way . ross mccormack is the best artful dodger of all time and he is certainly far better looking than jack wild ever was . it was clearly political to award this old  fashioned musical so many oscars after the tumultuous events of     .  ,0
this is the least scary film i have ever seen . how the blob manages to eat anyone is the biggest mystery of the film . the blob moves so slowly that an o . a . p in a zimmerframe could escape it . the blob has a large slice of luck coming across a typical horror film woman who instead of running away stands still for half an hour so that she can be eaten . if you havent seen this film i recommend you do  its far too funny to be taken seriously .  ,0
i liked this movie i remember there was one very well done scene in this movie where riff randell  played by p . j . soles  is lying in her bed smoking pot and then she begins to visualize that the ramones are in the room with her sing the song  i want you around  . . . very very cool stuff .  br    br   it was fun  energetic  quirky and cool . yes i  ll admit that the ending is way  way over the top and far fetched . . . but it doesn  t matter because it is fun this is a very fun movie . it  s sex  pot and rock n rocll forever  br    br   i read that cheap trick was the band who was originally to star in this . . but i do not know if this is true or not  ,1
since my third or fourth viewing some time ago  i  ve abstained from la maman et la putain while i wait for the dvd . in the meantime  i  ve read the french screenplay as well as alain philippon  s monograph on jean eustache . the latter ends with a frustrating filmography  eleven films  fiction  doc  and in  between  impossible to see or  in the cases of mes petites amoureuses and le pre nol . . .  re  see .  br    br   a few questions that hit me this moment polish vronika  s french is plenty colloquial  un maximum d   un maximum d    . even so  does she have an accent  i think i can tell she does . what does the absence of color add  especially at the single spot the fringe of the city is glimpsed  how does this fringe differ from the sleep and journey that separates worlds of the tempest and the winter  s tale  ditto alphaville . we may imagine the elapsed years since have done it  but does eustache deliberately circumscribe the film  s milieu  is this an enchanted isle  is alexandre  s a fairy tale  alexandre  s always choreographing himself  worrying about how or where to stand or walk  what to say when  announcing these decisions to who have to care less than he does what he does . or is this his way of trying to choreograph others by doing it to himself  how different is he from vertigo  s scottie   i say  i think  very .  what  s the difference  and is there one  between eustache  s laud  and truffaut  s  and godard  s  how different is the present laud  isn  t he still doing it  whatever it is  in recent roles  irma vep  le pornographe  whatever  approaching old age  once i arrived early for one in a series of mostly antoine doinel  laud  s character  truffaut films . for a long while  every three or five minutes  down the aisle would come a twenty  something male in scarf  tweedy coat  laud hair  with a direction  seeking nose . i have no idea whether this was conscious or unconscious mimicry . i was that age  but have no idea what i myself looked like then . no scarf  at least . i do have a brother  though  who seems to have learned his carriage from bresson .  ,1
sure  we all like bad movies at one time or another  and we in fact enjoy them  this however  wasn  t even a guilty pleasure  it was just crap . some guy  vince offer  who is conceited enough to make himself the main character while probably got drunk  high   probably both   and thought it was a great idea to make a movie . he then proceeded to show his script to equally high  drunk individuals . overall  this movie was so bad  predictable  and unoriginal i couldn  t get through   minutes of it before i turned it off . it makes you got served look like citizen kane . bat man  wtf . . . some guy that walks around with a bat  real original . almost as good as calling him fat man  and having a fat guy walk around in a superhero outfit .  ,0
perhaps the most personal of david lynch  s works is his most accessible . this time  rather than the enigmatic thematic structures that may or may not involve a plot or represent anything more than vivid nightmares  lynch provides a reflective  fragile meditation on the universal subjects of aging and family and finds reassurance in both . the simple true story of an iowa farmer  richard farnsworth  who rides a lawn mower to wisconsin to visit his estranged  stricken brother  there are still plenty of the unique and original visual dreamscapes  some rather striking aerial shots of the heartland  filmed by veteran cinematographer freddy francis  to make it an undeniable lynch effort and characterizations that are some of his most unforgettable . farnsworth is excellent in a stoic yet personable way  allowing the stories he hears on his journey to become a part of his life  and sissy spacek turns in some of her finest work in a smaller role as his mentally challenged yet observant daughter  whose painful secret is revealed in a poignant way through a gentle turn in the sensitive script by john roach and mary sweeney  but the rest of the small cast to a person delivers indelible performances  one of the most notable being barbara robertson  whose accidental killing of a deer is both uproarious and sad at the same time . but that  s vintage lynch with his ability to engage and unsettle you at his best . to those unfamiliar with lynch or know him only by his violent  disturbing reputation  this is an excellent place to begin for those who know his work  this is one of the finest in his repertoire .  ,1
this peabody award winning episode is one of the highlights of the  st season where a holodeck malfunction traps captain picard  beverly  data  and a starfleet historian named waylan within a      s san francisco setting . this episode is an homage to raymond chandler  s  maltese falcon  where patrick stewart assumes the humphrey bogart role  complete with fedora and trenchcoat . the office itself is almost an exact replica of the one featured in bogey  s  maltese falcon .   br    br   this episode also briefly introduces us to a mysterious insect race called the jarada that communicate with mostly a high  pitched buzzing sound . communication with this alien race is difficult  and it is up to picard to communicate with this race in their native tongue so that negotiations and diplomacy can finally begin . the best part of this episode  though  is the appearance of the famous hollywood b  actor lawrence tierney in the role of the gangster cyrus redblock . he was such a handsome man back in the      s . oh  well . . .  ,1
i would not have known about this film if not for its  surprise  oscar nomination for best animated feature film . thankfully  it came to pass that i was able to watch this animated little treasure .  br    br   the story is about the child brendan who was the nephew of the imposing and overprotective abbot of the township of kells . the main pre  occupation of the abbot is to build a wall to protect kells from the attacking vikings . one day  aiden  the renowned illustrator from iona  sought refuge with them . aiden opens brendan  s eyes to the art of illustration and the lure of the outside world . along the way  brendan befriended the white forest sprite aisling  as he sought to recover an ancient crystal invaluable to the meticulous art of book illustration .  br    br    the secret of kells  is unlike most of the animation released these days . it is a throwback of sorts as the illustrations are done in stark geometric lines and design without much care for realism  as much as symbolism . the movements of these lines are reminiscent of the simplistic yet fluid animation style used at the beginning sequence of  kung fu panda .  however  it is the magnificent use of color that is the main source of wonderment for the audience . the reds used in the viking invasion sequence is unforgettably haunting .  br    br   try to catch this quiet gem of a film . it is a welcome respite from all the senseless bombast of current animated fare such as  monsters vs . aliens  and the like . the sparse celtic musical score is effective in evoking the sense of fantasy that imbues the film . ok  the story might be a little shallow and the ending a bit wanting . i would have liked to know more about the book that brendan and aiden was working on . but the clear star of this film is clearly its amazing stylized artwork  said to be based on the artwork in the real book of kells .  ,1
i first saw this when i was around  . i remembered what i believed to be a vague outline of what took place . turns out now    years later  that i remembered everything with great accuracy because it seems the writers never got beyond making an outline to the story . there is no plot to this movie  cartoon . there is no character development  no back story  no character arcs  nothing . the good guys do things because they are good  while the bad guys do things solely because they are bad . one unintentionally hilarious part is when someone who you would think to be important dies and nobody cares in the least . they just shrug their shoulders and move on . there  s barely any dialogue either . if you cut out the fight scenes and the running scenes  you lose    of the movie .  br    br   watch this because you want to see some good animation and for no other reason . or if you like to look at scantily clad hot cartoon chicks  or scantily clad hot cartoon dudes  .  ,0
everybody knows that gregory widen  s original  the prophecy  didn  t really require a sequel  but you also don  t need a degree in rocket science hanging above your chimney to realize that further cash  ins on this profitable horror concept were inevitable . part two is a very prototypic example of a straight  to  video sequel  meaning the creative and convoluted plot of the original has been simplified a lot in favor of more action  more witty one  liners and a lot more eerie religious scenery . the only good news is that the producers managed to keep christopher walken for the role of gabriel  and he delivers another gloriously brazen performance that promptly justifies the price of a rental . if it wasn  t for walken  s performance  and perhaps a couple of players in the supportive cast like brittany murphy and glenn danzig    the prophecy ii  surely would have disappeared into oblivion straight after its release . the movie begins with gabriel literally getting spat out of hell to proceed with his ongoing war of heaven here on earth . the purpose of his battle this time is to prevent the baby of nurse valerie rosales  jennifer beals  from getting born . for you see  her unborn child is the first ever hybrid between a heavenly angel and an earthly  monkey  and the birth of such a superior being would imply the downfall of gabriel  s evil dominion . thus  just as in the first movie  he engages a suicidal accomplice to assist him and hunts valerie all the way down to the eden for the final showdown .  the prophecy ii  is an endurable and occasionally even entertaining movie as long as you don  t make comparisons with the original and as long as you manage to overlook the multiple plot holes and errors in continuity . whenever the storyline becomes too tedious  the makers luckily enough always insert a near  brilliant christopher walken moment to distract you . his interactions with the rebellious izzy and particularly his ignorance regarding modern earthly technologies often result in worthwhile and memorable sequences . on a slightly off  topic note  i often felt like  the prophecy ii  ambitions to look similar to  terminator ii   gabriel  s resurrection looked somewhat like the teleportation of a futuristic cyborg and the eden location  where the final battle takes place  looks very similar to the steel factory where  terminator ii  ended as well . coincidence  i guess  overall  this is an inferior and passable sequel but still worth checking out in case you  re a fan of christopher walken  s unique acting charisma  and who isn  t   .  ,0
while filming an    s horror movie called  hot blooded   the director is brutally murdered and the leading lady is scarred as she survives the attack and manages to kill murderer . after all of this  the production is abandoned and the stock reels are left to gather dust . so a group of filmmakers decide to pick up where the film left off even though they  re warned by people to keep away from the film  as the last person who was interested in the flick turned up dead in the cinema while watching the film . from this it  s labelled as a cursed production . not taking these warnings seriously the crew goes ahead with the production and they get the original star of the movie to return from hollywood to reprise her role  but not as the daughter but the mother . but again the murders start occurring with the cast and crew getting butchered by an unknown figure dressed up as the film  s killer .  br    br   look what  scream  started  hey  i enjoy those films  but mostly everything else that followed on afterwards were annoying and pointless excuses . during this stage the sub  genre came back with vengeance  but it wasn  t much of a good thing as they were mostly unsuccessful and unoriginal attempts  where they followed the derivative pattern of the scream franchise .  cut  which is an independent australian take on the textbook slasher genre is purely shonky garbage that lacks basically everything and shamelessly knocks off every other slasher flick . but you know what  i found it a cheesy delight . yeah  it  s gawd awful and highly forgettable  but it  s a bit of ala good cheap fun while it lasted . although i did hate it when i originally came across it  but the second time around i knew what i was getting myself into and it worked better for it . it was just like helping myself to a nice slice cheesecake again  but this time it wasn  t so sweet .  br    br   the film came out around the same time as  scream   and  urban legends the final cut  did  which all three follow the same structure of using a movie within a movie .  scream   is obviously the strongest of the three  but i would actually watch this trash over urban legends the final cut . though  it did seem more of a throwback to the    s slashers than that of one of scream  s bastard offspring . pretty much the film is given b  grade treatment and that shows up in the script and performances . the dialog is truly unimaginative and hardly comes up with any surprises and suspense . while  the performances are pure mockery and molly ringwald takes the crown for it . she plays the wash  up actress returning to finish the cursed flick and i had good fun with her laughably ridiculous send  up performance . she provides the bite here and nails it down perfectly . the rest were mostly recognizable australian tv stars  that  s if you  re an australian  with a ravishing jessica napier leading the cast with the likes of stephen curry and frank roberts . also pop singer  and supposed actress  kylie minogue makes a cameo appearance in the opening just to be hacked up  nice . these teens mostly followed the formula of horny and dim  witted kids that have nothing better to do but to be killed . sometimes it feels like they just waiting in queue  because they have no real substance to be there .  br    br   the plot starts off rather interestingly  then heads into a mystery phase where red herrings pop up  but then it makes a sudden u  turn where it becomes a somewhat satire on the horror genre . simply it  s rather choppy and when it comes to the explanation for all of this madness i was kind of left thinking oh my . this when it tries to twist back onto itself in a clever manner  but sadly it falls along way . but don  t you just love an opening ending . also it sports some pop culture references and a self referential  tongue  in  cheek approach . predictability makes its way in rather early and the jokes can become over  stated at times  but it knows that by poking fun at itself quite a bit . the atmosphere looses a bit of edge because of the humour taking away the bleakness  but still the isolated grand old mansion where they are filming has some neat touches that added  some  spookiness . the cinema scene is done rather nicely too .  br    br   now  now we know we want gore and nudity when watching this type of flick  but sadly there  s no nudity to be found and the gore is pretty standard  if lacking but it  s more then decent for such low  budget flick . there are one or two creative deaths  but the rest are systematic . the killer wasn  t bad but when he spoke it kind of hurt it i thought  well the smart  ass attitude didn  t sit well with me . another notes of the production which were dire ranged from the cut  away editing  out  of  place soundtrack and kimble rendall  s direction lacked execution and was pretty careless  but these contributing factors pull together to add some sort of sheer entertainment to all of this badness .  br    br   the imagination matches the budget that  s for sure  but heck this lousy slasher wasn  t trying to be anything else . pure schlock that  s slightly amusing   ,0
saw it yesterday night at the midnight slam of the festival des films du monde in montreal . what a disappointment . this movie is clearly over rated by imdb fans . the acting was only but regular . the directing didn  t bring anything new or interesting . the plot lacks considerably  the movie is all about those college grads and the game they play making prank calls   eventy  ive  . and on top of that  you can predict the movie  s end in the first five minutes . if you like prank calls and a slasher with an axe that makes you jump only once or twice during the whole movie  you might like it . if you don  t  this movie is not worth it .  ,0

you already know how painful to watch this movie is . but i wonder why one of the worst movies ever should include one the most beautiful cars . why the cars should be not only the victim of violation  but also the only true actors and performers in it . so how on earth you porsche  lamborghini or whatever could allow those people to get in touch with your cars and ruin you reputation for which you give millions . stop the getting an advantage of the cars and earn money on their chests . it is painful for those who love cars . it is painful for those who love movies .  br    br   i want my money back     ,0
those of the  instant gratification  era of horror films will no doubt complain about this film  s pace and lack of gratuitous effects and body count . the fact is   the empty acre  is a good a example of how independent horror films should be done .  br    br   if you avoid the indie racks because you are tired of annoying teens or twenty somethings getting killed by some baddie whose back  story could have come off the back of a count chocula box   the empty acre  is the movie for you .  br    br   set in the decaying remnants of the rural american dream   the empty acre  is the tale of a young couple struggling with the disappearance of their six  month  old baby . as the couple  s weak relationship falls apart  a larger story plays out in the background . at night  a shapeless dark mass seethes from a sun baked barren acre on their farm and seemingly devours anything in its path  leaving no sign that it was ever there .  br    br   the film is loaded with enigmatic characters and visual clues as to what is happening  and ends with a well executed ending that resonates with just enough left over questions to validate the writer  director  s faith in an intellectual audience .  br    br   there seems to be a sub  text concerning the death of the american dream  but i would hardly call the film an allegory . riveting  well acted  and technically astute   the empty acre  is a fantastic little indie that thinking horror fans should love .  ,1
when i saw birthday girl i liked it so much i set out to see every nicole kidman film i could  only to find all of them a disappointment compared to it . i theorize that while the presence of a particular star usually guarantees a certain level of quality because of their artistic control  with nicole kidman the influence she exerts is detrimental to film enjoyment   imho . thus for instance  dogville  even depriving the viewer of anything visual to detract from the existential insight she is hammering home  or other films promoting gay and lesbianism as worthy of anyone else  s attention  or other pet causes of kidman  s .  br    br   here she is a natural woman and she does a really great job . i don  t how or who was able to restrain her  but apparently it worked . the way the film depicts her openness despite her resistance gets to the heart of what makes a woman a woman . and consequently  what makes a man  s most desperate hopes marginally attainable .  br    br   of course  the fact the male lead transforms from a milquetoast clerk to macho man in the space of one film sounds like a male ego expansion fantasy  but his transformation is adequately believable . it isn  t coyly contrived as it would be in a film engineered to bolster male ego . instead it accurately records necessary growth arising from the films unique circumstances .  br    br   also quite charming is the way the criminals are portrayed as perfectly human  apart from their criminal mission . her gang has a coed rough and tumble fellowship which is foreign to american culture . and while they are his adversaries  they are never really his enemy . in effect  they teach him to be compete .  br    br   i really marveled at kidman  s ability to physically appear russian . it had me wondering whether her ancestry was russian  but none of the photos of her i examined showed any hint of it . maybe it is just makeup but it was amazing .  br    br   i can only hope that they knock her over the head again soon so she can turn out another great film . despite my gratuitous digs at ms . kidman  the message is this is a superior film in every way and probably the role of a lifetime .  ,1
doc savage the man of bronze is a horrible movie . poorly scripted  over  acted  and just plain silly . that being said . . . it is actually an enjoyable movie on some level . this movie begs to be watched in a group with an ample supply of cheap beer . it  s one of those movies like  santa claus conquers the martians  or  yor  the hunter from the future  . . . so bad it is almost good . if you have the right group of people this movie is a blast to watch . it  s campy . it  s fun . it has a theme by sousa . if you  re looking for a good movie though  look elsewhere .     .  br    br   btw  i  ve heard rumors some studio is exploring the possibility of a remake . . .  ,0
made only ten years after the actual events  and set in the bunker under the reichstag  pabst  s film is wholly gripping . it reeks of sulfurous death awaiting the perpetrators of world war . haven  t seen this in over three decades  but it remains strong in my visual and emotional memory . the characters seem to be waiting to be walled up in their cave . searing bit of dialog between two generals  does god exist    if he did  we wouldn  t .  shame this is not more readily available for exhibition or purchase because it would be interesting to view and compare this film with the documentary about traudl junge   im toten winkel  aka  blind spot hitler  s secretary   and  downfall  with bruno ganz .  ,1
this film has an interesting plot  but the acting is quite bad and the script is poor . i was very disappointed . the moral dilemma faced by the main character is an intriguing one  but due to poor writing and casting this potentially winning premise is plundered .  of the  other people in the theater left after about   minutes and the other  were laughing at how bad the film was . i stuck it out to the end  but i must admit i played blackjack on my cell phone to make the last   minutes bearable .  ,0
i have been an environmentalist for years and was really looking forward to this show . i had it set to record all episodes because i thought i could really learn some great new things . i probably could if i could get past rachelle .  br    br   i  m sure a lot of this is staged to seem like a reality show and appeal to that class of viewer . it doesn  t work for someone who  s really interested in improving the planet .  br    br   this show should be called nagging with rachelle .  br    br   since ed is such a great font of information  maybe a second show that  s really serious about the environment would be a good idea . dumbing things down is not necessary for some of us .  br    br   i no longer record episodes or watch the show  but do let me know if a real green show may be in the works .  ,0
one of the most disgusting films i have ever seen . i wanted to vomit after watching it . i saw this movie in my american history class and the purpose was to see an incite on the life of a farmer in the west during the late      s . what we saw were pigs being shot and then slaughtered  human birth  branding . oh and at the end there was a live birth of a calf and let me tell you that the birth itself wasn  t too bad  but the numerous fluids that came out drove most people in my class to the bathroom . the story itself was ok . the premise of the story is a widow and her daughter and they move to the west to be a house keeper of this cowboy . they live a life of hardship and it is an interesting a pretty accurate view of life in the west during the late      s . but if you have a choice  do not see this movie .  ,0
higher and higher was one of rodgershart  s lesser broadway musicals it only had a run of   performances on broadway in     . yet it yielded one of their bigger hits it never entered my mind .  br    br   nevertheless except for one minor song  so disgustingly rich  the entire broadway score was scrapped when rko bought the film rights . instead a whole new score by jimmy mchugh and harold adamson was written  mostly to accommodate one francis albert sinatra who was making his feature film debut .  br    br   sinatra who had done some vocal cameos in previous films  takes a leaf from the page of his singing rival bing crosby . when bing did his feature film debut in the big broadcast  he played bing crosby . frank sinatra took on the role of frank sinatra and i can  t think of anyone who could have done a better job .  br    br   the chairman of the board is billed third here behind stars jack haley and michele morgan . he  s the butler and she  s the scullery maid to leon errol . in fact errol is a millionaire who hasn  t paid his help for seven months . mainly because he  s about to go belly up into chapter   or so he informs the staff .  br    br   errol  s a delightful old soul to work for and none of the staff want to lose a good thing . they pool their resources and get michele morgan to impersonate errol  s daughter who  s over in switzerland with her mother . the idea being to snag a rich bankroll in the hopes rescuing the family fortune . only michele starts looking at another .  br    br   it  s a slight plot and certainly no worse than a whole lot of musicals  but rko invested this film with a good cast of players . barbara hale and elizabeth risdon play another dbutante and her mother who suspect something  s not right  victor borge is a fortune seeking no account  dooley wilson  paul hartman  grace hartman  marcy mcguire  mel torme and mary wickes  play others of the errol household staff . not a bad bunch at all .  br    br   sinatra sang three good ballads all of them had some kind of commercial success  the music stopped  a lovely way to spend an evening  and i couldn  t sleep a wink last night . the last one was nominated for an oscar for best song  but lost to alice faye  s you  ll never know .  br    br       was the year of the musician  s union strike against the recording industry . to get their material out  frank sinatra recorded the songs from higher and higher with an acapella chorus for columbia . bing crosby recorded songs from his film dixie in the same manner for decca . both of them were denounced by the president of the union  james c . petrillo as strikebreakers and both did not cross the picket line again . the strike wasn  t settle completely until     although decca broke ranks earlier from the other record companies and settled earlier than columbia  rca victor and the others .  br    br   the strike provided some anxious moments for sinatra . he had just left the tommy dorsey orchestra when the strike was called . it closed off a needed venue for his artistry when he wasn  t sure whether leaving dorsey would prove to be a right career move .  br    br   fortunately higher and higher was received well a legend was launched .  ,1
titanic is a classic . i was really surprised that this movie didn  t have a solid ten  overall in the imdb user rankings . maybe  it  s just cool to not give titanic credit nowadays  but when it was first made it was really something . when the movie came out people flocked to the theaters . when it came out on video my sister and i would watch it twice a day for a month . it was safe to say we were obsessed and for good reason . some of the disaster scenes were hard to forgot  like the frozen baby  or the guy who committed suicide after killing someone in the unruly crowd . many people died on that ship  and to convey that on film with the immediacy and emotion it needed is a hard challenge that james cameron stepped up to . and let  s not forget the amazing romance between jack and rose . whether or not their relationship was a figment of someone  s imagination it was lovely . they barely knew each other  but they would die for each other . they trusted each other . they sure as hell are giving romeo and juliet a run for their money .  i  ll never let go  jack .  titanic is a great film down to it  s very core . it is a powerful story told through brilliant acting  excellent cinematography  beautiful music  and a crew full of hard and dedicated workers . it really blows my mind when someone says they hate this movie .  ,1
admittedly  parsifal is not an opera that can appeal to everyone  although it is a favourite of mine  knappertsbusch       in particular . syberberg  s entire approach is so static . whenever the music suddenly begins to swell . . . syberberg keeps the cast moving at the same pace . the takes on amfortas and klingsor are endless . whatever happened to film editing  the result is physically exhausting to watch . the viewer is never spiritually transported . your impulse is to rush home and play a recording again to confirm that wagner got it right  syberberg got it wrong . and that set decoration with those  clever  reminders of wagner  s anti  semitism   will there ever be a viewer of this film with no prior knowledge of wagner   ,0
sam  thomas cavanagh  and gray  heather graham  are devoted siblings who share an apartment and a love of many things   ballroom dancing      s movie musicals and  much to their surprise  an attractive woman named charlie  bridget moynahan  . historically heterosexual  gray is confused by her new feelings .  br    br   gray matters proves to be one of the blandest films i have ever seen . it  s dull  predictable  unfunny  poorly acted and poorly written . nothing about it felt real and everything was very cheesy . also  this isn  t really a romantic comedy with a special twist but more of a  coming out  movie . sue kramer tried to make the first half cute with the romantic stuff and the second half serious with the actual acceptance and coming out part . unfortunately  she failed miserably . the first half was largely unfunny and only heather graham was able to hold it up a little . then  the film took an awkward tone and got all serious . the serious scenes were handled poorly and all of the emotions just felt phony .  br    br   i guess i would have enjoyed the film a little more if the relationships between the characters felt more authentic . the brother and sister relationship was very weak and they didn  t really appear to be that close . their relationship just didn  t feel very natural . also  the relationship between tom and bridget felt very unnatural . if two people are going to get married after only knowing each other for less than a week  then you would expect to see a little more excitement but the characters talked about getting married in vegas in the same manner of asking a waiter what the specials are . there was a lack of excitement in the film and it was hard to get involved with the movie with such unmotivated characters .  br    br   the acting was mostly weak which was a bit surprising given the decent cast . heather graham gave the only good performance in the movie . she was funny and had a few charming scenes but it  s too bad that all of her co  stars were complete duds . bridget moynahan was very weak and her performance ringed false on every level . also  it seemed like she was reading her lines . thomas cavanagh was pretty wooden and he showed nearly no emotion . the chemistry between thomas and heather was non existent and that damaged the film because their relationship felt phony . i can usually rely on molly shannon to be funny in a supporting role but here she was just annoying . sissy spacek had about two scenes and she was annoying in both of them . finally  alan cumming just had an embarrassing character and his performance wasn  t very good . overall  gray matters is a lame film and it isn  t worth watching . rating      ,0
  i just viewed this movie last night and i don  t think i will ever think the same about any of the actors involved  because this movie will stick in the back of my mind .   br    br   the above statement can be thought of as a good or a bad thing . i mean every time i see tom cruise or demi moore in a movie  i think of  a few good men  which is a good thing . now  every time i see ron perlman or kristy swanson  i will think of  tinseltown  which is a very bad thing .  br    br   i picked this up thinking that it might be something intelligent or at least make me chuckle and with arye gross and the aforementioned swanson and perlman  i thought that it at least wouldn  t be bad . you could tell the movie was made on a budget the size of wheeling  indiana  where  exactly .   but maybe they used every dollar to make a good movie . wrong .  br    br   this movie is not funny or entertaining in any sense of either word . it is just there and lasts for   excruciating slow minutes .  br    br   the characters are paper  thin . you almost care about none of the characters  and since the leads are two struggling hollywood writers with a dream that is all the two struggling writers with a dream who wrote this need you to know about them . okay  the two real writers know all about there onscreen versions of themselves  so they figure so does the audience . they don  t even think about character development  except for trying to tie there story back to  gilligan  s island  .  br    br   the plot is unoriginal . two guys live in a storage center  where one of them stores a bed  and there are about twenty other people living there  too . the rest of the story is contrived and stupid . have you seen  national lampoon  s favorite deadly sins   the second story with joe mantegna is about a television writer who can  t find a good story to make a tv movie about  so he creates one . now substitute the television writer for a screenwriter  morph mantegna into to annoying actors half his age  and take away the comedy and you have this movie .  br    br   the actors try . kristy swanson is in the movie for maybe   minutes and still gives the best performance in the movie . she is still hot  but it would help if she would actually star in a movie instead of constantly making cameos . as for everyone else  i don  t think it was the actors fault because they have bad material  br    br   go watch the national lampoon  s movie  but stay away from this movie .  ,0
after a quasi  gothic  all  fruity music video  the movie starts with cassidy the lead singer killing herself . in a perfect world that would be that and the end credits would roll . we don  t live n that world . the insipid band members decide to go to some clown to contact her dead essence . when i say clown  i mean actual clown . he tell them they  re all going to die via cassidy  s ghost  the spirit possesses dora  one of the band  mates  we couldn  t care less as the characters are all boring  vapid  and extremely horribly acted . written by adam hackbarth  an incredibly apropos surname if there ever was one   and directed by corbin timbrook  who after the attendant  and tower of blood  has to know that he keeps making crap for a living   this movie s a constant battle between the film  s incompetence and the viewer  s need to stay awake . not enough blood to appease gore  hounds  nor enough nudity to satisfy pervs . this movie in fact has absolutely nothing to recommend to absolutely anyone .  br    br   my grade f  br    br   eye candy amanda carraway gets topless  br    br   where i saw it starz on demand  ,0
dudley moore is fantastic in this largley unknown classic . this film is very witty film that relies hugely on the actors talent . without dudley moore  john gielgud  liza minnelli  and a few others  this film could have been a disaster . it is not always well shot and at times has some very corny music that tries to force a mood  the  psycho   like music at the wedding fight   but the acting overcomes it . the character arthur is hilarious  with his drunken comments . but he develops well into a more mature  well rounded character as he learns to live by his own free will . the end is fairly corny  though . i wont give it away  but it could be improved . worth seeing many times .  ,1
on the surface  this movie would appear to deal with the psychological process called individuation  that is how to become a true self by embracing the so  called  dark  side of human nature . thus  we have the darkling  a classic shadowy devilish creature desperately seeking the company  that is  recognition  of men  and the story revolves around the various ways in which this need is handled  more or less successfully .  br    br   however  if we dig a little deeper  we find that what this movie is actually about is how you should relate to your car like you would to any other person  in the opening scene  the main character  male car mechanic fallen from grace  is collecting bits and pieces from car wrecks with his daughter  when a car wreck nearly smashes the little girl . lesson    cars are persons embodied with immortal souls  and stealing from car wrecks is identical with grave robbery . the wicked have disturbed the dead and must be punished .  just after that  another character  rubin  buys a car wreck intending to repair it and sell it as a once  lost  now  found famous race  car and is warned by the salesman . lesson    just like any other person  a car has a unique identity that cannot be altered nor replaced . in addition  there is the twist that rubin actually sees a hidden quality in what most people would just think of as junk  but eventually that quality turns out to be a projection of rubin  s own personal greed for more profit . lesson    thou shalt never treat thy car as a means only  but always as an end in itself .  then we have the scene where the main character is introduced to rubin and  more importantly  rubin  s car the main character  s assessment of the car  s qualities is not just based on its outer appearance  but also by a thorough look inside the engine room . lesson    a car is not just to be judged by its looks  it is what is inside that really counts . there is punishment in store for those who do not keep this lesson in mind  as we see in the scene where another man tries to sell rubin a fake collector  s car . this scene by the way also underlines the importance of lesson   .  br    br   there are numerous other examples in the movie of the  carperson   theme  and i am too tired now to bother citing all of them  but the point remains  and i guess this is what i  m really trying to say  that this movie is fun to watch if you have absolutely nothing else to do  or  if you  re a car devotee .  ,0
what to say about this movie . well it is about a bunch of good students who have some bad drugs and turn into delinquent students that sell more of the bad drugs to people . two of those people have adverse effects as one turns into a toxic avenger type and his girlfriend throws up some creature that grows in the school  s basement . that is about all there is to it and they stretch it out for   minutes . this movie is pretty bad and should be locked away forever . though that is not fair  some people like troma  s movies and they can watch it if they want . troma movies for me though  are the worst movies there are out there . i just watched this one out of morbid curiosity .  ,0
halloween is not only the godfather of all slasher movies but the greatest horror movie ever  john carpenter and debra hill created the most suspenseful  creepy  and terrifying movie of all time with this classic chiller . michael myers is such a phenomenal monster in this movie that he inspired scores of imitators  such as jason vorhees  friday the   th   the miner  my bloody valentine   and charlie puckett  the night brings charlie  . okay  so i got a little obscure there  but it just goes to show you the impact that this movie had on the entire horror genre . no longer did a monster have to come from king tut  s tomb or from dr . frankenstein  s lab . he could be created in the cozy little neighborhoods of suburbia . and on the night he came home . . . haddonfield  illinois and the viewers would never be the same . there are many aspects of this movie that make it the crowning jewel of horror movies . first is the setting . . . it takes place in what appears to be a normal suburban neighborhood . many of us who grew up in an area such as this can easily identify with the characters . this is the type of neighborhood where you feel safe  but if trouble starts to brew  nobody wants to lift a finger to get involved  especially when a heavy  breathing madman is trying to skewer our young heroine .  along with the setting  the movie takes place on halloween   the scariest night of the year  while most people are carving jack  o  lanterns  michael myers is looking to carve up some teenie  boppers . besides the setting  there is some great acting . jamie lee curtis does a serviceable job as our heroine  laurie strode  a goody  two  shoes high  schooler who can never seem to find a date . however  it is donald pleasance  as dr . sam loomis  who really steals the show . his portrayal of the good doctor  who knows just what type of evil hides behind the black eyes of michael myers and feels compelled to send him to hell once and for all  is the stuff of horror legend . however  it is the synthesizer score that really drives this picture as it seems to almost put the viewer into the film . once you hear it  you will never forget it . i also enjoy the grainy feel to this picture . nowadays  they seem to sharpen up the image of every movie  giving us every possible detail of the monster we are supposed to be afraid of . in halloween  john carpenter never really lets us get a complete look at michael myers . he always seems like he is a part of the shadows  and  i think that is what makes him so terrifying . there are many scenes where michael is partly visible as he spies on the young teens  unbeknownst to them   which adds to his creepiness . if you think about  some wacko could be watching you right now and you wouldn  t even know it . unfortunately for our teenagers  and fortunately for us horror fans   when they find michael  he  s not looking for candy on this halloween night . . he  s looking for blood . finally  michael myers  himself  is a key element to this movie  s effectiveness . his relentless pursuit of laurie strode makes him seem like the killer who will never stop . he is the bogeyman that will haunt you for the rest of your life . so  if you have not seen this movie  if there are still some of you out there who haven  t  or even if you have   grab some popcorn  turn off every light  pop this into the old dvd and watch in fright . trick or treat   ,1
this is sad this movie is the tops this should at least be in the top    movies here . this is still the best action movie ever done . the action movies of today are badly done the actors and action directors do not no how to do it fighting and stunts properly . only some no how to do it mostly from hong kong like jackie chan . the stunts are so clever and wild i do not think we will see the likes of ever . the start where chan and his team go down the hill car chase through the hill town is just amazing . the end fight stunts are for me the best fight stunts ever put to film . the end stunt sliding down the pole crashing through the glass jackie was badly hurt .  ,1
this is a truly awful film . what they have done is taken a tv show  which was never aimed at young children  given it the george lucas treatment  i . e . ruined it by kiddifying it to appeal to the younger audience  .  br    br   ok so the thunderbirds tv show wasn  t exactly the most cerebral of shows  in fact it was pretty formulaic  but it was always enjoyable to watch  especially when the models got blown up  and the voice cast wasn  t too bad .  br    br   this suffers from bad casting  bad acting  with the notable exceptions of sophia myles as lady penelope  ron cook as parker  who seem to be the only cast members to have a clue about how their characters should be played   after this travesty i wouldn  t let frakes direct traffic .  br    br   the whole point of thunderbirds was that it was about the whole tracy family  how they worked as a team  preventing disasters or coming to the rescue of those involved in disasters .  br    br   avoid this rubbish like the plague .  br    br   i only give it  out of   because a zero rating is not supported .  ,0
sakura killers    outta  stars  maybe in     this movie might have seemed cool . . . if you had never ever seen a good ninja movie . cheesy    s music . . . cheesy dialogue . . . cheesy acting . . . and way  beyond  cheesy martial arts sequences . the coolest scene is at the beginning . . . with an aged chuck connors playing golf on a beach . . . several black clad ninjas try to sneak up on him and it looks like he is too intent on hitting his ball to notice . . . suddenly he reaches into his golf bag and . . . naw  i won  t spoil it for you . . . if you ever have the misfortune of seeing this movie you  ll thank me . the story is a lot of nonsense about some stolen videotape or something . a bunch of dim  bulb caucasian heroes are trained in the ways the ninja because  only a ninja can fight a ninja  or something like that . strange  these guys don  t seem to fight any better after their training than before . . . oh well  the movie does move along pretty briskly . the fight scenes may not be great . . but they are plentiful . . . and the overdone sound effects are good for a few chuckles .  ,0
oh god  what a horrible  horrible film . meant to be a comment on the state of society  it  s just a reflection of the worst of the worst in reality tv . interstitials hosted by jason jones and don mckellar are the most obnoxious part  written in a tone that is perhaps meant to be reflexive and insightful . rather  these moments are mind numbing as they speak to the camera with dialogue written by someone with a love for insulting  condescending speech that shoves the  meaning  of the film down the viewer  s throat .  br    br   also  a point to would  be filmmakers long takes and quiet scenes do not equal art . neither do extreme angles or logic stretched to the point of absurdity .  br    br   if anyone out there is interested in watching this film  please don  t . seriously . please . you have better things to do .  ,0
let me get the bad out of the way first  james hanlon is absolutely terrible trying to act his descriptions of what was going on with the rookie training and events of the day . really it is in stark contract to the other fire fighters without acting aspirations who are natural in their delivery .  br    br   that said it is an amazing film that is impossible to watch without tears in my eyes . i am an english guy from london but i love new york and have visited many many times before and after september   th . it is a second home to me and i can  t help but feel devastated at the loss of life but also the destruction of part of such an amazing beautiful city . this is the real deal  in with the fire fighters with everything collapsing around them . i am so glad the footage exists to show people how it was on the day . it is a shame that they didn  t use any footage of people jumping from the buildings because friends who were there tell me this is such a major part of their memory  it should be included to show future generations just how terrible it really was .  br    br   conspiracy theorists can go to hell by the way .  ,1
it  s been   years since gordon gekko used  wall street  to let us know that greed is good . now  michael douglas takes the gg persona and morphs it into a secret service agent  pete garrison . guess what  it works  this is a solid political thriller that kept me guessing . the detail work in showing the security precautions taken by the ss on behalf of the president and first lady was likewise intriguing . all the leads were pretty good but  try as i might  i could not accept eva longoria as a secret service agent . whereas jodie foster just made you suspend belief and really think she was fbi agent starling in  silence of the lambs   you do not get the same feeling with longoria . nevertheless  this is a fun film  escapist entertainment with the beltway as the backdrop .  ,1
one of my favorite movies  with a very nostalgic ending . the movie is about the sullivan family  obviously michael sullivan  the father  is one of the main members of the mafia  the killer to say it this way  and an expert one . one of the kids wants to know the work of his father  a terrible mistake   so he hides on his father  s car and well  he sees tom hanks in action to say it this way .  br    br   mafia doesn  t rules  in mafia nobody wins  when they want you out  they take you out . of course you can see anyone who works at the mafia with a giant house  the best car in the world  whatever you like  but make a wrong work  or make something your  boss  doesn  t want  and you  re fired  and killed .  br    br   you can see what i mean in the movie  sullivan jr . sees something he didn  t had to see  and well  almost all his family gets killed for that  wrong thing  his son did . the movie is really entertaining  you see how the sullivan  s live after being chased by the mafia  or kinda of that .  br    br   this movie is kinda of sad  shows us about revenge  those dirty works people do  almost everything you like . hopefully the guy is reading this comment doesn  t works for the mafia  and if you work at the mafia make yourself a favor and get the hell out of the country before you get killed by your boss and their workers .  br    br   this movie receives       ,1
and how many actors can he get to stand in for his own neurotic  compulsive uber  new yorker persona  in this film woody is played by will ferrell in what is mercifully less a direct impersonation than the one kenneth branagh did in  celebrity .  it  s an annoyingly repetitive story now nebbishy  neurotic man with a wife or girlfriend falls madly in love with a shiksa queen upon which he projects all manner of perfection . everyone lives in perfect gigantic apartments in great manhattan neighborhoods  everyone constantly patronizes expensive  exclusive restaurants during which all the characters relate fascinating anecdotes and discuss arcane philosophy  there is always a trip to the hamptons during which the nebbishy main character spazzes out about sand and physical exertion and possible exposure to diseases  and then of course  said main character feels guilty about his lust for the shiksa queen but pursues her anyway  sometimes succeeding  sometimes failing  etc .  br    br   this a tired formula  and proof that allen isn  t really a great film artist at all . he just seems like a dirty old man with the libido and emotions of a    year  old who is intent upon telling the same boring old stories again and again .  ,0
director  writer michael winner  s feature is a better than expected offbeat supernatural horror film  although still schlock efficiently catered for   which really does by go unnoticed . sure it might borrow ideas from other similar themed horror movies of this period  but still manages to bring its own psychological imprint to the smokescreen material  of good vs . evil  and a unique vision that has a fair share of impressively expansive  if somewhat exploitative set  pieces . as a whole it  s sketchy  however remains intriguing by instilling an ominous charge without going gang  busters with the scares . actually there  s always something going on amongst its busy framework  but it  s rather down  played with its shocks steering to soapy patterns and atmospheric tailoring  up until its vividly repellent and grisly climax with a downbeat revelation . winner  s dressed up craftsmanship might feel pedestrian  however it  s the ensemble cast that really holds it together as you try to spot the faces . there  s plenty too . some having more to do with the scheme of things than others  but there  s no doubts every one of them are committed  despite the ludicrously crude nature of it all . it  s interesting to see names like sylvia miles  who  s significantly creepy    beverly d  angelo  likewise   deborah raffin  eli wallach  christopher walken  william hickey  a neat cameo   jeff goldblum  jerry orbach and tom berenger in bit parts . then you got a mild  mannered chris sarandon and movingly gorgeous cristina raines in the leads . offering able support jos ferrer  martin balsam  ava gardner  john carradine  burgess meredith and arthur kennedy . the script does throw around many characters  as well as notions but gets disjointedly sidetrack by trying to squeeze all of it in . however it  s disorienting air works in its favour in establishing the suspicion and deception of what  s really going on here . is there a reason for all of this  and why is it surrounding raines  character  the emphasis is mainly built upon that moody angle  as it begins to slowly shed light of her inner goings and that of the strange  worrying experiences she encounters when she  s moves into her new apartment . this is where winner tries to pull out the eerie shades  which projects some icy moments . gil melle was the man responsible for the grand  overpowering orchestral score that never misses a cue and richard c . kratina instruments the sweeping  scope  like photography .  ,1
this was a blind buy used dvd . it totally killed a nice buzz i had going when i hit play .  br    br   it  s bubble  headed comedy  but it  s um . squalid . the plot is zany   but the characters do things to each other that are so petty and disturbed and conveniently contrived i ultimately found it depressing to watch .  br    br   maybe the box lead me to expect something more than an uneven  goofy caper film .  i know  i know  the quotes on the box  the academy award nomination mean nothing .   ,0
badly directed garbage . a mediocre nihilist sadistic gorefest . . . if you are the sort of person who likes that . . . see a shrink . even if you are that person it doesn  t make this a good film  the acting is really poor  the story full of plot holes  the director really should just give up and find a real job as he has no talent for this one . i can see why people dislike uwe boll . . we have had a few of his films on lately and this is the best of them  which is really sad  a complete absence of any sort of humanity seems to suit some people but here it just grates . horror films can be full of desolation  they can be miniature works of art  they can be just good viewing when there is nothing else on . . . seed is just really really poor .  ,0
this movie may seem scary on commercials  but the actual movie was a reason to vomit . this is a below below average   even lower than that  and has no plot . i mean every house can make you feel scared and sure  a dead japanese woman would scare the poop out of you  but so what  make a movie that would appeal to watchers and not just show images of scared people and some hair  dead japanese woman  . can you say  horrible rip  off of samara  the ring    don  t get me started with the  dead child  . not even that scary  so what  he has a cat and he can imitate it  big freaking deal  just bury the poor zombies and save some lives that have the potential of being harmed by the grudge       yuck   .   ,0
i liked this tv show because it was it  s own thing a girl who is on her sixteenth birthday finds out that she is a witch and her she lives with her aunties in the house and they are both witches as well . well this took her about a few weeks of getting used to . when she used her powers for the first time it was so funny because she turned her enemy into a pineapple . she had to turn back time and repeat a day . this series is really cool and it is a typical teenage series but it wore thin when she moved out of her house and to an apartment with her fellow college friends and then it got boring and i stopped watching . i loved her aunties they were so funny and the other one was really ditzy . i loved valerie and i hated sabrina  s enemy libby she was ugly .  ,1
i saw this ages ago when i was younger and could never remember the title  until one day i was scrolling through john candy  s film credits on imdb and noticed an entry named  once upon a crime . . .  . something rang a bell and i clicked on it  and after reading the plot summary it brought back a lot of memories .  br    br   i  ve found it has aged pretty well despite the fact that it is not by any means a  great  comedy . it is  however  rather enjoyable and is a good riff on a hitchcock formula of mistaken identity and worldwide thrills .  br    br   the movie has a large cast of characters  amongst them an american couple who find a woman  s dog while vacationing in europe and decide to return it to her for a reward  only to find her dead body upon arrival . from there the plot gets crazier and sillier and they go on the run after the police think they are the killers .  br    br   kind of a mix between  it  s a mad mad mad mad world  and a lighter hitchcock feature  this was directed by eugene levy and he managed to get some of his good friends  such as john candy  to star in it . the movie is mostly engaging due to its cast  and the ending has a funny little twist that isn  t totally unpredictable but also is kind of unexpected .  ,1
i thought the movie was a poor documentary . nothing of substance was discussed . it seemed to cheapen the ideas and did not provide anything new . the film lacked wonder or romance or anything that would really drive one to science . most scientists appeared  stereotyped  and sometimes weird . a woman said that her awards didn  t matter a whole lot  only children that were helped . she said that after a   minute scene where she explained all her awards . playing  humble scientist   are we   i have equations dancing in my head   another said . i don  t see how that explains anything to us . it hasn  t covered significant effects of science on our culture . politics of science were barely touched .  br    br   not a bad flick for a      year  olds . other than that  i felt it was boring and unrevealing .  br    br        ,0
dennis hopper is without a doubt one of the finest underrated american actors of our time  and it was interesting to see how he would play out his role as a cop on the case of a child serial killer . most movies hopper has always played to psychotic menace threatening to blow up stuff or go on a killing spree  but in this movie  hopper tried his best to keep that intensity and emotion while carrying a shield . once i got into the plot of the movie  i was hooked  but it  s just the little things that ultimately murdered the film .  br    br   the concept of the film is great  not only are the cops on the move of catching the killer  but we get a chance to see how the gangsters operate in catching the killer . the subplot of the football stadium is kinda ridiculous  but necessary to involve the gangsters in the killer hunt .  br    br   that  s about all that is good you can say about the film . although hopper did try to act like a tough  experienced street smart cop  i can  t help but feel his acting was below par  and there wasn  t enough conviction that he was truly attached to the case . the directing was also terrible  it didn  t have the feel of a true film  but rather a tv  movie production . this is most evident when the gangsters meet for the first time to form an elite team to hunt the killer down . when the leading gangster shoots the other mouthy gangster in slow motion  the acting was weak  predictable and terribly unexciting . that  s when i knew that  st of all  the action is going to be atrocious .  br    br   the angling of the camera was amateurish  and the recalling scenes or haunting images of the killer  s little sister had no true distinctive effect . if it was supposed to be scary  it wasn  t . everyone  s acting was terrible  and even for hopper  i didn  t feel for his character  and i just didn  t really care too much about his relationship with his daughter .  br    br   the final thing that bothered me the most is the swat team . once i saw the swat team in action  i was thinking  finally  something good . but i was wrong .  st of all  the entire swat team consisted of  guys . that is just impossible .  nd of all  apparently the swat team has no training whatsoever because many times in the film they carry their hka  submachine guns with one hand . had the killer been hiding near the staircase with a shotgun  these  idiots would  ve been blown to bits because they weren  t even aiming at anything or paying close attention . they should have had both hands on the gun aiming forward  but it just looks like they  re not taking the job seriously and are just flaunting around .  rd  swat team members do not yell out commands such as  keep your eyes open  watch out for yourselves  are we good to go . . . etc .  in reality  they use hand signals or have radios . but they  re literally yelling at each other  how are you supposed to catch the killer when he can hear you  re coming    and to top it all off  these guys have no plan  apparently they  re just running up and down going on a wild turkey chase . eventually they end up doing nothing . that was the last straw . i  m no expert on special forces  but basically what i  ve just outlined  is pretty common sense . when the audience knows the movie is terrible  the action pretty much becomes the life  saver of the movie  when you can  t even make an effort to make the action great  the movie is lost .  br    br   i give  stars for the concept  but the rest cannot be credited . if you want to watch a crime thriller  don  t bother with this one . there  s plenty of crime in the movie  but it has the lack of thrill .  ,0
most movies about  or set in  new orleans  turn out to be laughably bad  and laughably inaccurate  examble remember  the savage bees   but i  ll make an exception for  tightrope   which almost got it right  .  br    br   here  s one that doesn  t inevitably get it wrong . the accents are not too bad  yes  the  yat  accent down here is way more brooklynese than southern   the city of     is shown the way it is  was  without the obligatory  tourist  shots  and they understand a good drama without trying to make everyone a  quirky southerner  .  br    br   one of the few films to do justice to this city  and a good film to boot . .  ,1
this movie is a real gem . the arc of the the plot is defined in the first  minutes  the characters are sympathetic and clearly drawn  their motives completely believable . the dialogue is fresh  and oh so real . the situations are unique to the characters and not at all cliched or hackneyed . until the climax  that is . then it  s as if the movie went off the rails a bit and it got a bit hokey and unbelievable . but i don  t want to discourage people from watching this film . the first     s of it are truly remarkable . i gave it an  . there are some remarkable performances here . check out this movie .  ,1
trawling through the sci fi weeklies section of the local video rentals store i was losing hope of finding any good movies i hadn  t yet seen . renting cypher was like a punt on a possibly very lame horse . my son is so jaded with current  b  science fiction that he hasn  t bothered seeing this yet .  br    br   it must be noted i didn  t see anything about cypher when it was released in australia . it must have been very quiet or i just missed it .  br    br   well this was a really pleasant surprise  this is also no b movie . it  s not a  blockbuster  of the epic variety and doesn  t try to be  more a quiet movie that needs to be seen several times for it  s plot to be fully savoured .  br    br   the special effects are powerfully presented when they are used  my only complaint is the super helo is a leetle obviously cgi at first view  but they get it right at it  s  nd appearance   that aside everything else is top notch . in any case the affects are secondary .  br    br   i won  t give anything away about the plot . the plot structure has a russian doll aspect a little reminiscent of basic instinct  though with very different content  .  br    br   just i will say that choosing jeremy northam for the lead was a master stroke . the actor was born in cambridge england  and his accent for this film hits the ear as a sort of extremely forced new england dialect  it  s a tad off key . see the final twist of the plot and you  ll see why that is such a brilliant choice  and lucy liu is also just right with her  will she kiss me  will she shoot me  edge .  br    br   i rarely watch movies several times within days  this is one of them .  ,1
i knew that  evening  was a girlie film  so i was expecting to be bored . a wicked tease on imdb had said that it was a  chick flick  but that your companion would survive .  br    br   survive  yes . i am still here  but when the two of us came out we were amazed to find that it had only lasted two hours  it seemed a much longer evening than that  i suppose that  for yanks  it is supposed to be elevating or fascinating because it is about rich people living on the beach  well  next to the beach  in a house with a wide verandah and a lawn but no apparent lawnmower . if that sort of thing impresses you it might seem quite a short film .  br    br   there  s a monty python film about a knight who just won  t die . he ends up a wriggling  why do yanks add an third syllable to this word i wonder  torso in the road still shouting threats at his nemesis . this film is also about a sort of living dead . vanessa redgrave  inappropriate name for the grave dodger shown here  goes on and on dying whilst having inappropriate guilt . she  s not worried about having been a wide  eyed  breathless bimbo  but imagines herself a murderess .  br    br   obviously  being a girlie film  there  s a chap who is supposed to be the mr darcy  heathcliff character . i  m not a woofter  so i can  t claim to be a good judge of such things  but the tedious wimp who is wheeled out for this role seems only to have the title of servant in his favour . he  s a bloodless cypher .  br    br   as you might gather  the main characters aren  t much cop  but the minor ones manage  amazingly to be much worse . there  s a fellow whose only job is to react to the news that his girlfriend is preggers . fair enough  but it isn  t the role of hamlet  why ham it up so badly  forgetting that it was a girlie film  i thought he was going to be thrown out because any decent girl  friend would have told him that face  fungus didn  t flatter him  but then i realised that she must have encouraged him to grow a  beard  because he looked worse without it .  br    br   i kept awake by noticing which actors and actresses had their earlobes attached or free and noting interesting bits of scenery  if you  re dragged along to it  see if you can spot the stuffed buffalo head  just the sort of thing you  d expect in a beach cottage .  br    br   apart from the obligatory wedding  there is only one piece of action . you  d have thought that they  d have got it right . sadly  though  the hit and run accident is carried out by a car that couldn  t be there . when the accident is discovered the cast wander about shouting for a character that they can  t know is nearby  but we do as the audience  . if they don  t have any clue that the person is within a couple of miles of the place  then why do they wander about aimlessly shouting for him  i suppose that the director  s excuse is that it is supposed to be a half  remembered dream sequence . . .  br    br   another scenery item that caught my attention was a copper bottomed saucepan . i didn  t think that the technology to do this was developed until the fifties .  ,0
adapting plays into cinema is often a bad idea because they  re two different mediums . do you think it  s a great idea to make zulu into a stage play  imagine it where two valiant redcoats sit in a tent gasping  blimey there  s thousands of them out there  great movie and a bad stage play  br    br   in order for a stage play to make great cinema there  s two essentials needed  br    br     a fine cast that creates on screen chemistry  br    br     great dialogue  br    br   on paper cher and chazz palminterri would be a good casting choice but not in these roles . the story revolves around a hit  man played by palminterri breaking into a house to kill a wife played by cher with most of the action taking place inside the house . i was unable to take these two characters seriously though perhaps it was the fault of the script which can  t decide whether it was trying to be serious or funny . since the story is very static it  s of the utmost importance that the dialogue shines and once again because of the bizarre tone of the screenplay it embarrasses more than anything else with much of the conversation revolving around sex acts . if you want to see a great translation of a stage play transferred to the silver screen give faithful a miss and watch   angry men instead  ,0
black guy becomes rich white guy  and rich white guy seems to embrace hip  hop culture  and most of the  funny  moments of this film play off of this . the problem i have is that it doesn  t work and almost never works .  br    br   ok  so no one would expect lance to grab a body like that and suddenly start acting like charles wellington . that would be too much to ask . i  ll grant that . but at the same time  it goes too far the other direction . i  m supposed to imagine a rich white guy singing rap and completely upending things  playing like he  s a bastion of hip  hop culture  and people just accept him  and what about sontee  who falls in love with him as a rich white guy  even though she doesn  t care about his money or power  this is so completely unbelievable it  s not even funny .  br    br   i just couldn  t suspend disbelief and i couldn  t finish the movie . i added one extra star because it did make me laugh  even hard  a couple of times . but i just couldn  t get get past the whole  white guy doing hip hop  thing that has never been well done in any movie i  ve ever seen that tries it . this was no exception .  ,0
this was just a terrible movie . it hurt me to watch it . almost every action was unmotivated within the context of the movie  the acting was really poor  p . diddy was the best actor which really says something about the movie  and the plot was generally predictable . some links to carlito  s way were okay  for example his dream of one day moving to the carribien  but on the whole they were weak . the love interest in my opinion was flat out wrong but hey that  s debatable . anyways i really wasn  t expecting much before watching the movie and i guess you could say even those expectations weren  t met . i feel bad for jay hernandez because he actually is a decent actor  friday night lights  . he  s lucky though because i  m sure there won  t be too many people watching this movie . i generally give movies a decent rating if they spark my interest at all so i  m gonna go ahead and give this one two stars . better luck next time . and yes i did enjoy carlito  s way .  ,0
creature unknown is the right word for this movie . or maybe it should be called unknown movie . this movie is a piece of crap right from the beginning . it has a really stupid  plot   really pathetic  acting   and so  so  special effects .   br    br   some thirty  something year old  post  teens  are trapped in the woods with a mad  reptilian  rubber  suit creature lurking around endlessly . what you get with this movie is a bunch of talk and precious little action . you have girls walking through the woods talking  and then you have guys  with heavy mascara on  walking through the woods talking . the whole thing is so boring   br    br   the creature itself is rarely seen throughout most of the movie . when it is shown the picture is distorted to mask the fact that it is a man in a rubber suit  and the movement shows that it is a suit  hence the reason for the blurring and distortion of the image .  br    br   this is not a good movie in any since of the word and the ones here who have praised it are most likely the people that were picked up off the street to  act  in this truly stupefying movie  skip this one for certain   ,0
since it has been some years since i reviewed this classic i have decided to go back and review it more in dept  but first some insider notes from a movie critic .  br    br   this animated series is one of those that i grew up with  it made my childhood joyful  it made it awesome  miss some of this stuff today that we clearly don  t see as much as we did back in the days  well on to the review . . .  br    br   talespin  or luftens helte which it is called in denmark is a great animated series  it is much like chip and dale  ducktales and a lot of those old ones  so it has that weird feeling surrounding it  i cannot remember this series as much as i would like to remember it .  br    br   but in my opinion it was very great  it came with some kind of message  not that wild of a message  however it is one of the old ones so that can be forgiven .  br    br   now i don  t want to sound old or anything but i feel like time slipped out of my hands with these cartoons  today we see something like ed edd and eddy or anything else weird like that  we have all these new or nearly new shows like hannah montana or something like that  yet i feel like that we don  t have the same spirit in cartoons or real shows like we did in the early days .  br    br   now maybe i am wrong but i feel like time has changed to much  to conclude i would be thrilled to see these series like talespin being released again to the tv screen instead of all the new ones  give me back my childhood cartoons  give them to the kids i have some day  give them again . . .  ,1
gorgeous bodies  gorgeous colors and camera work  pretentious dialog  banal plot . the name of the prima donna  camilla  and the eponymous flowers that appear frequently  are enough to remind us of the plot similarities from dumas  novel la dame aux camelias  the movie camille starring garbo and  i think  robert taylor  and last but not least verdi  s opera la traviata . beautiful  not  too  virtuous young ladies  social outcasts for one reason or another  loved  split up  reunited just in time to die of tuberculosis in the last scene . . . one forgives banal plots and stupid unrealistic dialog in opera  but why waste hayak  don sutherland  a beautiful rendition of la in the   s  a deus ex machina earthquake that conveniently kills the other woman  and all that beauty on this mediocre turkey where there isn  t even any beautiful singing   ,0
it surprises me that i actually got the courage to watch the bio flick or flicks  che parts     . why  because if my cuban exile parents would ever found out i saw this movie about this despicable mass murderer of the cuban revolution  i would be grounded for life . hey wait  i am an adult  they can  t ground me no mas . director steven soderbergh  and newbie commie  sorry steven  but i had to take soder shots here  divides the movie in two partes on commander ernesto  che  guevara  s revolutionary life .  che part   presents how che in the mid      s joined fidel castro  s guerilla crew in their revolutionary quest to overthrow cuban president fulgencio batista  s regime which as we all know was a revolutionary success for them  but a gargantuan guerilla disaster to many cubans as it revolted into communism .  che part   presents che trying to revolutionize the t  shirt industry by pitching t  shirts with his appalling bearbado face to t  shirt manufacturers . ok  i am che  chatting a lot of crap towards your way  i meant to say the  che part   focuses on che in the late    s trying to bring back the revolution  this time to a poverty  stricken bolivia  but with far different results . in fact  che ended up being dead meat enchelada when he was captured and killed by the bolivian militia in     . soderbergh does not include the in  between time of those two instances in che  s life when he commanded the despicable la cabana fortress prison in cuba  where he mass murdered many cubans who opposed communism . that is where i think soderbergh executed a cinematic injustice by not showing the viewers how atrocious guevara really was . i did decide to see  che  in hopes that soderbergh would not glamorize him  but instead present how disturbed he really was . unfortunately  soderbergh did not do the latter and sadly decided to present guevara as a revolutionary hero  which he was not . he was a sick man who thank god is now probably at the bottom of the devil barrel . now  i do have to be an objectivistic reviewer and must admit that benicio del toro  s performance as che was extremely commanding  and worthy of merit . and that demian bichir was a haunting dead  ringer as fidel castro in his meticulous performance . but the rest of the cast of  che  was primarily comprised of mediocre performances of actors portraying guerilla soldiers . and as much as i do admire matt damon  why did sodebergh throw him in the revolutionary mix in a spanish  speaking cameo performance portraying a bolivian delegate  soderbergh did not have to present this biopic which is mostly  too much talk and not enough action  in  hours and   minutes . we have had too much of che already  even posthumously with those ridiculous t  shirts  so why give us too much more of him  but i guess when you have the del toro by the horns  as you did here steven   i guess it is your saving grace for not totally executing  che parts     .  average  ,1
the film had some likable aspects . perhaps too many for my taste . it felt as though the writer  director was desperately trying to get us to feel the inner conflict of all of its characters . not once  a few times . . . but all of the time .  br    br   this is the job of television  not cinema .  br    br   the location of the train station was well chosen and i enjoyed sascha horler  s performance as the pregnant friend .  br    br   i felt as though justine clarke  s performance was wan . her reactions to things felt forced  as though the director were trying to vocalise the themes of the film through her protagonist  s expressions . i also can  t believe that a director can make the wonderful daniela farinacci into an unbelievable presence .  br    br   i cannot understand the choice of pop music slapped over entire sequences . this is a lazy device  especially where the pop music comes from no place diagetic to the film and  or where the lyrics of the song feel embarrassingly earnest .  br    br   that said  there is a breezy quality about the film that evokes the australian heat and local attitude with originality . it does create an atmosphere of heat and sunshine . especially with the usage of wonderful animation sequences that rescue the film from complete mediocrity  infusing it with passion and hand  crafted charm .  br    br   i am curious why the dialogue feels so overworked .  who knows if there  s a god  like some guy sitting there up in the sky telling us what to do  or whatever the line was .  br    br   perhaps one of the more embarrassing moments was the friend returning home from cricket with a bunch of flowers to declare to his wife  i  m giving up smoking .   br    br   an anti  smoking commercial  a tac ad with some tasteful animation  i had to leave the cinema at the   minute mark   it was all too much .  ,0
this is the kind of film that  if it were made today  it would probably star sandra bullock and hugh grant actually  now that i think about it  this one is quite liable to be remade one day . it  s pleasant  but with no depth whatsoever . it suffers from the almost fatal miscasting of james stewart in a role he is about   years too old for  and as a result there is no chemistry between him and the beautiful kim novak . ernie kovacs  in the small supporting role of an aspiring writer  is the only actor in the film whose performance approaches what you might call  wit  .        ,1
what an unfortunate mess is  shiner .  i wanted to like this over  the  top  anti  film aspirant  and in fact found a number of moments with powerful resonance . sadly  those moments are few and far between . while i appreciate some of what calson was attempting  any advantage aspired to by bare bones  no budget cinematography was destroyed with some truly atrocious editing that benefited the movie not at all .  br    br   while bad acting abounds in low budget  and big budget  cinema  shiner has some remarkably bad performances that are nearly painful to watch . in particular the  straight  couple linda and young guy . these are the two most poorly written characters offering almost nothing to the story . the acting is so abysmal and neither actor seems capable of resisting smirking or cracking up as they drearily drop their lines with an appalling lack of skill . the choppy editing almost lends the feeling that these roles were entirely gratuitous and dropped in to avoid the films being stereotypically cast as an oddball gay film . it would have been better off as such .  br    br   with all that is going wrong for it  there are several performances that seem to capture what calson was hoping to get . in particular the story centering on bob and tim . these are the two most richly drawn characters and offer the most rewards with genuinely captivating performances by nicholas t . king  bob  and david zelinas  tim  . tim is a boxer with some serious issues . remarkably low self esteem is disguised by an almost cartoon like arrogance that he wears like armour plating . obsessed with tim  the seemingly harmless yet ultimately creepy bob  stalks the boxer in classic cat  and  mouse fashion . when the tables are turned and hunter becomes the hunted  the resulting in the film  s only genuine emotional catharsis . in a film so artificially hard  edged  that  s a compliment  one character must have that revelatory break through  or breakdown  as the case proves here  and the final confrontation between bob and tim provide zelinas and king opportunity to display some real acting chops .  br    br   as played by scott stepp and derris nile  tony and danny seem to be the focus of the movie  and despite some bravado moments of their own  including one truly disturbing scene revealing the sex  violence obsession   but they can  t seem to escape a cartoon  like artifice and it  s difficult to look at  or beyond their seeming one note symphony and find anything other than the obvious .  br    br   ultimately this same raw material could  and should  be used to tell this story in better fashion . alas  there really isn  t much to recommend this yet  the performances by messrs . king and zelinas  really do offer something special and a glimpse of what might have been and are ultimately worth seeing .  ,0
having decided some time ago to collect the films of billy bob thornton  on the strength of class movies like  sling blade    a simple plan  and  the man who wasn  t there  amongst others   it was inevitable that there would be the odd turkey in there . what i didn  t realise however  was that there could be one this bad . i  ll give you an idea how incredibly poor this film is  the funniest dialogue in it goes like this  knock knock    who  s there     the big stinking man    the big stinking man who     the big stinking man  is you   . yes folks  it really is that bad . billy bob is only in it for about two minutes  i guess he needed the work at that time in his career   and the rest of the movie is painful . for some reason though  although it  s undeniably awful  i don  t hate it . that  s probably because i save my ire for any high budget  special effects laden junk like  the fast and the furious  and not a  no  budget  flick like this one .     at a push .  ,0
this is a baffling film .  br    br   the beauty in sexual relations between men and women is shown degraded by a set of men and women who can only be described as a collection of oddballs and misfits .  br    br   greenaway acknowledges his inspiration to fellini  s film       but whereas fellini is a titan of world cinema  greenaway is not .  br    br   he has none of the maestro  s lightness of touch nor his ability to convey feelings and emotions with a deftness of clarity .  br    br   he is pretentious  the film being divided into chapters with a written introduction to each  as if the viewer has to be guided into the film except that the written notices only stay on screen for a few seconds  not long enough to be read by the audience with the result that they are mostly ignored .  br    br   as for the women  only two can be described as lookers  palmira  played by polly walker and giaconda played by natacha amal . the rest ooze with ordinariness . both the women and the men retreat from the harsh light of reality into the dim shades of fantasy .  br    br   greenaway obviously wants to make the point that sexual fantasy does not lead to happiness . the women themselves are depressing since they render their services in exchange for money . relations between men and women are debased into a commercial transaction .  br    br   there is no sense of joy or happiness or love in the film  indeed there are several scenes that are deeply unpleasant   br    br   the suggestion of an incestuous relationship between father and son  philip and storey emmental played respectively by john standing and matthew delamere . the callous disregard of both men that giaconda is carrying their child  she in fact  gets pregnant twice  the first foetus being aborted and the second time  she is sent away to a destination chosen by the men from a flight book . both men having sex with a woman who has no legs   the half woman in the title  . the beastiality that exists between beryl  played by amanda plummer  with a pig named hortense . father and son sharing women between them . women enjoying being beaten sexually . the father sleeping with the corpse of his dead wife .  br    br   mercifully  none of these scenes are shown sexually  only hinted at .  br    br   the hinted degradation of women is such that there cannot be any wonder that the film was booed at when it was first premiered at cannes . what is more extraordinary is that the actresses in the film lined up to defend it  showing yet again that there is no limit to the naivety of women and that women will fool themselves into being exploited by men .  br    br   greenaway  s directorial style is pretentious  it is a triumph of style over substance  a depiction of film as art accompanied by the abandonment of common sense .  br    br   greenaway tries to attain the sublimity of surrealism but only succeeds in showing the banality of human relationships .  ,0

i just came from seeing this movie and decided to see what others thought of it . i  m left wondering if these people who give glowing reviews saw the same film  this is potentially a very good story  but it fails to hit the mark . the script is very weak  the plot has so many holes that it would make a great dip net for the fishing scenes . the characters were not well developed and the storyline jumps around so much that i found myself asking the question  how did we get here   at least a half dozen times during the movie .  br    br   there was a lack of any chemistry between the cast members . this is probably related to lindsay lohan  s antics during the filming . it was pretty clear that everyone showed up and did their job  but didn  t commit to their roles .  br    br   this is not a movie worth seeing . . . go for a walk  play a board game  take a nice warm bath and save your money for something that  s worth it   ,0
steven seagal movies have never been oscar material but with each passing release they get worse and worse .  br    br   this one starts with seagal getting picked up by the fbi because he killed a few people  in self defence  he  s active military so is saved from jail to rescue a stolen stealth plane that will be used by the clich  evil english villain  that hollywood is so obsessed with including these days .  br    br   suffice to say the film has terrible dialog that is almost always delivered with a hefty topping of cheese and lack of acting talent . the story isn  t interesting and there are segments of it which make absolutely no sense and do not add anything to the story  characters of movie as a whole such as the  lesbian  interaction between the two main females in the cast which is there purely for titilation to get viewers and yet isn  t even titilating just confusing as it makes no sense as to why it happened when it didn  t need to .  br    br   in short a terrible script with bad dialog  delivered by sub  par actors  boring and at times badly choreographed action scenes  and non  relevant parts that only serve to achieve the near  impossible and make the movie even worse .  br    br   save   minutes of your life and give this miss  even if you are seagal  s most ardent fan .  ,0
paris  je t  aime       is a film made up of   segments . you can do the math     segments in    minutes means each director had seven minutes to tell her or his story . the movie is based on the premise that you can  indeed  tell a story in that short amount of time . the premise works . almost all of the segments are powerful  complete  and satisfying . each presents a different aspect of the parisian experience  and almost every director draws forth outstanding performances from a cast of great and near  great actors .  br    br   there were so many powerful portrayals in this film that it  s hard to pick one or two favorites . probably the most memorable to me were juliette binoche as a grieving mother in the segment  place des victoires   gena rowlands as an aging beauty in  quartier latin   catalina sandino moreno as a maid in the segment  loin du   me  and margo martindale as a colorado mail carrier who has learned to speak french so she can visit paris     me arrondissement  segment  .  br    br   special mention must be given to gulliver hecq  probably the meanest little boy to ever harass an american tourist in a parisian metro station  segment  tuileries   .  br    br   this is an outstanding movie . my wife and i decided to rent it in a few months so we can catch some of the subtle points we surely missed . however  paris is photographed so beautifully that i would suggest that you try to see it on a large screen . in any case  don  t miss it   ,1
having read diamond  s book  i was slightly disappointed in the series  but all in all  it is quite informative . reading the other comments  it is comforting to know that the  culture warriors  are hard at work  seeing  attacks  on  western civilization  under every rug .  br    br   is diamond a little preachy  sure . like a lot of academics  he sees his theory as the most important thing ever . he uses the phrase  guns  germs  and steel  at seemingly every opportunity during the series . we get it  after about the first   minutes .  br    br   is diamond a little simplistic  in the series   sure . the part about the spaniards in south america is particularly amusing  condensing some very long  complicated history down to  smallpox  swords  and horses   wrapping up the whole conquest of south america in about   minutes . but the point remains valid  these things did in fact contribute  but not totally define  the reasons for the spaniard  s success against the established cultures .  br    br   is he preaching against western civilization in any way  nope . not a word . not to my ear . all he says is that luck played a large part in determining which cultures advanced more quickly  not that luck is the only reason .  br    br   in the end  if you  re looking for something that validates your own sense of superiority  then this series is not for you . but if you are interested in all of the factors than influence how societies succeed or fail  this series presents a useful interpretation of the historical evidence .  ,1
this is one of the funniest movies i  ve ever seen . i rented it as a joke  expecting to get a giggle out of the first few scenes  and let me just say i  ve never laughed so hard in my life . the first scene where ninjas randomly pop out of the air and start a huge and ridiculous fire fight is one of the most incredibly funny stupid action movie moments of my life . this is not a dinosaur movie  but more a movie that makes fun  and doesn  t mean to at all  of the action genre . i didn  t see the first two  but judging by the complexity of the plot  i don  t think there  s to much i missed . if you wanna see a movie that goes great with a six pack or any herbal remedy  than i insist you rent this movie and sit back and watch a    years of advancement in cinema get thrown in the trash and get shat on by carnosours  ,0
what a shame that a really competent director like andre de toth who specialized in slippery  shifting alliances didn  t get hold of this concept first . he could have helped bring out the real potential  especially with the interesting character played by william bishop . as the movie stands  it  s pretty much of a mess  as asserted by reviewer chipe  . the main problems are with the direction  cheap budget  and poor script . the strength lies in an excellent cast and an interesting general concept   characters pulled in different directions by conflicting forces . what was needed was someone with vision enough to pull together the positive elements by reworking the script into some kind of coherent whole  instead of the sprawling  awkward mess that it is   try to figure out the motivations and interplay if you can  . also  a bigger budget could have matched up contrasting location and studio shots  and gotten the locations out of the all  too  obvious la outskirts . the real shame lies in a waste of an excellent cast   hayden  taylor  before his teeth were capped   dehner  reeves  along with james millican and william bishop shortly before their untimely deaths . few films illustrate the importance of an auteur  with  vision more than this lowly obscure western  which  in the right hands  could have been so much more .  ,0
in my humble opinion  this movie did not receive the recognition it deserved . robert redford lives near me here in provo  utah  at sundance . i enjoy most of his work  and this was my favorite . i  m sorry that more people didn  t appreciate it . my grandmother was an avid reader and read the book years before it came out on the big screen . she gave it to me to read after we had seen the movie together . the movie and book hit an emotional spot within my heart  and i was weepy for several days after seeing the movie . sometimes love isn  t enough to keep our loved ones from hurting themselves . we see this in our own family relationships  yet our love and our families and their stories endure throughout generations of time . the cinematography was perfect and breathtaking   i was awed by its beauty and how well it brought to life the words of the author of the book  norman maclean   but when i am alone in the half light of the canyon  all existence seems to fade to a being with my soul  and memories . and the sounds of the big black foot river  and a four count rhythm  and the hope that a fish will rise . eventually  all things merge into one  and a river runs through it . the river was cut by the world  s great flood and runs over rocks from the basement of time . on some of the rocks are timeless raindrops . under the rocks are the words  and some of the words are theirs . i am haunted by waters .  these words  taken from the book and spoken at the end of the movie  by robert redford who is narrating as norman maclean   are basically scripture  in my opinion . any possible flaws the movie may have are overshadowed by the beauty and grace of the story and the cinematography . it was beautiful   ,1
may i please have my    .   back  i would have rather watched  hydro  electric power comes to north america  . again . this is a movie with one voice . the same voice  which comes out of every characters mouth regardless of age or gender . to listen to that voice again i would have to charge at least     an hour . and i don  t take insurance . it was eerie watching will ferrell morph into woody . but i don  t think imaginative casting is enough . one should wait until they have a story before they bother making a movie . unless he  s just doing it for the money . and if that  s the case why not just reissue an all  rap version of  what  s up tiger lily    ,0

this movie was a complete waste of time .  br    br   i viewed this movie with a group of cinematic enthusiasts  who have varied taste in movies yet always a keen eye for a work of  genius   as one of my fellow commenters on this site had the gall to label this steaming pile   not one of them found a single redeeming quality . we ended the movie with a rousing chorus of expletives i will not reprint here .  br    br   i can only guess that the positive reviews provided here were written by sir anthony hopkins  himself . afterall  as one of those reviewers will tell you  he financed the film himself  because no one else in hollywood or anywhere else in the world  for that matter  would risk a single penny or their good name in association with this film . don  t let the semi  famous actors who appear in the film lure you into its clutches  as christian slater admits in the special features  making of  he signed on to the film without reading the script or knowing any details  a folly i am sure he will never repeat  .  br    br   i pity the hapless individual who stumbles into this quagmire of self  indulgence written  directed  produced  and financed by a man who is too famous to admit to himself that not everything he creates is a masterpiece  and if you don  t believe me please google  anthony hopkins  and art  .  ,0
this movie is even a big step down form the typical fare dished out by bollywood . the performances were horrible . even boman irani  who always manages to shine  goes completely ott as the villain . the soundtrack is not memorable either . and in spite trying hard  the female leads don  t manage to be  sexy  . vivek oberoi is capable of far better projects while fardeen khan seems to be stuck in similar fare for the time being . but this monstrosity is even beneath his limited capabilities as an actor . esha deol and amrita rao are horrible in badly written clich roles . it  s high time for indra kumar to hang up his directorial hat . hope he never directs another eyesore like this . future of hindi movies are in better hands now . to sum it up  stay far away from waste of celluloid .  ,0
the latest film by the spanish director agusti villaronga is a study on how children that experience violence and isolation within their remote community  develop into troubled young adults that need certain psychic tools to deal with their hidden mental frailty . whether these tools are religion followed to a fanatical level  caring for others or simply putting on a macho image whilst engaging as a male  prostitute  villaronga creates a successful examination of how these vices affect three teenagers living in spain under franco . the three witness the disturbing double death or their friends before they are teenagers and subsequently bury the emotions they feel with their peers frail corpses until they meet again once more at a hospital for those suffering form tuberculosis .  br    br   the cinematic style of the text is typically visually opulent as you would expect from the spanish auteur and is extremely reminiscent of fellow spaniard pedro almodovar  s work with themes dealing with sexual desire  both heterosexual and homosexual . an element that is different between the two directors is that villaronga favours a supernatural undertone spliced with claustrophobic  gritty realism opposed to almodovar  s use of surrealism  although both styles are similar .  br    br   the piece gives an insight into troubled young psyche and contains disturbing violence and scenes of a sexual nature . i highly recommend watching this film as it contains elements that will remain with the audience for a considerable period after viewing .  ,1

a series of random  seemingly insignificant thefts at her sister  s boarding house has miss lemon quite agitated . a ring  light bulbs  a rucksack  a lighter  a stethoscope  a shoe  there seems to be no rhyme or reason to any of it . miss lemon asks her employer  the great belgian detective hercule poirot  to look into the matter . but what poirot sees is something far more sinister than miss lemon could have imagined . and poirot  s fears are confirmed when one of the students living in the boarding house if found murdered . it  s up to poirot to bring a killer to justice .  br    br   hickory dickory dock is a solid  but not spectacular  entry in the long running poirot series . i appreciate how faithful the script is to agatha christie  s original story . i realize that certain liberties had to be taken  but i appreciate the effort nonetheless . the major points of the mystery are all there  the petty thefts  the boarding house  the students  the ripped rucksack  and  of course  poirot  s ability to see something sinister going on before it actually happens . with a few exceptions  the cast of students is almost as i pictured them . damian lewis and jessica lloyd standout among the group . as mush as i always enjoy david suchet  s poirot  i get a real kick out of the episodes with phillip jackson  s inspector japp and pauline moran  s miss lemon . this episode is a real treat as miss lemon gets more screen time than usual . finally  i enjoyed the use of the ever present mouse as an observer of the activities in the hostel . it  s a fun little play on the hickory dickory dock title .  br    br   i realized while re  watching hickory dickory dock just what a tremendous influence agatha christie  s work was on the highly stylized italian mystery films  or gialli  of the   s and   s . take the murder of mrs . nicoletis as an example . if you were to bump up the graphic nature of the scene  you would have something straight out of an early   s giallo . in fact  the entire plot of hickory dickory dock could have been used in a giallo . it  s just convoluted and interesting enough to have worked .  ,1
was this tim meadows first acting role in a movie  the character  leon  is funny enough but shortly after that the sexual jokes and humor are too dumb to listen to anymore . some movies can get away with the sexual jokes  and base their audiences to know that right when the advertising comes on . some movies that do this are american pie and scary movie . scary movie was stupid  and american pie wouldnt have done well without the sexual jokes . the only role  besides leon  that had some humor that followed was will ferrell . the character really was dumb and that was all  the dumb humor was all that had me watching . the movie was ok  and nothing else . i dont really understand why the snl people that are dying to leave the show always get a movie based on a character they played on the show . the skits last about  minutes  and if they can make a movie off a  minute skit  then what is the world coming to  molly shannon had superstar  cheri o  terri had scary movie  but she wasnt a leading role  and will had elf . but that was good  but he did some dumb movie  but i cant remember  and mike myers with wayne  s world . how come the mad tv crew dont ever get movie deals  seen only one guy break through  but only in like  movies and a tv show with andy dick . but that guy relies on comedy for his life to continue  funny or not . this movie is not good  but had some positive humor . what a waste of film and people  s money .  d d    ,0
when i started watching the show i said  oh  no  it  s as corny as elfen lied and not even that bloody   . and indeed  the setup is almost identical  with the single young boy living in a big house all by himself  then suddenly getting involved into a fantastic adventure while sexy young girls come live with him .  br    br   but this is where the resemblance stops . the love story is almost as subtle and intense as the one in inuiyasha  while the childish remarks and behaviors are very few . the magical setup is a bit corny  because it  s about seven people  with seven servants  fighting for the holy grail  all servants being someone famous  half of all masters being from the same school  rules of engagement  etc . however  this soon dims and fades from the beauty of the drawing and of the script .  br    br   i actually watched all   episodes in one day and  without comparing it with animes that i liked more  but were from other genres  i have to say that i was very pleased .  ,1
hugh  ed harris  is a hotshot  bachelor senator determined to run for president . one day  however  he happens upon an old high school classmate named aggie . aggie  diane keaton  is an accomplished and award  winning author with a lovely face and an independent spirit . hugh is smitten . he convinces aggie to become his fianc . but  will aggie have to sacrifice her principles of honesty in the world of politics  where things are not always what they seem to be  and  will she be able to withstand the rigors of a harsh media blitz  this is  mostly  a nice romance for those who adore tales of affection . hugh and aggie are absolutely in love and their banter and conversation are a good view . however  although the movie tries to show the political life in its reality  it doesn  t completely succeed . nevermind . the production values are high and the script is very elegantly written . with these advantages and the handsome personages of keaton and harris  those who sit down to the film will find it to be good entertainment .  ,1
but i doubt many were running to see this movie . or  some came running out of the cinema  . okay  that  s a bit harsh .  br    br   the film starts in an unintentionally comical way frankie  boy comes back to his hometown after many years  this already smells of clichs  and the whole town is shaken by his arrival he is talked about  everyone wants to talk to him  and every woman he meets flirts with him like there  s no tomorrow  even his niece hints that she would gladly have dropped her date to chat with frankie  boy a little longer  even his pretty niece wants a piece of him  sounds like one of those laughable  mike hammer  episodes where every single female wants stacey keach . and  like stacey keach  frankie  boy is anything but a good  looking woman  s wet dream . in real life  someone like sinatra  without the fame  wouldn  t get within    m of someone as beautiful as maclaine . but in this hollywood movie it  s the other way around maclaine is absolutely nuts about frankie  boy  but he couldn  t care less  sinatra plays his  cool  shtick much too often in his movies  and it is rarely credible . dean martin is kind of miscast he isn  t miscast as a card  player  but rather because of the accent which simply doesn  t suit him . maclaine is charming as ever  but she plays a caricature  and this reliance on caricatures is one of the basic problems with the film . the main characters are all some sort of stereotypes out of bad or seen  it  all  before movies and cheap novels frankie is the  cool cat  who comes back to town to get all the women  and he couldn  t care less about his writing  which  predictably  eventually garners recognition   martin is a sleazy but friendly card  player maclaine is the dumb  but very likable bimbo frankie  s blond love  interest is a snotty literary expert frankie  s brother is the successful guy who married into his wife  s business and has a lousy marriage and so on . clichs .  br    br   the story contains a couple of coincidences which are a little too far  fetched for my taste frankie just happens to bump into his niece in a locale his niece just happens to be meters away from her daddy when the latter kisses his secretary for the first time and then there is the awful  stupid ending .  br    br   in it  a drunk guy bent on killing frankie  boy somehow manages to find him in a carnival of all places  the place is utterly crowded  with the typical noise and chaos  plus it  s happening in the evening  and yet the guy somehow finds frankie  in spite of being drunk as a doorknob  and shoots at him . but guess who he kills  maclaine . she jumps in front of the bullet to save frankie a clich which comic  book writers might cringe at . this utterly pathetic  over  dramatic  and annoying ending certainly cannot please any  even semi  intelligent  viewer . and this happens on the same day that maclaine and sinatra got married  the writer of this nonsense seems to have read crappy dime novels his whole life  how else is the writing of this movie to be explained  there is even a card game in which a brawl ensues with frankie  martin vs . some clich caricatures out of the writer  s  vivid  imagination .  it was like a damn western suddenly .  another dumb thing is the way sinatra was crazy about the boring snotty  nosed bimbo and pretty much ignored maclaine . as the movie progresses we find out that sinatra finds maclaine to be too dumb for him  just as the blond bimbo finds sinatra to be too low  class for her . there is a certain snobbism and disdain to be detected in the script regarding maclaine . maclaine is treated as worthless by everyone  while the blond bimbo is treated as a princess and an intellectual the ironic truth is that the latter  s character comes off as rather dumb and not at all as intellectual her behaviour  comments  and opinions are mostly clichd  silly  confused  pretentious  and primitive . at least maclaine  s character knows that she  maclaine  is dumb . there is another irony that i didn  t fail to notice sinatra had trouble finding an ending for his latest story  much like the writer of this movie  and that  s why he came up with the corny  crappy finale .  br    br   the film basically has a solid cast  and the photography is nice  but the script  though sometimes okay  relies to heavily on silly nonsense instead of on reality  based characters and events .  br    br   if you  re interested in reading my  biographies  of shirley maclaine and other hollywood intellectuals  contact me by e  mail .  ,0
wonderful film  one of the best horror films of the   s . she is realistic settings and atmospheres . as usual it was inevitable the usual negative comments . i have noticed that most horror films of a certain period many times fail to reach even sufficiency . obviously because most horror movies are old and must be denigrati  is like a mental mechanism that moves the minds of the potential of music critics here .  br    br   before you read the review already knew what was the final judgment . in the film a good gift because   is really well done . raines reads quite well and the film as a way in which it was produced reminds me a lot of kubrick films . he really impression . excellent film really . i consider a film anthology of years    .  ,1
oh dear . good cast  but to write and direct is an art and to write wit and direct wit is a bit of a task . even doing good comedy you have to get the timing and moment right . im not putting it all down there were parts where i laughed loud but that was at very few times . the main focus to me was on the fast free flowing dialogue  that made some people in the film annoying . it may sound great while reading the script in your head but getting that out and to the camera is a different task . and the hand held camera work does give energy to few parts of the film . overall direction was good but the script was not all that to me  but i  m sure you was reading the script in your head it would sound good . sorry .  ,0
this is an odd film for me  as after i reviewed a nice film from a new film maker  far out by phil mucci   another writer  director  ryan jafri  contacted me and asked me to watch and review his film  the cure . i don  t normally review films this way  but what the heck   i love shorts and couldn  t wait to see another .  br    br   interestingly  while it turned out i did like the cure  i was not thrilled by it and let jafri know . to his credit  he encouraged me to review it anyway   giving it my honest appraisal .  br    br   the film has tremendous style and as far as jafri  s direction goes  it  s exceptional   especially for such an inexperienced film maker  it  s his first film  . the combination of exceptional choices of color  pacing and music that well  suited the film created a great sense of atmosphere . you really are pulled into the film and that is a credit to the film making . however  the thing i didn  t love was some of the writing . while the basic idea was great  the ending was just too easy to foresee . i really would have loved the ending had it come as more of a surprise or there to have been an unexpected twist . however  considering that this film is from someone who shouldn  t be able to make such a professional film given his experience  it bodes well for his future . good job .  ,1
this sci  fi adventure is not the best and by no means the worst . i agree with the statement that bad sci  fi is comical . bizarre pink tinting and unusual special effects make this a favorite for the late  late  late show viewers . space explorers on the planet mars fight off strange giant amoeba  like monsters and other strange creatures . pretty cool .  br    br   the cast includes les tremayne  naura hayden  gerald mohr and jack kruschen . get comfy and enjoy . don  t feel bad if you nod off for a moment . i agree with adding this to the list of cult classics to not miss .  ,0
john travolta  the biggest honkeytonk in the world  and a mechanical bull . . . what more can you ask for  yeah  you  re probably not going to get many surprises or deep meaning in this one . yet  i have always found it fairly enjoyable to watch this redneck romance . bud  travolta  and sissy  debra winger  meet at gilley  s and fall in love . they have all the difficulties you might expect a hardcore redneck couple to have . the honkeytonk scenes are fun with dancing  mechanical bull riding  and  of course  the required brawls . it has a good      country soundtrack  featuring  looking for love in all the wrong places    the devil went down to georgia   and  hello texas  by my favorite jimmy buffett . break out your cowboy boots and have a boot  scootin  boogie   br    br     out of    ,1
now  for all of the cinematographical buffs out there  this film may not rank high on your list of things to see . but if you know anything about plot development  profound truth  and the intentions that this film  the series  had  you  d understand my p . o . v .  br    br   granted  the specifics of the film are renderings of the writer  who cannot be expected to know what will happen in the end . but the film is biblically accurate and justifiably  scares  viewers into thinking about what may be . i  m a christian  not due to this movie  but due to my personal decision to accept jesus as my savior . the film and potential that something similar to the circumstances portrayed therein can remarkably scare someone into thinking about their actions and decisions . it  s not some cheap attempt to scare people into believing in god  but rather  a means to get your attention .  br    br   as a christian  i know i  ll not be left behind  and thanks to movies like this  i can look beyond the superficialities of entertainment  acting  and film budgeting to appreciate the depth that the film has to offer . this is a movie you shouldn  t not only see  but feel with your heart and soul .  ,1
the house that dripped blood is the third in a series of seven amicus horror anthologies . if the monster club is included as part of the series  this would make eight movies . although  that movie is very different from the others .  br    br   i look upon the amicus anthologies with great memories as i used to love them when i was in my teens . my feelings for them today are just as strong .  br    br   i spent many years trying to track down this movie . the synopses of the stories was so appealing that i went as far as paying a substantial amount for it when i eventually found a copy . as great as though the movie is  i did feel a sense of disappointment when i finally saw it . it wasn  t quite as good as i was led to believe . whilst better than its two predecessors  it  s nowhere near as good as its four successors as i shall demonstrate .  br    br   the linking story sees john bennett as a police inspector tracking down a missing person who lives in a mysterious old house . his journey begins at the local police station where he learns the stories of previous occupants . the linking story later sees him visiting the estate agent who sold the house . whilst this linking story seems enticing on paper  it is flat and lifeless in practice and easily the weakest of any amicus anthology . i couldn  t help but get the feeling that john bennett is a poor man  s version of donald pleasance or ian hendry . i would much rather have seen one of the two aforementioned actors in his role . we could have even had both here  one as the police inspector and another as the estate agent . they could  and i believe would  have brought this weak element of the movie to life much better .  br    br   the movie contains four stories  each of which focuses on an inhabitant of the house .  br    br   the first story sees denholm elliott as a writer of crime stories . he is absorbed into an exciting story about a strangler  even going as far as drawing a sketch to aid his writing . soon after  he begins seeing visions of his own creation . some excellent direction by peter duffell  particularly with the choice of camera angles helps to detract from the restrained script . elliott  s performance is superb as the tormented writer and he also helps to elevate the story . the story ends with a semi  twist but i couldn  t help get the sense of a script which didn  t allow it to live up to its potential .  br    br   the second story sees peter cushing move into the house . he is a lonely man who is still pining for a beautiful young woman who once jilted him and who he keeps a picture of . cushing  s performance really brings this emotionally  moving story to life . he is helped by the director who chooses to include continual focus on cushing  s loneliness . this is taken further with a great hallucination scene that helps us to see inside cushing  s mind . anyway  cushing sees a figure at a nearby wax museum that looks just like his girl . naturally his obsession grows but this seemingly romantic story has a disturbing twist at the end . joss ackland plays cushing  s rival but his performance is massively overshadowed by the late great peter cushing .  br    br   the third story and easily the best sees christopher lee  my favourite horror actor of all time  move into the house with his daughter . mr . lee gives one his perfect ice cold performances here . he shows no love or attention for his daughter at all . he even brings in a school governess to educate her . the governess  played by nyree dawn porter in another of her superb performances  tries to find out what is wrong . without giving too much away  i can reveal that witchcraft plays a role . christopher lee  s presence is truly electrifying in every scene he  s in . chloe franks deserves special recognition for her massively underrated performance as the little girl who is easily the creepiest character in the whole movie . the movie is worth seeing even for the sake of seeing just this one story .  br    br   the final story is played almost entirely for laughs but it certainly does entertain and that  s what matters . jon pertwee plays a horror movie actor who moves into the house . he is very dissatisfied at the approach his producers take to movies  seeing everything as cheap and fake  particularly the costumes . so he decides to buy an authentic cloak for his latest vampire role . geoffrey bayldon has an excellent cameo as a dealer who sells pertwee an ancient cloak . when pertwee puts the cloak on  he starts developing fangs and basically transforming into a vampire . pertwee  s performance has to be seen to be believed . it truly is hilarious . ingrid pitt is also in this story but her talent is wasted in a role that should have been much larger .  br    br   the linking story finishes with a loose connection to the final story . this is particularly fitting since the inspector was looking for pertwee and naturally decides to visit the house . the rest you  ll be able to work out for yourself . as weak as the linking story is  it does have a decent if somewhat unintentionally comical ending .  br    br   i  m convinced that the blame for the shortcomings in what should have been a truly magnificent movie doesn  t lie with peter duffell  the director  who really does his best with what he  s got . i think the script was just too restrained and lacking the ambition that can be found in the four later movies .  br    br   overall  the house that dripped blood  despite its flaws is a must  see for fans of the amicus anthologies  fans of other amicus movies or fans of portmanteau horror movies . if my summary provides the movie with enough appeal in your eyes  check it out . you  ll enjoy it   ,1
who in their right mind plays a lyrical song at the same time they are portraying an emotional scene between two people  when flipper confronts his wronged wife in the dressing room  the song sung with lyrical content is as loud as the dialog  so one can hear neither  diluting any emotional impact the scene may have had . the scenes of annabella getting beaten by her father with his fists  a lamp and then a belt was so cartoonish as to be absurd . this entire movie is a cartoon  the rampant prejudice against whites is literally astounding . the discussion by the black women after flipper  s wife finds out he has cheated on her with a white woman  as if it were a discussion by an oxford debating team  is ridiculous . the rampant racism might be possible to endure  but the soundtrack and the sound mixing during this  movie  is too much . it was a technically poorly made movie . there is no understanding of the basic craft of movie making  the sound track  the editing and the desperate attempt of great actors trying to keep this movie afloat . i actually felt sorry for anthony quinn  wondering why he had accepted a role in this flick  his appearance in this is painful . this is the first movie i have seen by this director and it will be my last .  ,0
i  m not sure what hk movies the other reviewers have been watching  but enter the eagles is nowhere near the top of the heap in hk action . michael  fitz  wong should be glad he can get acting jobs in hk  because he couldn  t act his way out of a wet paper bag in english . shannon lee looks good and is a fantastic fighter  even better with the leg fighting than her dad   but her acting skills are also sub  par . in fact  all the english dialog     of the movie   even more than in gen  y cops  is so bad that i switched to mandarin audio just to spare myself the misery of the bad dialog delivery and the redundancy of the english subs . sure  there are some decent gunfights  but nothing we haven  t already seen before  and good cinematography  but the cheesy visual effects really spoil the action .  br    br   that said  it  s worth the price of admission to watch shannon and benny  the jet  urquidez go at it . spectacular  and almost worth watching the rest of the movie for .  br    br   finally  you might notice some scenes that seem  familiar  to you  notably a shootout at an outdoor market  think matrix  and fitz diving out of a helicopter wearing black fatigues  think mi   . guess someone thought at least a few things in this flick were worth ripping off .  ,0
the only good thing about this unfunny dreck is that i didn  t have to pay for it . i saw it for free at college . and if a college student can  t find humor in something that was free  it  s hopeless .  br    br   stale acting and poor jokes cannot be masked by an excellent  yet bewildering set design  that goes out of its way to market volkswagon beetles  . i don  t know what michaels myers was doing in this movie  but i have never seen anything more depressing . this was nothing more than a blatant effort to capitalize on the previous success of the grinch  which has its opponents  but i enjoyed it very much  . it  s difficult not to sit through this failure and wonder what better projects were passed over to fund it .  br    br   you want a funny seuss adaptation  go with the grinch .  ,0
one wonders why this picture was made at all  the plot as such is totally unbelievable if not ridiculous  the characters  experienced loner cop versus younger one  quite fascinated  quite predictable  the ending totally murky and impossible to understand  maybe after several viewings but you  d have to have a masochistic tendency for that  the idea being you have to read the book to understand fully what it  s all about  and the acting is bad . was the basic idea to show that french film makers are able to do as well as americans in the genre that include  seven  and  silence of the lambs   if so  it is a total failure . it was quite a success though  and has a sort of cult  status as the first french serial killer film  and  it seems  considered as a good product to export . strange .  ,0
i saw this movie a few months ago in the town which appeared as greendale in the movie  which is the only reason i went to see it . another local who was there just forwarded to me an email announcement of a repeat showing because the first had sold out and people were turned away . his editorial comment in his forward is a good summary  br    br    yuk .   br    br   unless you  re a neil young fan or live in  near  greendale   if the latter you know the real name   skip this movie . it  s mostly an ego trip for the filmmaker . it has no discernible plot  the music is merely ok  and too much of the lyrics are unintelligible making it impossible to follow what little shreds of plot there may be .  br    br   i don  t need to put in a spoiler warning because there are no surprises to give away .  br    br   i  d give this a  .      but that  s just for the amusement value of seeing the locales made into a movie . it wasn  t worth the   . i could rent a video camera and drive around  greendale  and make a better movie myself .  br    br   if you want to see a good environmental  message movie with no plot  go rent koyaanisqatsi .  ,0
 . . . but the actress playing the daughter just doesn  t come across as credible .  br    br   it doesn  t work for me when i see an actress of about   years playing the role of a    year  old . . . other commentators have suggested that this is one of the messages of this film  that children may sometimes seem more adult  like than adults  but with the casting as it is in this film  it just doesn  t work for me .  br    br   you might want to check other comments to find out what this film is actually about  because i couldn  t bear watching it to the end .  br    br   i agree that the premise for this film is beautiful though  i wish another director would try to pick up this story again .  ,0
there are movies  and there are films . movies are more often than not merely cinematic  candy   whereas films are true works of art . fraulein doktor is certainly well  placed in the latter . as most viewers  i was highly impressed with the battle scenes  but the poignancy of the portrayal of the central character is what i consider to be the most sterling quality of the film . having done everything possible to serve her country as a true daughter of deutschland  all the while in the throes of morphine addiction  die fraulein is treated very shabbily by the german high command despite all of her efforts . the scene in which the doktor is being conveyed in the rear seat of a mercedes benz command auto  alone  desolate  and sobbing is perhaps one of the saddest yet truest depictions of a  spy  s  lot in life . only the emotional pain presented by richard burton in the spy who came in from the cold comes close . fraulein doktor is a far deeper film than one may realize upon a singular viewing . i only wish that its producers would see fit to release it on dvd so that those who have never experienced it can  and those who have seen it can again  perhaps again and again  enjoy this exceptional motion picture .  ,1
so  i know that i voted  out of   but really this deserves no more than half of a star . i hated it . it was so stupid and unrealistic  i can  t believe any of the stars signed on to make this ridiculously absurd project .  br    br   james g . and cathrine o  hara were excellent in their characters and ben affleck and christina applegate were just as good too  but the story sucked and i encourage anyone who sees this in the video store to not even bother picking it up and reading the back cover  but to just walk away . . . i don  t even want to get into what the movie is about  because it is too stupid to pontificate about .  br    br   don  t rent this  it  s horrible  horrible   ,0
i was really looking forward to seeing this film  but after watching it i was really disappointed . the best bit was when stephen king was in it . rober john berk cannot act to save his life and neither can any of the others . a few of the performances even made me laugh out loud  the film was was not as i imagined it  after reading the book which was awesome  i imagined it darker and a lot scarier . if i was stephen  i would be really mad   br    br   i don  t know why they changed the ending  i thought the ending of the book was very good . if you just found out the pie killed your daughter  you wouldn  t feed it to anyone else would you    br    br   book was so much better   ,0

although the plot was a bit sappy at times  and very rushed at the end  as if the director had run out of his alloted time and needed to hurry up and finish the story  overall it was pretty good for the made  for  backwoods  cable  tv genre .  br    br   however  the actress who played the babysitter  mariana klaveno  was very good  i hope to see more of her around in movie  land . the music was also well done  getting every possible chill out of the dah  duh  dah  duh  think  jaws   type music  based tension build  ups .  br    br   i don  t think i  d want to watch  while the children sleep  again  but if i did  it would be to focus on the performance of the talented klaveno .  ,1

  sherrybaby  is quite a painful and sordid melodrama set in jersey  the story of a young mother who is out of jail on probe after a drugs  related conviction and fights to stay clean  to find a place for herself in life and especially to win back the love of her kid daughter who is being taken care by her brother  s family . the only reason the film is to be watched is maggie gyllenhaal  an actress at the top of her career  who fits very well in the role and carries the whole film on her shoulders . this is not enough however  as the story line is too simplistic and expected  and the emotional emphasis is put on the wrong place  i kept asking myself all over the picture whether i am supposed to be sorry about the ex and maybe future drug addicted mother as the director and script  writer wanted  or about the innocent kid who is in the middle . even maggie gyllenhaal  s acting could not convince me that i should not care more about the kid .  ,0
believe it or not  this movie is worse than number three . it  s slower  the acting is worse  and the story is very weak . there isn  t a lot of good to say about this movie . even the fight scenes are more dull than number three  and i would have thought that impossible . this is a very slow   minutes . painful  in fact . i stuck it through  hoping it would get better . if you really want to see this movie  you should try to find a cheap rental of it . it is hard to find  for purchase  that is  and probably for good reason . like number three  this movie has nothing to do with the first two . it is the same in name only . anyway  the most i can give best of the bestwithout warning is      ,0
prolific and highly influential filmmaker martin scorsese examines a selection of his favorite american films grouped according to three different types of directors the director as an illusionist d . w . griffith or f . w . murnau  who created new editing techniques among other changes that made the appearance of sound and color later step forward the director as a smuggler filmmakers such as douglas sirk  samuel fuller  and mostly vincente minnelli  directors who used to disguise rebellious messages in their films and the director as iconoclast those filmmakers attacking civil observations and social hang  ups like orson welles  erich von stroheim  charles chaplin  nicholas ray  stanley kubrick  and arthur penn .  br    br   he shows us how the old studio system in hollywood was  though oppressive  the way in which film directors found themselves progressing the medium because of how they were bound by political and financial limitations . during his clips from the movies he shows us  we not only discover films we  ve never seen before that pique our interest but we also are made to see what he sees . he evaluate his stylistic sensibilities along with the directors of the sequences themselves .  br    br   the idea of a film canon has been reputed as snobbish  hence some movie fans and critics favor to just make  lists .  however  canon merely denotes  the best  and supporters of film canon argue that it is a valuable activity to identify and experience a select compilation of the  best  films  a lot like a greatest hits tape  if just as a beginning direction for film students . all in all  one  s experience has shown that all writing about film  including reviews  function to construct a film canon . some film canons can definitely be elitist  but others can be  populist .  as an example  the internet movie database  s top    movies list includes many films included on several  elitist  film canons but also features recent hollywood blockbusters at which many film  elitists  scoff  like the dark knight  which presently mingles in the top ten amidst the first two godfather films  schindler  s list and one flew over the cuckoo  s nest  and the fluctuation of similar productions further down such as iron man  sin city  die hard  the terminator and kill bill vol .  . writer scorsese  s taxi driver paul schrader has straightforwardly referred to his canon as  elitist  and contends that this is positive .  br    br   scorsese is never particularly vocal at all about his social and political ideologies  but when we see this intense and admittedly obsessive history lesson on the birth and growth of american cinema in both ideological realms  we see that there is really no particular virtue in either elitism or populism . elitism concentrates all attention  recognition and thus power on those deemed outstanding . that discrimination could easily lead to self  indulgence much in the vein of the condescending work of jean  luc godard or the overrationalization of the production practices of a filmmaker like michael haneke . yet populism invokes a belief of representative freedom as being only the assertion of the people  s will . as has been previously asserted about the all  encompassing misconceptions the people have about cinema  populism could be the end of the potential power and impact of cinema . one can only continue seeing films  because it is a vital social and metaphysical practice . and that  s what martin scorsese spends nearly four hours here trying to tell us  something which can  t be told without being seen first  hand .  ,1
this movie is very very very poor . i have seen better movies .  br    br   there was a bit of tension but not much to make you jump out of your chair . it begins slowly with the building of tension . which is not a success . at least if you ask me . though at some points or moments i must say it was a bit funny when people got shot and how they went down .  br    br   they should had made it something like scary movie  then it might be a better movie . because i watched only pieces of the movie by skipping scenes and it got to boring through out the movie . i must say that i felt sleepy watching this movie so i sure can say it is not worth it .  br    br   don  t waste time on even thinking to do something with this movie besides leaving it where it already is . somewhere very dusty . .  ,0
there is no doubt that halloween is by far one of the best films ever not only in its genre but also outside . i love the films creepy atmosphere like the whole it could happen here sort of situation makes it scary to think about . also to imagine if you were ever in this situation what would you do . this is a movie that i enjoy watching highly  especially around halloween time . john carpenter is a very professional directer i love a lot of his other films  but there is no doubt that his best known movie is the film halloween . oh and if your thinking about watching the rob zombie remake don  t . it is pure crap and a true halloween fan would like the     john carpenter version better . michael myers is one of the coolest slasher killers in any film  and is a very well known one . so by all means go see this masterpiece you will really like it .  ,1
this is a very entertaining film which follows the rehearsal process of a ny production of macbeth . although it has a lot to say about power  jealousy and ambition  the themes of macbeth  in our modern world  the film works best when it is not taking itself too seriously . recognizable actors such as john glover  gloria reubens and david lansbury do nice jobs in the main roles  but the highlight for me was the hilarious scene where the  murder  of banquo  john elsen  is rehearsed . probably a more entertaining film for those involved in theatre  but anyone who enjoys shakespeare should enjoy this film .  ,1
errol flynn is  gentleman jim  in this     film about boxer jim corbett  known as the man who beat john l . sullivan . directed with a light hand by flynn  s good friend  raoul walsh  the film also stars alexis smith  jack carson  alan hale sr .  william frawley and ward bond . flynn plays an ambitious  egotistical young man who has a natural talent for boxing and is sponsored by the exclusive olympic club in san francisco in the late     s . though good  natured  the fact that he is a  shanty irishman  and a social climber builds resentment in olympic club members most of them can  t wait to see him lose a fight  and they bet against him . despite this  he rises to fame  even working as an actor . finally he gets the chance he  s been waiting for  a match with the world champion  john l . sullivan  ward bond  . sullivan demands a        deposit to insure that corbett will appear to fight for the        purse . corbett and his manager  frawley  despair of getting the money . however  help comes in the form of a very unlikely individual .  br    br   this is a very entertaining film  and jim corbett is an excellent role for flynn  who himself was a professional fighter at one time . he has the requisite charm  good looks and athleticism for the role . alexis smith plays victoria ware  his romantic interest who insists that she hates him . in real life  she doesn  t seem to have existed corbett was married to olive lake morris from     to     .  br    br   the focus of the film is on corbett and his career rather than the history of boxing . corbett used scientific techniques and innovation and is thought of as the man who made prizefighting an art form . in the film  corbett is fleet of foot and avoids being hit by his opponents it is believed that he wore down john l . sullivan this way .  br    br   good film to catch flynn at the height of his too  short time as a superstar .  ,1

we actually watched this twice in the theater because we could not believe how bad it was the first time . maybe we  d missed something . . . nope  what  s missing was missed from the beginning of preproduction . i actually went back to robbin  s novel to see if i could find the problem  and i discovered that what i thought was funny and exciting back in the day is now just so much disconnected and fuzzy  headed junk .  br    br   so  the initial problem with the film was deciding to do it at all  and the rest of the train wreck progressed from there . absolutely nothing works  not a blessed thing . some beautiful exterior photography gets steamrolled by random camera placement in interior shots . all of the actors look at least uncomfortable  angie dickenson looks positively mortified  except for rain phoenix  who gives the impression that she is too unaware to realize how awful her performance really is . the dialog is one  long  unwavering cringe . scenes don  t make sense from second to second  and the connections between them are nonexistent . and yet  the movie stumbles blindly on  convinced that it is saying something profound .  br    br   this is too bad to even be funny it is simply excruciating . gus van zant has done other good  to  great movies which i encourage you to see  and i  m happy he survived  and appears to have learned from  this mess .  ,0
a group of friends decide to take a camping trip into the desert  and find themselves stalked and murdered by a mysterious killer in a black pick  up truck .  mirage  is obviously inspired by spielberg  s  duel  and craven  s  the hills have eyes  . still this slasher yarn offers plenty of nasty violence and gore . the film  s gory highlight is a sequence involving a man having his arm and leg chained together around a tree and then having his limbs dismembered when the chain is pulled by a truck . there is also a little bit of suspense and some exciting stalk  and  slash sequences . the acting is pretty lame and the script is quite weak  but the film is fast  paced and shocking . b . g . steers who plays the villain is fairly threatening . the desert locations provide some atmosphere and the gore is rather strong . overall  if you like low  budget horror films give this one a look .  out of   .  ,1

well . . . tremors i  the original started off in     and i found the movie quite enjoyable to watch . however  they proceeded to make tremors ii and iii . trust me  those movies started going downhill right after they finished the first one  i mean  ass blasters    now  only god himself is capable of answering the question  why in gods name would they create another one of these dumpster dives of a movie   tremors iv cannot be considered a bad movie  in fact it cannot be even considered an epitome of a bad movie  for it lives up to more than that . as i attempted to sit though it  i noticed that my eyes started to bleed  and i hoped profusely that the little girl from the ring would crawl through the tv and kill me . did they really think that dressing the people who had stared in the other movies up as though they we  re from the wild west would make the movie  with the exact same occurrences  any better  honestly  i would never suggest buying this movie  i mean  there are cheaper ways to find things that burn well .  ,0
sky captain is possibly the best awful movie i  ve seen in a long while . rife with amazing cg and special effects  studded with an a  list cast  jude law  gwyneth paltrow  angelina jolie and the infinitely likable giovanni ribisi  and racing along with an overused but indiana jones  esquire storyline  this should have been a great movie to watch .  br    br    should have  being the key term here  of course .  br    br   jude law plays joe the sky captain with a dashing accent and plenty of over  the  shoulder  heart  melting smirks  but you can  t make something out of nothing  and even his flippant deliveries and boyish good looks can  t save the movie  s stone dialogue .  if he had slapped giovanni ribisi on the back and said   good boy  dex   just one more time  i might have barfed all over the guy in front of me .  gwyneth paltrow  as polly perkins  is nothing less than nerve grating . her nasal whining and not  quite  sarcastic comments get old in the first ten minutes of the movie . perhaps she put too much effort into playing the stereotypical    s comic book heroine  who knows  i expected more from her . an example of how a similar character was played  and played well  is in the late    s flick  the phantom   starring kristy swanson and billy zane . rent the movie and you  ll know what i mean .  br    br   giovanni ribisi and angelina jolie were the saving graces in the film .  angelina jolie was incredibly hot in that eyepatch . i  ll admit it .  in just a few short scenes  both actors somehow managed to rise above the tired material and deliver a more riveting performance than their dry  two  dimensional castmates .  br    br   the plot and steady story progression were old  boring  and basically just a monotonous combination of every good scene from an action movie in the past thirty years . the pace is rapid  fire in the first half of the movie  and a snail  s pace in the second  giving the audience enough time not only to guess the eventual conclusion of the film  but to figure out who the key villain is as well . the pairing is rather clichd  also  polly perkins and sky captain apparently reunite after several years of separation from a bitterly  ended romance  and their story isn  t so much charming and eclectic as it is annoying and mismatched . when they finally come to terms with their mutual feelings towards the end of the film  nobody  s surprised  and nobody really cares either .  br    br   props to the director for appreciating bai ling enough to dress her in skintight vinyl for the entirety of the film  and also for the intriguing sepia tones that served as coloration throughout . but sky captain  despite having all the essential elements of being a great movie  falls flat on its face . not even worth the   .   i paid to get into the theater .  ,0

i saw this a couple of nights back  not expecting too much and unsurprisingly it didn  t deliver anything too exciting . the plot set up of a crew of vampire hunters  v  san  for vampire sanitation   going around in their spaceship periodically killing space vamps and rescuing people  is quite sound and had the film been handled better it might well have been something quite ace . unfortunately after a fairly decent opening the sense of actual quality starts to drain away from the film  leaving something behind that  though vacantly watchable  is quite laughably bad . i don  t expect anything too special from these films that pop up on the sci fi channel and at least this wasn  t one of their creature features with an atrocious cgi beast shambling about  but it was still pretty bad  mostly due to the writing and acting  but with a sterling contribution to the overall badness made by the horrible music . when the film opted just for a typical science fiction sounding weird noises approach to the soundtrack it did ok  but all too often hilariously bad soft rock intruded and pitched scenes into silliness . i would have tolerated the general cheesy acting and writing more were it not for the choice of music  which was a serious miscalculation  turning things from cheesy to lamely comical . of the acting  dominic zamprogna was ok but bland as the nominal hero  whilst leanne adachi was pretty irritating as the tough girl of the vamp busting team and aaron pearl played another member who wasn  t well written or interesting enough to make an impression . though she didn  t seem that good at the acting lark natassia malte did well through having a less irritating character than the others  and the fact that she is seriously nice to look at . the only serious name in the cast is michael ironside and he is underused though he does nicely  pretty amusing in a manner one suspects was intentional . he seems to have fun and earn his paycheck and his role is entertaining . the effects are ok on the whole  they are at least of the standards of the average science fiction tv show  and there are also a few scenes of blood splatter and a bit of fun gore as well . things move along nicely  and i almost feel harsh rating this film badly  but then i remember bursting into laughter at regular intervals and realising that unless the film is an intentional comedy  which i don  t think it is  then it simply doesn  t succeed . too much is lame  daft  unconvincing  its an ok effort i guess but it didn  t appeal to me . only give it a go if you really dig sci fi trash or unintended chuckles i  d say .  ,0
well  finally got to see the remake last night in london  unintentionally hilarious  sexless and devoid of any real humour . i don  t really know where to start  whilst i was entertained by this strange homage  it didn  t really move me . the acting is screamingly hammy  there is no original music  the costumes are far too  disney  there is a ridiculous  six months later  insert after the burning of nic cage  which didn  t come soon enough for my liking  the bit with cage in the bear suit had the audience suppressing mirth as did the comedy punching out of various  baddies  on the island . it  s such a weird remake that i cant quite believe i saw it  it reminded me of something that the comic strip presents would have done in the eighties  a bit like their hollywood interpretation of the miner  s strike  very strange   ,0
i borrowed  slightly modified  title from some other comment . i have to say  that as i usually don  t like relationship series  i really did liked this one . great characters  interesting and not clich story  good acting  good and again not clich  which in case of dialogs is rather rare  dialogs . . . it is really interesting  how the characters cross paths with each other  and sometimes knowingly  sometimes more or less at random influence each others lives . but unfortunately  as we say in our country  do you know how do you recognize a good us series  it is the one that got canceled before the end of the first season . sure  it isn  t always true  but . . .  ,1
as a girl  hinako moved away from her small village to tokyo  leaving behind her two best friends  fumiya and sayori . she returns as a young woman  surprised to find that sayori died when she was a teenager . she reunites with fumiya and they are horrified to learn that sayori is mysteriously being resurrected via the island of shikoku . oh boy . i rented this because i like asian horror and i think chiaki kuriyama a nifty actress . unfortunately  if i had to describe shikoku in one word  it would be  fruity .  this movie is silly  boring  poorly filmed  unimaginative  and most of all  unscary . kuriyama has minimal screen time as the resurrected sayori  and her character is given little to work with .  ,0
shakespeare  s plays have a way of transcending time . the language somehow breaks the time barrier . but perhaps it is the actors who really do that .  br    br   after the disappointment in romeo and juliet  the version with claire danes and leonardo dicaprio   was hesitant take on another modern rendition of shakespeare . to my surprise othello was great   br    br   iago  s character was played so well by the kenneth fellow  even thoough iago is really evil and despicable  the character was played so well that it does what shakespeare intended for the charater to be  a pleasure for the audience to hate . i have to say that fishburne  s performance here was really good as well .  br    br   i recommend this for shakespeare scholars and lazy students  who refuse to read the book  alike .  ,1

the film did not do well at the box office .  br    br   i saw it in a sneak preview .  br    br   i have always enjoyed the film .  br    br   i live in  of the cities mentioned in the film where past players moved to .  br    br   not the best film ever put to screen  but enjoyable .  br    br   robin did well with his role .  br    br   best line of the film at the beginning  by robin  s character jack  i was that sob   cleaned up here as not to offend anyone .  br    br   was glad when it came to dvd a few years back in the wide screen  letter box format .  br    br   i am not a football fan or a real sports fan . but  you do not need to be one to like this film .  ,1
  who loves the sun  works its way through some prickly subject matter with enough wit and grace to keep the story not only engaging  but often hilarious . it  s been a while since i  ve found such a thoroughly touching  thoroughly enjoyable film .  br    br   the film is gorgeous  drawing the eye with beautiful scenery and tranquil landscapes . the peaceful imagery contrasts wonderfully with the tension between the very human  very flawed  and yet very likable characters . due to the excellent cast all five of the major players are wonderfully interesting and dynamic .  br    br   i recommend  who loves the sun .  it  s a really funny movie that takes a poignant look at the hurts that we can inflict on each other  and the amazingly difficult but equally rewarding process of forgiveness .  ,1
this was a terrible film . there was no story line whatsoever . to top it all off  when they couldn  t explain the blood and gore  the only good part  . . . they threw in a few aliens  i hate when directors  or whatever  run out of ideas and then blame the aliens  watch this film if you like . but don  t say i didn  t warn you . two things how could vinny say  welcome  when he didn  t have a tongue  its a pity mr jones didn  t have a bigger role . second thing that bugged me  why were we shown vinny jones  boils and him cutting them off and putting them into blue liquid  then these have no further role . why not  i don  t like to be shown something and that has nothing to do with the story line whatsoever . in short . bad story . i wouldn  t waste my time  wish i  d have watched mirrors instead .  ,0
  br    br   in      after a five year absence  kurosawa made what would be his first film in color . dodes  ka  den is a film that centers around many intertwining stories that go on in a small tokyo slum .  br    br   the title comes from the sound a mentally retarded boy makes as he imagines he is operating a train . we slowly get to know more of the people in the small community  the two drunks who trade wives because they are not happy with the ones they have . the old man who is the center of the town who helps out a burglar that tries to rob him . the very poor father and son that cannot ever afford a house  so they imagine one up of their own . by the end of the film  the stories all come full circle  some turn out happy  others sad .  br    br   since this was kurosawa  s first color film you can see that he uses it to his advantage and it shows . maybe too much . this movie goes in many different directions and it  s hard to settle down and get into it . but don  t get me wrong  dodes  ka  den may not be kurosawa  s best  but coming from the greatest director of all time  it  s much better than    of today  s films .  ,1
i am a kung fu fan  but not a woo fan . i have no interest in gangster movies filled with over  the  top gun  play . now  martial arts that  s beautiful  and john woo surprised me here by producing a highly entertaining kung fu movie  which almost has too much fighting  if such a thing is possible  this is good stuff .  br    br   many of the fight scenes are very good  and some of them are less good   and the main characters are amusing and likable . the bad guys are a bit too unbelievably evil  but entertaining none the less . you gotta see the sleeping wizard   he can only fight when he  s asleep  it  s hysterical   br    br   upon repeated viewings  however  last hurrah for chivalry can tend to get a little boring and long  winded  also especially because many of the fight scenes are actually not that good . hence  i rate it  only  a  out of   . but it really is almost an    .  br    br   all in all one of the better kung fu movies  made smack  dab in the heart of kung fu cinema  s prime . all the really good kung fu movies are from the mid  to late     ies  with some notable exceptions from the late    ies and early    ies  and early    ies  to be fair  .  ,1
pushing daisies was a wonderful show . much like dead like me and wonderfalls  you can tell was created by bryan fuller . i can understand how people who don  t have much of a love for theater  cinema  musicals and the like would be annoyed . this is not a typical television program and the fantastic is too much for some . these people seem to need some a little more linear and muted tone to keep them happy . this program explodes with color  winks at old movie scenes  hums with incredible music and talented performances . there is nothing random about the choices that are made from costume to leitmotif . the story takes many twists and turns but all very accessible because the conversations are about love  honesty  courage  loss and so many other things we face every day . the only unfortunate aspect was the ending of the show and that was rushed because pushing daisies was canceled . don  t approach this as a typical tv show . think of it as an evening at the theater  then sit back and enjoy   ,1
the plot was predictable  and fighting with guns gets old  but this is a definate movie to look at if you have a low iq and don  t really care about real movies . i would endulge in true art movies  like  clerks    something about mary    el mariachi   or  la taqueria  .  ,0

the film looks like as if the director was forced to make this movie by some gang of terrorists . it should actually be called dino crap .  br    br   there is nothing good about this movie . . even the actors are not worth a penny . don  t waste your time watching this movie . the director should be shot in the head for having the mentality to create such a bad movie . i mean isn  t he ashamed of looking at peoples faces after they have seen his movie  the dinocroc looks as if it was made in power point and pretty much cut  and  paste stuff . and its the same old story . man plays god . creates some creature . it escapes and is happy eating people . and finally a pretty girl and a guy in a sleeveless shirt has to come and kill it . bla bla . . u will figure out the plot in the first  minutes of the movie  ,0
hamlet is by far my favorite of all of shakespeare  s works . branaugh is one heck of an actor . his portrayal of this was just amazing . his soliloquies were breathtaking . for as long as it was it is rare for a film to hold my interest  however i was engrossed in this particular piece . i recommend this to anyone both fan of shakespeare and those not so much . this has everything the modern world looks for in its films murder  betrayal  and deceit . not to knock mel gibson  s version  but branaughs touches the whole work . this leaves no stone unturned . when you finish the film it will feel as if you read the play yourself . um how you say  two thumbs up  .  ,1
i suppose i always felt that hotel du nord was studio  bound  the movement of people cars and camera were just too effortlessly smooth and stagey to have been filmed on location . but no problem  it  s still a much underrated lovely composition from marcel carne . the plot seems a bit choppy at times  as if they were making it up as they went along  but because it is unpredictable holds the attention to the bitter end . the money shots when the  lovers are alone in their room are saddled with some rather stilted dialogue  but it  s all so lovely to fall into any inanity can be accepted . are these  young people symbols of a cancerous hopelessness in pre  war france or simply idiots  suicide pacts are fairly common if the suicidees are young and healthy with their lives before them untrammelled would you think anything other than that they were just misguided fools   br    br   arletty played the part of prostitute well  she kept that zipper on her dress busy throughout anyway  i  ve only seen a few films with jouvet  he is the most impressive invention as pimp in hdn  my trouble is shallow every time i see his face i think of sonnie hale in evergreen   br    br   a remarkably atmospheric  well acted and photographed film with so much happening it needs a few viewings to get it all in place . annabella and aumont made an exceptionally beautiful couple francois  heurtebise  perier in his  nd film had a small amusing part as a gay man . all in all wonderful .  ,1
when paris is burning came out  i totally dismissed it . i was not into the whole madonna and vogueing phenomenon . i thought it was going to be campy and silly . how wrong i was about this movie . i watched it after the movie had been out for ten years and i ran out and bought it . it took me back to a time and place of fun and excitement . i felt as though i knew all of the characters personally . the   s were spectacular and the movie captured the essence of the gay culture . what a terrific job  i went on the internet and found out what some of the original casts members were doing now but i have not been able to locate all of them . if any one has any information on any of the casts members please let me know .  br    br   i hope they make another documentary . i loved it  ,1
in      i liked it . then it became very stupid . it suggests that kids are brainless . it insults children . cartoon network used to be great . one of the shows i liked was hamtaro . it did manage to be interesting and imaginative in its approach to children programming . the show  foster  s home for imaginary friends  is like putting   spoons of sugar in your sprite . it seems as if today  s television producers are only interested in making money  rather than engaging the imaginations of children and making money  lately  my children are tuning in to the old shows     s  to find something interesting to watch . perhaps  in the absence of originality  for television to look to its past and recycle children  s programing from days gone by .  ,0

don  t even ask me why i watched this  the only excuse i can come up with that i was sick with bronchitis and too weak to change the channel .   it  s too terrible for words  the movie that is  not the bronchitis . the acting is deplorable  richard grieco hams it up as a trigger  happy  gun  slinging serial killer with a penchant for knocking off cops . nick mancuso phones in a performance as the cop on his trail and nancy allen manages to put in the only sympathetic role in the entire film . the script is dismal  peppered with clichd lines   are you ready  pardner   purrs richard grieco to every single one of his victims . dire . avoid .  ,0
who made this film  i love this film  somebody has a wacky sense of humor . . .  br    br   this zany  surreal style of film making is appealing  but it is hard to create  or easy to forget  that substance  and characters who actually have souls  are what give such a film depth . without that a comedy is just a bunch of ideas . who cares . it may get laughs  but it goes through you like a half  good hamburger . . . next . . .  br    br   crosseyed may not intend to change anybody  s life  but i appreciate the depth and substance . they sneak up on you . i started this film thinking  oh  i get it  indie comedy  off the wall  gonzo . . . yup .  and it is that  but if you pay attention there is sub text and character moments filling it out . in this sense the film breathes . it makes propositions that give pause  if you  re available to see them  and then  of course  it goes on its insanely merry way .  br    br   you will miss the point if you don  t sign the contract to suspend belief at moments in the film . stepping between reality and surreality is one of the points of this movie .  br    br   crosseyed isn  t perfect  but smart people made it . i want more .  br    br   the dining room scenes are an absolute hoot .  br    br   put on your seat belt .  ,1
cafe lumiere is a beautifully photographed nullity . unacquainted with the work of the director  i am well  acquainted with the filmmaker he is supposedly paying tribute to  ozu yasujiro . while not even approaching ozu in greatness  hou has communicated nothing of ozu  s depth of emotion and concentration on meaning within a closed space . one of the things he misses entirely is ozu  s attention to character  we are not even  introduced  by hou to his lead character  a perfect blank page  . there are no medium or close shots of his people . one of the dvd extras offers interviews with the actors and gives us precisely what hou doesn  t  a good look at their faces .  br    br   there was a great spanish film by bardem called nunca pasa nada  which translates to something like  nothing ever happens  . that would be a far better title to this pointless exercise . all through the film we are given clues about an obscure taiwanese composer some of whose work we hear on the soundtrack . but the clues  like everything else  add up to nothing . unless you  re a trainspotter  this film has nothing to recommend it .  ,0
foley  s noir quality in this saturated and intense pulp film is seemingly  perfectly  fit together . shot by shot  edit by edit  the film unfolds itself around a disturbed boxer discovering his own purpose  or lack thereof  . the other comments around perhaps indicate a lack of pulp interest  but i personally think this is a superbly put together cinematic piece   ,1

spoiler alert all throughout australia the summer turned into a deluge of rain and hail stones the size of baseballs that was causing havoc in coastal cities like sydney . it  s under these hectic conditions that tax lawyer david burton  richard chamberlain  got involved in a case  as a defense attorney  involving the death of a local aborigine who was found dead outside a sydney bar .  br    br   having five fellow aborigines arrested for billy cormans  athol compton  death it  s determined by the police coroner that billy died of drowning not by violence even though he had bruises on his neck and shoulders . yet the court decided to prosecute the five for his death charging them with manslaughter instead of murder .  br    br   david defending the five gets no help from them in their defense with the accused assailants opting to remain quite and keep what happened to billy to themselves and take what  s coming to them from the court . one of the defendants chris  david gulpili  begin to somehow invades david  s dreams as if he want  s to tell him what was really behind billy  s death .  br    br   david at first not taking his dreams of chris seriously begins to sense that their real when he meet him at the courthouse . chris confirms david  s dreams by showing him a strange looking black rock that david saw chris have in his dreams . later meeting chris and  what turns out to be an aborigine shaman  charlie  nandjiwarna amagula  who came to his house that evening david is told that he  like charlie  has spiritual powers that he inherited from his mother  s grandfather . those powers will reveal to him the future that has to do with the strange weather conditions that are flooding the australian continent . the earth  chris tells david  is going through a gigantic cleansing cycle with the old world about to be washed away and the new world ready to take it  s place .  br    br   david is confused about what both chris and charlie are telling him but as the rains continue to increase and the ocean waves start to rise he feels that something terrible is going to happen . david want  s to know if it  s all aborigine folklore or there  s some scientific facts  or logic  behind their end of world  like revelations .  br    br   by now it  s obvious that both chris and charlie are members of an aborigine tribe right in the heart of modern sydney . that alone can get chris off  as well as his four friends  for the murder of billy . since the australian government will not prosecute tribal aborigines  leaving any justice to be done by the tribes themselves . still chris refuses to admit he  s a member of a native tribe and he and his four friends are convicted of manslaughter in billy  s death with the sentences to be handed down by the judge within days .  br    br   david now determined to find out what was the reason for chris  silence  and why billy had to die  is taken by chris to the scene of the crime . it  s there that david finds out that billy betrayed chris  tribe members by going there with billy not being a member of chris  s aborigine tribe . it  s also revealed to david that he himself has some kind of spiritual connection with the austrailan aborigines as both charlie and his step  father rev . burton  david parslow  told him .  br    br   the stage is now set for the great and final cleansing cycle that david  s been seeing in both his night  time dreams and day  time visions . it comes in the form of a massive tidal wave rolling out of the pacific ocean into the australian coast city of sydney and then submerges the entire continent .  ,1
it  s not so much that spontaneous combustion had little potential . indeed the under  explored title phenomenon is quite intriguing and  for at least the opening half  this tobe hooper effort promises to entertain in a way only cheesy    s horror can . but somewhere between brad dourif  s on  again  off  again performance and the overly intricate plot  this would  be thriller loses its way .  br    br   dourif  featured here before his built  in horror fan base had accumulated  is average guy sam . of course average guys don  t stay average for long in horror movies  so after a well  done origin outline  we see sam  s various body parts start to ignite . soon he  s igniting other people  too  much to the consternation of gal pal lisa  played unmemorably by cynthia bain .  br    br   while the title of the film implies a fire  happy monster on the loose  director hooper opted to make sam an unwilling killer . this approach gives the film an added human depth it would otherwise lack  but it also prevents us from truly fearing the human flamethrower . we  re left wondering whether this would have worked better as a straight  up villain  versus  everyone effort ala nightmare on elm street .  br    br   spontaneous combustion is a pretty nominal effort when all is said and done . it will carry added appeal for dourif  s fans and those who can  t get enough     s horror  be it good  bad or in between  but only on a slow night .  ,0
i was very surprised to see that this movie had such a good rating  when i checked it on imdb after seeing it . this really is one of the worst movies i have ever seen and i have seen many bad movies . it looks like a good movie in the beginning  but when he comes into surgery i couldn  t believe how bad it got . this voice  over destroys everything  just imagine you are being cut open like that and then listen to what he says . i saw the movie in german so i don  t really know what he said in english  but ironic stuff like  yeah right  it doesn  t hurt . .   . . . what is this  telling yourself  think about something else  and then forgetting your pain by just thinking about your girlfriend is just . . . stupid . and his mother . . . how the hell does she figure something like that out  someone comes to tell her  her son died in surgery  what she kind of had to expect  . plus she found some letters in jessica albas bag . plus that  she knows the hospital  stuff . . . and then it takes her  one second  to figure it out  what the hell   and the ending . . . why does the police bust them  the patient died in surgery  thats all that happened . that drunk doctor doesn  t know anything else either . . . and then they bust them all  even the girlfriend    why    despite all that i think christensen did a bad job  but that doesn  t really count for me . . . those mistakes and stupid things i wrote about above are the problem . i watched this movie with some friends and we all were very disappointed . . . as i said  one of the worst movies i have ever seen . . . just don  t watch it    ,0
i really wanted to like this movie  but it was just imposable . the acting was ultra hammy  the plot was annoying  and the pace was slow  sooo slowwwwww . the whole time sitting in the theater i wanted the movie to end . twenty minuets into a films and i  m praying for an ending . sure some of the visuals were nice  but c  mon guys  i mean really  and for a movie about a guy tuning magical instruments there really wasn  t much music to speak of . the music there was was annoying  and boring . there were sound loud shrill sounds at times too  those were also annoying . mainly this film managed to bore me  and creep me out at the same time .  br    br   i  m glad its over . i need to go see  tideland  and wash this bad taste out of my mouth .  ,0
this film plays in the   s and is about an italian family romano  his wife rosa and their two children gigi and giancarlo emigrate from solino in italy to duisburg in the ruhr area . i like this film  because i think it is quite realistic it shows problems which many foreign families have when they come to another country they have to get used to a new culture  a new environment and this can be difficult especially if you don  t know the language . . . . it is difficult for the family but they find a way they open a restaurant which offers typical italian food  and it is named  solino   like their hometown . the film also shows different conflicts  gigi and giancarlo fall in love with the same girl  and although rosa has to work very hard  romano refuses to pay money to engage more workers  etc . etc . but stop  i don  t want to tell you how it goes on . you should watch the film yourself  it  s a nice one  i have also made a referat about it and examined scenes which show different cultural attitudes . and there are a few . . .  ,1
my super x  girlfriend is one hell of a roller coaster ride . the special effects were excellent and the costumes uma thurman wore were hubba buba . uma thurman is an underrated comedic actress but she proved everyone wrong and nailed her role as the lunatic girlfriend . she was just simply fabulous    luke wilson was also good as the average joe but he was a brave man to work with one of the greatest actresses of all time . the supporting cast was also superb especially anna faris who was extremely good  a lot better than in the scary movie franchise  .  br    br   ivan rietman did very well in directing this film because if it wasn  t for him and uma thurman this film wouldn  t have done so well . this film is clearly a      for it  s cast  uma thurman   it  s director  it  s screenplay and from it  s original plot line . this film is very highly recommended .  ,1
this movie could be used in film classes in a  how not to script a b  movie  course . there are inherent constrictions in a b  movie budgets are tight  time is precious  scarecrow was apparently shot in  days  and the actors are often green and inexperienced . the one aspect you have complete control over is writing the best script you can within the limitations set before you . scarecrow  s script seems to have been written in a drunken haze . i could go through about fifteen examples of the nonsensical scripting of this movie  but i  ll just mention one the gravedigger . the character of the gravedigger is introduced about an hour into the movie . he seemingly has no connection to any of the other characters already in the movie . he is shown with his daughter  who also has no connection to anybody else in the movie . the gravedigger is given a couple scenes to act surly in and then is killed to pad out the body count . why give the gravedigger a daughter  why give the daughter a boyfriend  why introduce them so late in the movie  why not try to make them part of the ongoing storyline  scarecrow doesn  t seem to care .  br    br   the  story  of scarecrow goes something like this lester is a high school kid  played by and actor who  d i  d peg to be in his early    s  who is picked on by the other kids . he is an artist who draws birds and has a crush on a classmate named judy . his mom is a lush and the town whore . one of her reprobate boyfriends makes fun of his drawings  by calling him a  faggot  for drawing birds instead of  monsters and cowboys .  if you have a high school student still drawing cowboys i  d think him to more likely be gay than a high school student who draws crows  and later  kills lester  in a cornfield  under the titular scarecrow . magically  lester  s soul goes into the scarecrow . somehow  this transference changes lester  s soul from that of an artist into that of a wisecracking gymnast  i know some reviews have called the scarecrow a kung  fu scarecrow . i disagree . the scarecrow practically does a whole floor routine before jumping onto the truck during the climax of the movie  . the scarecrow then goes on to kill those who tormented him  those who smoke pot in the corn field  those who dig graves  boyfriends of daughters of gravediggers  pretty much anyone who showed up on the movie set .  br    br   the bonus feature on the dvd should be mentioned . the director  a frenchman  does an impromptu version of rap music  admits he enjoys not having executives around on set so he can screw his wife while working and gives a quote to live by  and i  m paraphrasing    life ez a bitch  but et has a great ass   br    br   number of beers i drank while watching this movie  did it help no number of beers needed to enjoy this movie whatever it takes to get to blackout drunk level .  ,0
   is a film about a club with that very title in the setting of the   s era . it features the classic good  looking bartender . the sexy females . the high powered owner . the partying . when all entwined together chaos ensues  and the bartender  played by phillipe  seems to be at the brunt of it all .  br    br   i  m going to be as blunt and honest as possible  whilst avoiding any outright unfair or untrue comments  like  it  s an  ok  film  . i really do find it a completely dire film complimented by it  s dire cast . every time i sit down to watch a film casting salma hayek  i am always awaiting to see her beauty  radiantly expressed simultaneously with a great performance  but  reality invariably reminds me quite abruptly how utterly talentless she is . i mean  really  what has she ever bequeathed the masses with  other than her immense table dance in  from dusk till dawn  . . .  the same goes for ryan phillippe  another poor actor who gives nothing to the screen but his good looks and insanely dull facade otherwise known as  acting  . mike myers  isn  t quite as bad as these   he does at least give the film something worthy . playing the seedy  extroverted co  founder of the   club . the type that the majority watching would hate  i . e . job well done   he puts in a somewhat convincing performance that gave me rare enjoyment from the flick . but alas  it is not enough to rescue the film from it  s baseless and flat nothingness . most  bad  bad films i find something to take from the film  but this has nothing to it  really . neve campbell isn  t too bad  but she is just  there  . the storyline is dull  it appears the writer was more bent on making a film of this style and embellishment and forgot to add anything else . any meaning . any class . anything at all . because like most ornaments  they are just hollow pointless objects  that are merely pretty to look at  much akin to the basis of this disastrous film .  br    br   genuinely an hour and a half of time i could have spent better doing something much more exciting  like talking to   year old relatives on the phone about the weather .  ,0
i can  t believe i actually sat through the whole thing . this movie has the worst acting since killjoy .  br    br   here is a brief outline of the plot the movie starts out with jojo and that other chick sitting around on the beach  drooling over a skinny blonde  haired beach  hunk  who looks like he hasn  t been to the gym a day in his life . somehow  everyone knows him  and every single chick in the movie wants him . uh oh  here comes the competition  the stereotypical  hot chick  and her best friends  who drive an ugly pink car . we soon find out jojo  s mom got the job of a lifetime in australia  which means that jojo would have to move and leave her best friend behind  oh no  i think i  m gonna cry  . a huge storm comes  and fills their swimming pool with nasty water . somehow  for no apparent reason  the little chick falls into the pool  and comes face to face with  yup  you guessed it  a mermaid  this is where the  story  really takes off . basically  they want to get the mermaid to fall in love with the  hunk  .  br    br   this is a preteen flick with acting so bad  it makes the    s look like the pinnacle of oscar  worthy performances . this movie has all the clichs possible . . . the best friends  the  hunk  who everyone wants  the  hot  bad girl and her bitchy friends  the scary old man . . . you name it  it  s in there . i took one for a lot of people by watching this . consider my hour and   minutes a sacrifice to you . please  don  t see this movie . don  t make it so i suffered in vain .  ,0
this film was shot on location in gerard gardens in liverpool  and was the uk  s answer to films such as  blackboard jungle  . the film stands the test of time quite well  with all the moral stories still  or even more  relevant today . the film feature some fine performance from some notable british actors such as david mccallum  stanley baker  peter cushing and anne heywood . baker plays a liverpool cop assigned to juvenile liaison duties  with the premise that if you catch the kids at an early age  they will end up being responsible adults .  br    br   notable cameos in the film include freddie starr  fred fowell  and melvyn hayes  gloria  . tsai chin and michael chow play brother and sister  they are real life brother and sister  who are caught up in an arsonists web . tsai chin is still acting and can be seen in the latest nicole kidman film  the interpretor  .  br    br   violent playground features a gun siege in a school  so is unlikely to be shown on tv following similar events in scotland  russia .  br    br   i lived in gerard gardens where the film was shot  though was not born at the time   and have fond memories of the area . i have recently completed a documentary on gerard gardens which includes extracts from  violent playground   and a small uk film  coast to coast  which stars lenny henry and pete postlewaite . the tenements were demolished in     and the films go some way in keeping the memory alive .  br    br   there were some complaints from the residents when the film was released  as the film portrayed the area in a bad light . time has helped heal those wounds .  br    br   a little gem of a film  i would recommend you seek this out  ,1
ok  not possibly  honestly the worst movie i  ve ever seen .  br    br   this made absolutely no sense  there was no plot  no characterization  no acting  just nothing .  br    br   here  s what i thought when i first saw it may   th      caution  this is a spoiler alert . it  s also alot of me complaining about how bad the movie is  br    br   ok so the movie begins and the characters are introduced  but there is no character explanation . as far as i knew the main character was new to this school  but apparently not . also it appeared that he lived by himself . . . then that he was a foster kid . . . then that his mother was a raging alcoholic who lived with him still . also all his friends apparently had no parents and lived by themselves .  br    br   now we come to a main plot point  this insane guy has broken out of the insane asylum and is running rampant . now our main character is obsessed with this guy and focus  intently on him for the contingency of the movie . i think i must have missed a main plot element here  there was no reason for the main character to get hooked . even if that  s the point  having no reason  why do all his friends  who are skeptical like  minutes before  suddenly follow him and do what he wants .  br    br   so the movie continues on  and it gets all right . they  re running havoc on the school  blah blah blah . but wait a minute . . . suddenly everyone knows that the main character is running the  show  here . wait a second  didn  t the insane guy specifically tell the main character not to do that  it was supposed to be anynomous .  br    br   ah another important plot element has been skipped over . . . the insane guy was supposed to not be insane . . . everyone said he wasn  t insane . but as the story goes on  he is very clearly out of his mind . but i thought the news people said he wasn  t . . . hm . . .  br    br   now the movie comes to a close . that was the close  what the hell was that  not only did the ending not answer any questions about the main character  it didn  t answer any questions about the insane guy . are these people in the same situation  if yes  then there are some very basic story lines that do not tend to this . if no then what is the point in saying  that  s you in two weeks .     br    br   end of the thing . . .   br    br   that  s what i thought then . that is pretty much what i still think now . it  s  months down the line  and if i can get it for free  i might give it another chance  but i doubt it . i highly doubt it .  ,0
don  t read this review if you want the shocking conclusion of  the crater lake monster  to be a total surprise  br    br   a claymation plesiosaur rises from the depths of crater lake to wreak havoc on a group of local rednecks  not to mention your fast forward button . to call  the crater lake monster  amateurish is to overstate the obvious . if you aren  t a fan of low budget drive  in films  you probably wouldn  t be looking here in the first place .  br    br   the problem with the movie is that when there  s no monster action going on  it really sucks and goes nowhere . the script is very ed wood  ish  in that it  s utterly contrived in the way it sets up the main action sequences . nothing is too outlandish for  the crater lake monster  . it explains its dinosaur by having a meteor crash into crater lake   superheating  the water to the point where it incubates a dinosaur egg that has apparently been resting at the bottom of the lake for millennia . even if we could accept that the egg could have been lying there for so long and remained uncovered and viable  wouldn  t  superheating  the water to such a high temperature cause most of the lake to evaporate  other than some token fog in one or two scenes  we see no evidence of the water being hot  other than a few lines in the script .  br    br   the script is padded rather obviously in a few sequences  and it will do anything to get the characters near the lake so that they can be menaced by the claymation dino . a couple just passing through experiences car trouble and while their automobile is being serviced  they decide to rent a boat and head out into crater lake . hmmmm . . . do you think these strangers in the story could be there so they would run into our title monstrosity  in a sequence that  s just plain bizarre  a drunk robs a liquor store and decides to murder the cashier and a bystander instead of paying four dollars for a bottle of booze . a car chase ensues  and wouldn  t ya know it . . . they end up right by the lake . snack time for cratey  yeah  it  s not hard to figure out  and you  re so far ahead of the script that you  re irritated when it takes another ten minutes for these scenes to unfold .  br    br   the shamelessness of it all is endearing  and i really want to like  the crater lake monster  . i just can  t do it . there  s not enough here to go on  and this is more of a movie to put on during a party  because you could talk right over it and it wouldn  t matter .  br    br   the film has a slim list of the things going for it  the most important being the dinosaur itself  which appears in three forms a shadow puppet  a large model head that is dragged woodenly through the water  and a fully realized claymation insert that actually looks pretty good . there are also a pair of lovable hicks in it  and they carry the majority of the intentional humor in the movie . a downbeat ending leaves us mourning the death of both the monster and one of our beloved hicks  so every good thing about this film is dead by the end of it . why was i so affected by this conclusion  was it the mournful song played over the closing credits  or was i just weeping inwardly for the time that i waste watching films like this   ,0
is there anything that happens in this movie that is not predictable  i think not . basically the movie is clich after clich and really nothing ever comes as a surprise . it makes the movie extremely predictable and because of that the movie is also seriously lacking in tension . so for a thriller it is not tense and unpredictable enough but also as a drama it  s a failure . this is because the movie its story is highly unlikely . i mean  no way this could ever happen in real life  as in the same way as the events occur in this movie . so the movie has a real suspense and credibility problem .  br    br   but it truly are the clichs that killed the movie . it was cringing stuff at times . everything is so formulaic in this movie . the predator is portrayed as a cool heartless  almost psychopath like sexual frustrated boy and the victim as a naive young woman  who acts like she didn  t see any of this coming . everything that happened in the movie was so obvious and all seemed to happen for a reason . such as the sequence in which the  predator  fixes the  victims  broken car . that has got to be one of the oldest clichs out of the book . i knew what the movie tried to achieve after that point . i tried to look as if the teacher and the student were really growing toward each other trough the eyes of the other persons around them . it was so incredibly obvious and cheap that i almost wanted to stop watching the movie after that point . the movie is filled with moments like these .  br    br   the title might suggest that this is a cheap porn movie but this in fact is a sappy made for tv movie . which means that everything is slowly happening and the movie spends halve its time on character development and unnecessary sub  plots to make the movie even more drama like .  br    br   i  ll admit that elizabeth berkley is pretty good acting in this movie . she makes some of the clichs and events look even almost realistic at times . her hollywood career is as good as over after appearing in the paul verhoeven movie  showgirls   so unfortunately she will probably only still appear in movies  and television series like this one . it  s a waste of her talent and she surely deserves better . all of the other characters are a disappointment . corey sevier plays the clich pretty  untouchable  rich boy and the way the husband of the main character is portrayed is even worse . he looks more like a sexual frustrated predator than the true predator of the movie . he basically tries to have sex with his wife in every sequence . he wakes up  he wants sex . before he goes to sleep  he wants sex . he gets home  he wants sex . it might be a realistic thing but i don  t know  it just didn  t feel right for a movie like this one and the story in general .  br    br   a clich filled movie and i can  t think of any reason why anyone should ever watch this movie . it  s predictable and therefor also lacks in suspense and credibility . not an  horrible  movie and it certainly is a watchable one at times but all the weak and clich elements in the movie also make this far from a recommendable one .  br    br        ,0
every once in a while i will rent an action  adventure film just as a way to relax and occupy my mind with nothing important . this is why i own a copy of charlie  s angels        not a quality film  but it makes me laugh and allows me to unwind for a while . one of these days i will probably buy copies of the princess bride and a few monty python movies for much the same reason .  br    br   in any case  i rented this film because i wanted to be entertained without being challenged . for the most part  i got what i wanted . the plot was something along the lines of a poorly written xena episode  and the kathy long  s acting was very community theater  not bad for a professional kick boxer and amateur actress  . there were a few high points on the part of the cyborgs . somehow they managed to get some pretty good actors to play the bad guys  unfortunately  most of them die pretty darned quick .  br    br   like most martial arts films  the further you get into the movie  the more emphasis there is on action  and the plot  which wasn  t strong to begin with  deteriorates almost as quickly as the acting . however  the more kathy long fights  the more time the director devotes to her backside . by the end of the movie i was seriously considering watching it a second time just to count the number of times kathy long  s tight red shorts were center screen .  br    br   unfortunately  there just wasn  t enough meat to this film to make satisfying curiosity worth seeing the film a second time . if you are a hard core xena fan in need of something to wile away a few hours  by all means  go to the grocery store and spend the .   cents on the rental . there are some strong similarities between the show and this movie .  br    br   just don  t expect anything more than to be mildly amused for a few hours .  br    br   unless  of course  you happen to like kathy long  s derrire . then you might want to purchase a copy .  ,0
this is one of the worst movies i  ve seen in a long time . not just the story  but the acting is shockingly bad . the dialog sounds like someone reading the news .  br    br   this is rated as comedy  drama  romance  it  s not of those things  it  s a little action  that  s it . there  s really no comedy and drama at all .  br    br   if you went to the cinema to see this i feel sorry for you . i would not recommend it at all . pretty much anything else that you choose to look at will be better . this is pretty much a action  crime movie . the actions scenes sucked  and crime story part of it was very predictable .  br    br   if you are not really interested in a good story  or good acting . and you simply want to look at a  foreign  film for the appeal of being foreign . then this might be for you .  ,0
i  ve never understood the appeal of garbo . she always comes across in her films as stuck up  not all that alluring  and that annoying voice that could have drowned out the tuba section . she was also a very limited actress  like gloria swanson far better off left in the silent era . in this her last film  her performance is very average and even unassured . she tries hard but it all comes to nothing because the script is even worse than her acting .  br    br   a would be screwball romcom that is never once believable and never gets off the ground  even though melvyn douglas manages to get airborne in the skiing scenes  which are really the only amusing thing here  .  br    br   there was potential but the script fails in almost every department  wasting every actor in it . douglas and garbo had good enough chemistry together but this one isn  t even a spot on ninotchka  which i also found to be extremely overrated .  ,0
marvelous james stewart  vera miles vehicle . what makes this historical film dealing with the fbi so good is the family element that is involved during a   year career as depicted by stewart in the film .  br    br   the film shows a history of the great investigatory agency . it deals with airplane bomb plots  killing off of indians in oklahoma for real estate gain  fighting organized crime  nazis and communists in that order . the human element is never far behind as stewart weds vera miles . they raise  children as miles  heart goes out each time stewart goes out on assignment .  br    br   look for a brief but memorable performance by murray hamilton . years later  he appeared as mr . robinson in      s  the graduate .   br    br   the film has nothing but praise for j . edgar hoover . he certainly brought the fbi up to par .  br    br   true  this could be viewed as right  wing propaganda  especially with stewart  s real  life republican views  but it  s well done  historically informative  and the view of the family so well depicted .  ,1
the final chapter in the hanzo the razor trilogy provides fitting closure for this entertaining series of samuraisploitation . inoue replaces yasuzu masumura  blind beast  red angel  manji  in the director  s chair  but the style is pretty much the same  perhaps due to shintaro katsu serving as the producer  apart from the titular antihero .  br    br   hanzo uncovers a female ghost who is guarding treasure hidden in the bottom of the lake . of course  hanzo being hanzo  he  s not put off by the fact she  s a ghost  so he proceeds to rape . . . ahem  interrogate her  using the now familiar revolving net device . the plot takes through a series of blind monks who also doubletime as loansharks  corrupt officials  promiscuous wives and the necessary hack and slash . hanzo  s superior officer  onishi  and his two servants  provide the typical comedic notes  and generally  it  s business as usual .  br    br   significantly less convoluted and easier to follow than the first  which is all over the place and a bit of a mess   less stylish  dramatic and bloody than the second  arguably the finest in the hanzo series   but still entertaining and worthwhile on its own merits . complete with trademark training sequences  the obligatory rape  swordfights  and a mystery hanzo is called upon to investigate  this will ultimately satisfy the fans .  ,1

ned kelly  ledger   the infamous australian outlaw and legend . sort of like robin hood  with a mix of billy the kid  australians love the legend of how he stood up against the english aristocratic oppression  and united the lower classes to change australia forever . the fact that the lower classes of the time were around    immigrant criminals seems to be casually skimmed around by this film . indeed  quite a few so called facts  in this film are  on reflection  a tad dubious .  br    br   i suppose the suspicions should have been aroused when  in the opening credits  it was claimed that this film is based upon the book  our sunshine  . if ever a romanticized version of truth could be seen in a name for a book  there it was . this wasn  t going to be a historical epic  but just an adaptation of one of many dubious legends of ned kelly  albeit a harsh and sporadically brutal version .  br    br   unfortunately  ned kelly is nothing more than an overblown hallmark channel real life historical drama  wannabe  the story plods along at an alarming rate  alarming because never has a film plodded so slowly   the feeling of numbness after the two hours of pure drivel brought back memories of costner  s awful wyatt earp all those years ago . simply put  nothing happens in the film  but it takes a long time getting to that nothing . this would possibly have been a tad more bearable if the performances were good  because the direction sure as heck wasn  t  . however  unless you are looking to play a game of spot the worst oirish accent  then you  re gonna be disappointed . between that  the game of who has the stupidest beard    spot the obvious backstabber    clue  they are all ginger for some reason   and nature in australia . including lions   it is an experience similar to flicking through hallmark  the history channel  discovery channel  and neighbours whilst suffering a huge hangover . yup  nature pops up a lot  as to fill even more time  possibly an attempt to look arty   the film keeps showing pointless wildlife shots  and once all the native species are shown  here  s a circus to allow for a camel and a lion  which is used during one fight to try to make us actually feel more sorry for the lion than the massacred people  .  br    br   this is a turgid  emotionless piece of historical fluff which should have gone straight to tv . there isn  t even one good word i can say about this film . even the usually fantastic rush seems embarrassed to be here . when one of the characters comments that there is only  bullets left for him and his pal  i myself was wishing i had a gun to blow any memory of this film out of my head   ,0
  i thought i  d be locked away in a padded cell and they  d throw away the key   thus is a paraphrased snatch of dialogue from  state of mind  .  br    br   one wonders in what tangled forest paula milne and her co  writer found the magic mushrooms they must have eaten  to create this feeble  whodunnit  and bring such rubbish to our screens . a padded cell should indeed be left available .  br    br   niamh cusack did her best   as did the other actors  but surely her talent deserves a better vehicle than this . the height of absurdity has been reached  and this particular  state of mind  is best buried and forgotten  and certainly not just  placed in a box and locked away in a drawer  .  ,0
  br    br   get your brewskies out and enjoy this flawed action flick . speakman  s considerable kempo skill  nice spin kicks  decent with the sticks  poor couch   is the only redeeming quality of a movie that just cries bad acting . the plot isn  t half bad just executed pretty poorly . but if you  re seeing this movie for anything other than martial arts  you  re missing the boat entirely . and for a movie that is supposed to take place in koreatown  way way too few korean actors  even extras  .  ,0
i have an awful pan  and  scan videotape of  boom    and i want to see it in all its widescreen glory . so i voted    and hope you will too . together  we can pull this movie down into the pits of cinematic dross  and hope that someone will see an opportunity for big money in releasing  boom   in its director  s cut extended version . the movie is one of my howling favoritesyou just look at the people involved  the director  the actors  the cameraman  and you say to yourself   yep  i guess you can fool some of the people for a lot of time .  producers considering the dvd release of  boom   should note that  everywhere it  s been shown  there have been sellout crowds in the theaters . but it hasn  t been up to frostbite falls yet .  ,0
i had high hopes for this film . i thought the premise interesting . i stuck through it  even though i found the acting  save helena bonham carter  unremarkable . i kept hoping my time spent would pay off  but in the end i was left me wondering why they even bothered to make this thing . maybe in george orwell  s version there is a message worth conveying . if this film accomplished anything  it has inspired me to read orwell  s classic . i find it hard to believe his tale could be as disappointing as this adaption . if the film maker  s message is  the mundane life is worth living   well then  they  ve succeeded . i would recommend this film to no one    minutes of my life wasted .  ,0

this movie surprised me  not ever having heard of hyde of gackt i was not expecting much  the reason i wanted to watch this movie was because somebody mentioned that the movie contained some serious action scenes in john woo style  normally i am very careful when this is claimed  there is only one john woo and til this day there hasn  t been one director that comes close to his brilliance when it comes to action  the fact that  moon child  would feature a vampire convinced me even more  how can you go wrong with gun blazing vampires  sounds promising and interesting  the first thing i noticed about this movie that the pace was considerably slow  it takes it  s time to set the mood  this movie contains some nice hong kong style action scenes  but  moon child  isn  t an action movie  it is a drama about friendship and loyalty  the focus is on the characters and their relation to each other  the pop singers hyde and gackt do a good job in acting and are very believable as friends  the only problem i had was with the plot  a couple of times the movie seems to skip a few years without explaining what happened and why they had to skip  examplewhen one member of the gang dies  very dramatic moment  alexander wang sees kei  hyde  drinking blood of one of the attackers  without warning and explanation the movie skips  nine years and most of the friends aren  t together anymore  also without a proper reason given son  alexander wang  and sho  gackt  have to kill each other  i know that this is done to add some serious drama  because of the actors it is very effective but sometimes it does feel forced  apart from the flaws in plot this movie has an ambiance and slickness that makes it hard not to like this movie  it is hard to explain why this movie is wonderful  but it just is  the overall experience you get is heartwarming and sincere   ,1
this is the most depressing film i have ever seen . i first saw it as a child and even thinking about it now really upsets me . i know it was set in a time when life was hard and i know these people were poor and the crops were vital . yes  i get all that . what i find hard to take is i can  t remember one single light moment in the entire film . maybe it was true to life  i don  t know . i  m quite sure the acting was top notch and the direction and quality of filming etc etc was wonderful and i know that every film can  t have a happy ending but as a family film it is dire in my opinion .  br    br   i wouldn  t recommend it to anyone who wants to be entertained by a film . i can  t stress enough how this film affected me as a child . i was talking about it recently and all the sad memories came flooding back . i think it would have all but the heartless reaching for the prozac .  ,0
the first review i saw of page  said  what is madhur bhandarkar finally wants to say   . should he say something so decisive .  br    br   the most beautiful thing about page  is it doesn  t take sides . no propaganda whatsoever . this is the film that captures so many angles of an issue  i don  t know what do i call as an  issue  here  and yet like any mediocre movie doesn  t come up with an solution . i was so intrigued when i realized that the movie ended almost in the same scenario just like it started .  br    br   the movie defines so many characters who are completely with completely different priorities and different ideologies and yet they are all a part of the system which is all the more apathetic . i wish i can say more but there would be more spoilers ahead . so watch page  if you wanna see one of the most mature films of the recent times .  ,1
what a horrible  horrible film . the worst collection of cliches i have seen in a long time . not that i saw much . i left the theatre screaming after about   minutes in search of a stiff drink to soothe my nerves . meryl streep was awful as usual . how many hurt and tortured expressions can  person have  aidan quinn  s talents were  as so often  totally wasted . and who told gloria estefan she could act  trying to be polically correct this movie still enforces racial stereotypes .  brave inexperienced lonely music teacher teaches underprivilegded kids violin in poor neighbourhood school  . the kids weren  t even cute  just written in to suit the appalling script . aaargh  wes craven really made me cringe for once . real horror this one   ,0
well here comes another  well  romantic comedy . . . but unlike all others movies of this genre  this is by far the best i have seen in a long while . .  br    br   i  ll admit  at first i wanted to watch this movie because of megan fox  and a little because of simon pegg . . .  br    br   first of all  if you have watched a decent amount of movies  you will know that sidney and alison would be together at the and of the movie  one way or another . . . but from the beginning to the end of the movie you won  t know how . . .  br    br   okay  now this movie is just made for simon pegg . i can  t see any other actor in the role of sidney  and i  m sure this would be a very weaker movie if not for pegg  s great performance .  br    br   there is a number of great gags and jokes in this movie that kept me laughing really hard  courtesy of simon pegg  s character sidney . . . but i think everyone in this movie is good . for example  kirsten dunst is really solid in this movie  i usually don  t think of her as any more than an average actress  but she was really good in this one   then there  s jeff bridges  there  s gillian anderson  and of course megan fox who plays spoiled bitchy star sophie maes . . . great role for her . . .  br    br   all in all  while i usually don  t agree with ratings her on imdb  this time i would completely agree with them . . .  br    br   go and see this movie  it is really light  hearted and positive  and i recommend it deeply . . . my rating  out of   . . . well  .  actually . . .  ,1
if you ask me the first one was really better one . look at sarah m . g .  she is real  mean  cruel girl  look at amy adams she is just little fool hanging around . she is nothing  people don  t adore her  second  sebastian was cute and hot in first movie  now he is  baby face  . story is not that good  and i do not understand . why didn  t they make this one first  it is the beginning . loosy actors  nothing with story . this is not cruel  this is playing . first one has better actors  better story  and its mean . i think that the music is better in cruel intentions  and the music is better in cruel intentions  . it is not the worst movie i saw  but in compaer with first one its one big  big  big nothing .  ,0
this film had so much promise . i was very excited about this film . in the end  it was laughable at best  painful at worst . the acting styles ran the gamut from really  really  flat  the angels  the wife and daughter  to over  animated  casper  s character  . i felt that the dialogue was just an attempt to transfer information to the audience instead of real people trying to talk to each other . pay special attention to the scene regarding  the bug  . it  s pretty much an insult to the audience  s ability to figure things out . in defense of that scene  though  it got the biggest laugh of the whole movie . i had read that they spent alot of money traveling to various overseas locations . too bad they didn  t make use of it . i didn  t feel like i was transported to exotic locations . anybody could insert stock footage of the coliseum in rome . however  to end on a positive note  i thought the sets were pretty good . i really liked the graphics that were displayed on the decoding computers . it is my opinion  and that  s all it is  that if the schmaltz factor would have been much much lower and the action factor would have been greatly increased  this film would have been good .  ,0
howling ii       was a complete    from the first film . whilst the first film was campy and creepy . the second one was sleazy and cheesy . the production values on this one are pretty bad and the acting is atrocious . the brother of the anchorwoman werewolf from part one wants to find out what happened to his sis  . the  scene  from the first film was badly re  created . a skinny plain looking woman accompanies bro   reb brown  to the old country  romania  to uncover the mystery to her sister  s murder  transformation  death . christopher lee appears and disappears over now and then as sort of a sage  guide to the two . sybil danning and her two biggest assets appear as stirba  the head werewolf of the romania . she also suffers from a bad case of morning face  ewww   br    br   bad movie . there  s nothing good about this stinker . i  m surprise philippe mora directed this picture because he  s usually a good film  maker . the film is so dark that you need a flashlight to watch it  no  not the content but the film stock itself  . to round the movie off you get a lousy  punk  performance from a damned wannabe  babel  . maybe if they forked over a couple of extra bucks they could  ve got the real deal instead of an imitation .  br    br   best to avoid unless you  re desperate or you lost the remote and you  re too lazy to change the channel .  ,0
  atlantis the lost empire  was everything the previews indicated it would be . it is not often you find that . most of the time  the previews show only the best parts and then the rest of the movie is terrible . not so with this one . i was pleased with the original plot  even though the sub  plots were not . the animation was not break through like  shrek  but it was good  none the less . the plot and the story line were well presented and there were only a few slow spots in them . this keeps you interested . i found myself enjoying this one .  atlantis  gets and keeps your attention . you also have to think a little bit  but not too much . once you think about it a little  you can figure out what needs to happen but you really don  t know for sure how it is going to happen .  br    br   the casting was also good . michael j . fox  as milo was an excellent choice . his personality fits nicely . the gruff natured commander rourke was also well chosen with james garner . his character reminded me of his performance in  maverick  which i also liked . i really liked the casting of claudia christian as helga sinclair . her ability to play a no nonsense personality makes the film more interesting . it  s just too bad she is a villain .  br    br   over all  definitely worth you while   out of    .  ,1

  and all through the house  is a special crypt episode not only because it  s from the first season  but this episode was the first one i saw  i remember as a young man being on vacation with my parents that summer in     in our hotel room in south carolina on hbo i saw this episode and i was buried to the crypt right then and forever  i had always been a fan of horror  suspense series and liked monster movies  and with this series started by hbo i again had fearful pleasure . this episode being the first one i saw is memorable for me and one of my favorites  it  s just so enjoyable with a nice twist .  and all through the house  has a nice cozy setting on a snowy christmas eve  which is a perfect way to get you relaxed for holiday chopping  well anyway you have mary ellen trainor  who by the way plays in several warner brothers works  usually small parts  as a greedy philandering wife who takes care of her hubby while waiting on some money and a new romance . only like most horror series things take a turn for the worst and bad people get what they deserve . the odds are greatly stacked when a maniac dressed as santa escapes from a local nut house  making for a late holiday chopping on christmas eve  as from the old e . c . comic lessons  you learn bad people get what they axe for  well this tale ends with a perfect holiday scream  also this tale was in the     movie and featured joan collins  this is without a doubt one of my favorites and probably one of the classic crypt episodes of all  time   ,1
i wandered into this movie after watching the    minute  borat  tonight  and left quite disappointed . i was a huge fan of wallace and gromit  and routinely go to see animated films . that being said  i found myself nodding off and at one point nearly walked out  but stayed waiting for this film to get better . never happened .  br    br   the visuals are stunning and the voice work is top notch  especially in my opinion  that of kate winslet and ian mckellen  i had to remind myself a few times the bulbous headed lizard villain was gandalf and magneto  . the problem with this movie for me is it  s one of those animated features for the add  set . it registers after the fact as one zany slapstick routine after another  weighed down by a treacle filled plot that pulls out every stop in an attempt to convey an  important message .  it looks a lot like busted oscar bait for the animated category  and considering the way it  s scoring with critics  i wouldn  t be surprised if the academy gets it wrong and offers up its hardware . but if you  re looking for an enjoyable animated feature about rats  take my advice and wait for ratatouille .  ,0
 . . . because this was simply awful .    dalamatians was funny even if formulaic  but this is nothing more than puerile drivel . the same plot except with the story excised from it the world  s most intelligent and horribly annoying macaw tim mcinnerny proving that he really can  t do comedy  everone remembers percy in blackadder but that was his high spot  it  s all been downhill since then   direction so poor that if a group of college students had made this you  d throw it in the bin and tell them to do it again  properly this time . ieuan grufford better go back to hornblower sharpish  whilst glenn close and gerard diepardieu ought to go into hiding for several years .  br    br   perhaps i could be too harsh after all i didn  t manage to sit through the whole film . it gets      only because i can  t give it  .  ,0

  br    br   entrails of a virgin is so bizarre and incomprehensible that it allows the viewer to interpret it subjectively  applying whatever meaning he wishes to its inexplicable excesses of sex and violence . if this was an intentional characteristic of the film  it would be a work of postmodern brilliance  but of course it isn  t .  br    br   without getting too much into plot summary  let  s take a quick walking tour of the events . at a secluded cabin  an orgy is in progress  which includes topless wrestling and diaper ping . a vanload of latecomers joins the orgy in progress  but they have unwittingly been followed by a monster i like to call  the muddy ninja .  this monster precedes to slay orgy participants one by one  except the proverbial virgin  if you don  t count oral sex  who receives his seed and consequently becomes so passionate with desire that she masturbates with someone  s severed hand .  br    br   finally she has her guts pulled out  and then there  s a scene which seems to imply that she  s pregnant with a baby muddy ninja . got all that  if you  re going to rent this movie  it  s best if you don  t speak japanese and don  t have any subtitles . in a season populated by boring hollywood flicks  putting this in your vcr might be the cinematic equivalent of shock therapy . it will certainly be something different .  ,0
warning review contains slight spoilers  br    br   there  s a parallel universe out there where gone in   seconds is a dark  edgy  controversial independent movie . unfortunately in this dimension gone . . . is a flashy  vacuous  testosterone  fuelled moronfest starring nicolas cage .  br    br   for reasons not really worth getting into  he and his large number of cronies have four days to steal fifty expensive cars  only one of which has an alarm . this crew consists of the guy with the funny  shaped ears who  s rumoured to be the new superman a guy who conducted electricity in the x  files an ex  professional footballer and two token black men .  br    br   their enemies are cops  rival car thieves and bilborough from cracker  his manchester accent suitably flattened and broadened for american audiences who are now used to that sort of thing since daphne in frasier . there  s also angelina jolie  who gets no character save to be a receptacle to men  s sexual desires . she and cage are supposed to be old flames  which is odd  as they never have anything approaching a normal conversation in all of the film  s overlong    m running time .  br    br   in fact  characterisation is so poor that whenever anyone has a  moment  a violin plays in the background to accentuate the  emotion  . it  s no spoiler to reveal that vinnie jones  who recreates his famous paul gasgoine  hand ball  manoeuvre and is quite menacing when silent  only gets one line not because his inability to speak is integral to the plot but because his eloquent summing up of the film  s dubious morality after appearing mute the whole way through is funny . allegedly . after he struggles through it in his  not  quite  acting  but  it  ll  do  london drawl  cage quips  i always thought you were from long island  . my ribs  as you might imagine  were well and truly tickled .  br    br   in fact humour is the most undeveloped aspect  from the tactless comedy policeman to the two token black characters . this sees the biggest aspect of hollywood take hold why is it that a black man cannot appear in a major motion picture without being constantly aware of his skin tone and endlessly refer to it  the younger man  who  like the elder  jive  talks for the whole duration  proclaims  us black people don  t like the cold . . . we  re tropical people  . he then goes on to express an urge to smoke a joint and watch roots . he is  of course  parodying the image of black people  but how funny is that  his older counterpart cannot speak without referring to himself  and thereby his colour  in third person .  my black ass  this   my black ass  that . does anyone know any black people who actually speak like that  thought not .  br    br   the film  s soundtrack is played almost non  stop and with increasing volume  some of the tracks  especially apollo     s  don  t stop the rock   so loud they  re actually more audible than the sound effects and dialogue . the surroundsound system even separates the two to such a degree that it makes them sound like two different films running together . no background music concept here  it  s the aural equivalent of trying to watch a film while someone at the back of the cinema has their stereo turned up full blast .  keep that music down  young man    br    br   this isn  t the worst film in the world and in many ways i enjoyed it . it  s just that it  s predictable  lazy and witless  with minimal effort in its construction . apparently box office expectations are considerably down for this movie . after being force  fed junk for several years it appears the general public are starting to wake up to the fact .  ,0

this is a gem of a movie not just for people who like fun and quirky premises  but who love the history and traditions of sci  fi and classic hollywood movies . each alien of the martian crew is the embodiment of a classic sci  fi character or member of hollywood royalty and it  s pure pleasure watching them bounce of each other and the residents of big bean .  ,1
we all know that countless duds have graced the   s slasher genre and often deserve nothing but our deepest disgust . maybe that  s a bit hastey but damn if  slaughter high  wasn  t terribly unoriginal  even for a slasher flick . pretty much  the plot involves a kid who experienced a carrie  like shower humiliation in high school and returns to the dilapidated building to seek out revenge on a group of former  bullies who all show up to reminisce . as you  d expect  they are killed off steadily by a masked madman on april  st by means of electrocution  burning  hanging  and chemically altered beer . i  ve got a number of problems with the plot details and settings of this movie  but considering the ending  i feel the need to discard my complaints and just say that this is a complete waste of time . ignore any thought of viewing this movie . . .  ,0
first of all my heartfelt commiserations to anyone who bought a cinema ticket in the hope of seeing a film in the same mould as the fantastic gregory  s girl and local hero but ended up leaving the theatre feeling disappointed and vaguely cheated . while it  s true that sequels are usually  bar a few notable exceptions  a mistake and exist merely to provide studio executives with an opportunity to cash in on the success of a previous film by offering us either a thinly disguised retread of the original story or a plot line so far removed from the intentions of the original that the resulting film makes no sense . in the case of gregory  s two girls  bill forsyth has the dubious honour of managing to commit both sins  on the one hand revisiting the plot of gregory  s girl  while at the same time serving up a frankly incredible and moronic storyline involving scottish arms dealers . schoolboy gregory is now a teacher at the same school where at the tender age of sixteen  he harboured a hopeless passion for the football playing dorothy . although now thirty five  gregory still harbours a hopeless passion but now for the football playing frances  also sixteen  despite the fact that music teacher  bel has made it clear that she is attracted to him . his passion for frances and his desire to impress her lead to his involvement in a scheme to expose a local arms dealer who also happens to be an old schoolfriend . there  s no point in going any further as the rest of the story is forgettable and the ending makes no real sense at all . the main problem lies with the character of gregory himself  in that there is no sign of the endearing and charming sixteen year old gregory who actively and comically pursues dorothy convinced that he would eventually win her over . at thirty five  gregory is presented to us as a rather sad and friendless creature whose life is neither active nor comic . outside of work his time is spent watching videos of noam chomsky and reading magazines about international injustices . as his friends and family from the previous film have seemingly vanished  save two pointless scenes with his younger sister  who no longer offers him advice or seems at all interested in his life  we are left confused about what it is gregory really wants  who he is and why he is the way he is . why for example is he friendless  why does he never see his father  who is clearly still alive  why has he returned to teach at the school he once attended  why is he so interested in noam chomsky and injustice  why has he become so apathetic  why is he attracted to frances  why isn  t he attracted to bel until the last twenty minutes of the film  what in heaven  s name do bel or frances see in him as he is neither drop dead gorgeous or even interesting  why does he continue to try and impress frances even after he and bel have become an item and when their association threatens to completely disrupt his life  are we really to believe that a scottish arms dealer openly selling weapons of torture to oppressive regimes could manage to evade media scrutiny but fall foul of a couple of school  kids  does gregory really think that dumping a handful of computers into the sea will change anything  to make matters worse  actor john gordon sinclair attempts to rehash his performance as the adolescent gregory right down to the facial expressions and awkward body language . unfortunately on a thirty five year old it just comes across as odd and vaguely creepy . on top of that  it  s hard to feel any sympathy for  or empathy with a teacher who has erotic dreams involving sex with one of their uniform wearing pupils while they both lie on a pile of gym mats . rather than being amusing it simply smacks of paedophilia . it  s hard to know what was going through bill forsyth  s head when he wrote this script or why he thought fans of the original film would embrace a story so completely lacking in the charm  wit and warmth that turned the first movie into a classic . i can only assume that the plan was to craft a film about a man who was refusing to grow up and commit to adult life and perhaps whose happiest memory was of being sixteen and pursuing the best looking girl in the school but who by degrees is forced to accept that a life lived in the past is no life at all . that at least could have been the basis of a film which was thematically interesting and intelligent . as it is gregory  s two girls adds up    wasted and pointless minutes saying nothing and signifying even less . gregory  s girl was responsible for launching bill forsyth  s career  here  s hoping that gregory  s two girls won  t be responsible for sinking it .  ,0
i fell in love with emily watson in breaking the waves  then grew even more fascinated by her range and adeptness in hilary and jackie . now comes this stunning portrayal of a rich girl who spurns breeding and convention in favor of mothering the tortured soul of the child of a man clearly in need of mothering . her eyes are the mirror to his soul   and what gentle and beautiful eyes they are .  br    br   those who take things literally will find marleen gorris  poetic and allegorical direction quite frustrating . romantics who are willing to go with the amazing kinetic energy is this filmed allegorical poem will be well rewarded .  ,1
french production in which leading film directors from   countries were invited to create    minute short films conveying their reflections on the events of september   .  br    br   the film segments vary widely in content and quality . two allude to u . s . complicity in terrorist acts  in chile against allende  who died on september         depicted in the segment by british director ken loach and in palestine by u . s .  backed israelis  shown in the segment from egyptian director youssef chahine  . two more recall other destructive acts  a palestinian suicide bombing in tel aviv  shot by israeli director amos gitan the japanese  holy war  against the west in ww ii  by shohei imamura  .  br    br   ironies abound in several stories . shadows that darken the new york city apartment of a grieving old man suddenly disappear as the world trade towers telescope to the ground in sean penn  s piece  bringing the man momentary joy . but in this bright light he can finally see that his wife is really gone . in mira nair  s film  based on a real incident  a missing young man  also in new york city  the son of a pakistani family  is first presumed to be a fugitive terrorist  but later he proves to a hero who sacrificed himself trying to save others in the towers .  br    br   there are poignant moments dotted throughout . loach has his exiled chilean man quote st . augustine  to the effect that hope is built of anger and courage anger at the way things are  courage to change them . imamura tells us that there is no such thing as a holy war . samira makhmalbaf shows a teacher with her very young afghan schoolchildren  exiled in iran  trying to tell them about the events that have just transpired in new york . but they are understandably more impressed with a major event in their refugee camp  where two men have fallen into a deep well  one killed  the other sustaining a broken leg . this is comprehensible tragedy on a grand scale for the  year olds .  br    br   idrissa ouedraogo  from burkina faso  creates a drama in which the son of an ailing woman spots osama bin laden in their village and gathers his buddies to help capture the fugitive terrorist  in order to get the    million u . s . reward . he tells his friends not to let any of the adults know their plans  for the older folks would merely waste the money on cars and cigarettes  while he plans to help his mother and others who are sick and destitute .  br    br   it is mexican director alejandro gonzalez inarritu  maker of  amores perros   who provides by far the most powerful and chilling segment  one that  for the most part  shows only a darkened screen with audio tape loops of chanting and voices and occasional thudding sounds . brief visual flashes gradually permit us to see bodies falling from the high floors of the towers  and it dawns on us that the thuds are these bodies hitting the ground . the sequence ends with elegiac orchestral music and a still shot  bearing a phrase first shown only in arabic  then with a translation added  does god  s light guide us or blind us    in various languages with english subtitles  grade      b  .  seen on          . if you  d like to read more of my reviews  send me a message for directions to my websites .  ,1
i watched this movie because i like nicolas cage and well  i found it strange and completely pointless . . . so i decided to poke around a little bit and got my hands on the   s copy of it . wow . what a difference . the original one was way better . i  d like you all to know it did originally actually make a statement  it  s existence did have a purpose . it was really the christian public expressing their fear of paganism . if you dig deeper into it it also makes comments on life but i don  t want to go into details  just  simply put  if you were disappointed and you  d like to know what it should look like  feel free to watch the   s version  a little dated  but a lot better .  ,0
i was initially forced to attend by my wife as she is fascinated by the royal families of britain and their history  and she won  t go to the cinema without me . although viewers shouldn  t expect to be electrified  this film is very well made and the visual aspect is second to none . in many ways it helps dispel the myth that victoria was the miserable unsmiling dumpy woman usually seen in photographs . she was a bright intelligent and according to the history of her early years  a fun loving happy young woman . her love of albert was the essence of true love  and even if you only count the number of children she bore     they must have had a passionate relationship . all of this is well borne out in the film . to this end  the cast has been well selected with both emily blunt and rupert friend giving sound performances as victoria and albert .  br    br    spoiler alert  the historical accuracy is somewhat questionable as at no time did prince albert get shot while defending victoria . there was at least one assassination attempt when they were out together  but nobody was struck by the shot  s . i also found it odd that little was done to expand on the allegedly intimate relationship between victoria  s mother and sir john conroy . it is quite likely that this relationship was the true reason for victoria  s distaste for both her mother and conroy . i also found it odd that there was an attempt to portray the relationship between victoria and lord melbourne as erring on the romantic  or at least having the potential to become romantic . he was already in his late    s when victoria came to the throne  and while marriages between older men and young women were common in that era  the movie portrays melbourne as being a dashing   something and rival to prince albert . there were apparently rivals to albert  but she could never have married even slightly below her station in life  and albert was one of only a handful who would have been acceptable in any case .  br    br   all in all i have spent worse times at the cinema  and brownie points with my wife can  t be a bad thing either .  ,1
after watergate  vietnam and the dark days of the nixon and jimmy carter eras  what the world needed was a good old  fashioned chapter  play hero taking on venomous serpents and evildoers in the america of     or the jungles of south america in a series of fantastic cliffhanging adventures . unfortunately what it got in     was doc savage  the man of bronze . perhaps the best that can be said of legendary producer george pal  s final film is that his often beautifully designed but sadly flat adaptation of kenneth robeson  s pulp  paperback novels probably had george lucas and phil kaufman leaving the theatre and saying to each other  we can do better than that   and adding a bullwhip  a battered fedora and some much needed character flaws to the mix .  br    br   a big part of the problem is that doc savage is in many ways even harder to write for than superman  explorer  adventurer  philanthropist  a scientific and intellectual genius in the bronzed bleach  blonde bulletproof muscle  bound body of a greek god  or rather the form of tv  s tarzan  ron ely  a rather dull charlton heston clone here   there  s simply nothing he can  t do and  more damagingly  nothing that can harm him . the man is the virtual incarnation of hitler  s aryan ubermensch  no surprise that the dvd is only available in germany    albeit with all  american values . and just in case there should ever be anything he  s overlooked  not that there ever is  he has not one but five sidekicks in his entourage  the  less than  fabulous five . a chemist  an electrician and even an archaeologist i can accept  and at a stretch i could possibly even go as far as to see the possible need for a construction engineer  but what kind of hero takes a criminal lawyer with him on his adventures  in reality doc  s brain trust were probably added because with the hero so tiresomely invulnerable and practically perfect in every way  even kryptonite wouldn  t put a dent in him  there needed to be someone at risk in the stories  though with the exception of paul gleason they  re all so horribly badly cast and overplayed  as are most parts in the film  you  d happily kill them all off during the opening titles . the villains fare no better  with paul wexler exuding all the menace of a geography teacher as captain seas  scott walker  no  a different one  delivering one of cinema  s worst accents  is it meant to be scottish  irish  welsh  greek  pakistani or some nationality no  one has ever heard of   while robyn hilton  s marilyn monroe  ish dumb blonde moll gives paris  no relation  a run for her money in the untalented bimbo stakes .  br    br   even with those drawbacks  this should have been much better than it is considering the various ingredients  lost tribes  a pool of gold  a dogfight with a biplane and a deadly poison that comes alive  all wrapped up in a quest to discover why doc  s father was murdered . unfortunately it  s a question of tone in the   s and   s pulp superheroes weren  t brooding figures prone to state  of  the  art action scenes and special effects but were treated as somewhat comical figures of low  budget camp fun with action scenes quickly knocked off on the cheap almost as an afterthought  the films aimed purely at the matine market you know  for kids . there have long been rumours that the original cut was more straight  faced  and certainly much of the camp value has been added in post  production  be it the colgate twinkle in doc  s eye  the comical captions identifying various fighting styles in the final dust  up with captain seas or don black  s gung  ho lyrics to john philip sousa  s patriotic marches  but plenty was in the film to begin with . after all  it  s hard to see how one of the villain  s underlings making phone calls from a giant rocking crib was ever intended as anything other than a joke that falls flat  while doc  s explanation to pamela hensley of why he never dates girls could be a scene written for adam west  s batman . instead  the funniest moments are usually purely unintentional  such as doc displaying his sixth sense by  er  bobbing his adam  s apple .  br    br   perhaps an even bigger problem is that  while promising on paper  the action is handled in an almost relentlessly mundane fashion  be it chasing a native assassin on the rooftops of new york skyscrapers or escaping from a yacht full of bad guys . even the winning notion of animated glowing green snakes swirling through the air as they poison their victims fails to raise any enthusiasm from director michael anderson having demonstrated their own invulnerability a couple of scenes earlier  doc manages to dispatch them with no more than a chair and an electric fan by simply pulling the curtains on them .  br    br   still  aside from doc  s various vehicles all stamped with his logo and looking more moulded plastic than bronze  the production design is often rather handsome even if it is very obviously l . a . standing in for new york while fred koenekamp  s cinematography ensures the film often looks good despite the low budget . and it  s good to see a superhero movie that doesn  t spend most of its running time on an origin story  though one is left with the suspicion that doc sprang fully formed from the loins of zeus himself .  br    br   it  s a film i  d really like to like more  but it just feels like    minutes of lost opportunities . no wonder doc savage  the arch enemy of evil  the sequel so optimistically promised in the end credits  never happened .  ,0
i just watched holly along with another movie about trafficking and child sexual exploitation called trade at film by the sea international film festival . i have to say that holly blew trade out of the water .  br    br   holly is a powerful and amazing film on many different levels . from purely an artistic and cinematic perspective  it is amazing . the sound  mixing  camera angles  directing and acting are all spot on .  br    br   additionally  the way it handles the subject matter is tasteful and non  exploitative . it presents the issue of child sexual exploitation in a way that is both educational and accurate . the filmmakers paid an exquisite amount of attention to detail  truly capturing the nuances of the epidemic of child sexual exploitation and trafficking . too often when dealing with a subject matter of this kind  it is tempting to shock the audience with graphic scenes of rape  and violence . holly is able to achieve all of this without falling into that typical hollywood trend .  br    br   i  ve had the pleasure of seeing holly at two separate film festivals  once in the us and once in netherlands . i can honestly say that i have never seen audiences more moved . just listening to conversations after the screening  people are asking what they personally can do to fight child sexual exploitation .  br    br   i highly recommend it to everyone  both for its cinematic value and its subject matter .  ,1
i  ll be honest . i got this movie so i could make fun of it . i mean  come on   hood of the living dead   what other reaction could i have  the thing is  though  the movie  and its makers  decided that it wasn  t going to be made fun of . instead  it was going to try its best to be a good movie .  br    br   and you know what  it came awfully close . a little less cheese in the incidental music  a little more professionalism in the photography  the acting  the incidentals  like the props   love the best buy bag  . . . well  it  s not a classic of the zombie movie genre  but it  s still a pretty neat little movie on its own . and the acting  writing and pacing are all surprisingly better than i would have expected . there  s even some decent humor  as two of our leads debate how to decide if a dead zombie is really dead .  br    br   if you can overlook the low budget  which leaves its fingerprints in everything  alas  and the almost constant profanity  this can be a pretty fun time at the movies . no  it ain  t great . yes  it could have been better . but the makers  the actors  the crew  they all tried to make a good film  instead of a camp classic  and that counts for a lot . the line of campy zombie films is a mile long  and thank you  guys  for not adding to it .  br    br   kudos to the quiroz brothers . i  d love to see what they do next . and hey  somebody  give them a budget   ,1
the movie is a fantasy . the story line is thin but serves as the structure upon which some wonderful songs are sung and sung beautifully .  i still cannot believe that such handsome and attractive people could sing this well .  some of the dialog is wonderfully clever . the costumes made me feel as though i was watching a haute couture fashion show from     .  br    br   movies are designed to serve various purposes . this one is designed to entertain and it certainly does . if i have one negative comment it would be that nelson eddy was a little too old to be the handsome dashing count . some of the closeups made me uncomfortable . but he could still sing and sing magnificently . however  jeanette macdonald was just as dazzling as ever . she makes a spectacular angel .  br    br   this genre is well before my time  and i an new to the jeanette macdonald  nelson eddy films and related conversation . the music in this movie is beautiful . as much as i love the classic rock music which fills most modern movies  there is no question in my mind that this music is simply and clearly more memorable  more delightful  better constructed . the stars in this movie are more talented than the stars i see in the movie theaters today . and jeanette macdonald  without the benefit of beverly hills plastic surgeons  was more beautiful than the stars i see today . i am unclear as to why so many other posters are apologetic about liking this movie and more generally this group of movies . they say it is dated and try to explain why it is the way it is . and those that do not like it say that it is not very good but compared to what  i think this movie will doubtless still be entertaining people when so many other movie are long forgotten . there is just too much quality in every way in this movie for it not to be remembered and enjoyed . i recommend this movie without reservation to anyone who appreciates great talent  great beauty and great music .  ,1
i  m far from a sylvester stallone fan and i guess the only time i really appreciated his appearance was in the french movie taxi   which is an almost inexistent small role . and yet i must admit that this movie was actually not that bad  even though i feared the worst .  br    br   when gabe  stallone  fails to rescue the girlfriend of one of his friends and she plunges to her death from a     feet high mountain top  he can  t possibly force himself to keep working as a mountain ranger . for almost a year he doesn  t set a food in the reserve  but than he returns . soon after he  s back  they get an emergency call from a group of hikers who got trapped in a snow storm . at least  that  s what the rangers believe . in reality it is a group of robbers who crashed with their airplane in the mountains after their daring plan to steal cases full of money from a flying government plane failed . the cases are spread all over the reserve and they need the help of professional climbers to retrieve them . . .  br    br   this is of course not one of the most intelligent movies ever  but in its genre it  s an enjoyable one . i especially enjoyed john lithgow as the evil master mind and leader of the gang of robbers . i know him best from the tv  series   rd rock from the sun   but i enjoyed his performance in this movie as well . overall the acting is ok  it had a lot of action to offer and of course also some one  liners  but it also offered a very nice decor . this movie was filmed in a magnificent natural environment . i loved the snowy mountains and valleys  the mountain rivers and the forests . . . perhaps that  s why i give this movie a score higher than what i normally give to an action  adventure movie of this kind . i give it a  .     . if you don  t expect too much  this is an enjoyable movie .  ,1
another excellent arnold movie . this futuristic movie has great action in it  and is one of arnie  s best movies . arnold is framed as a bad guy in this movie and plays a game of death . this movie is excellent and a great sci  fi  action movie . i  ve always liked this movie and it has to be one of the greatest adventure movies of all time .   out of    perfection  ,1
i just can  t agree with the above comment  there  s lots of interesting and indeed amazing filmic imagery in this one  it has an unusual structure and moves well toward a frightening climactic sequence that is notable for it  s effective use of silence . what  s more  it explores the odd impulse of suicide in a very frank way  not pulling any punches in what it shows  yet not dwelling and over  sensationalising the subject matter . it has hints of documentary about it as well as horror and art  house cinema  and deserves a place amongst the canon of  different  horror films like the blair witch project and the original ring  both of which it predates and could well be an unacknowledged influence on  . it  s definitely worth seeing if you  re interested in the edges of horror cinema .  ,1
this could be looked at in many different ways . this movie sucks  its good or its just plain weird . the third one probably explains this movie best . it has strange themes and just has a strange plot . so who else but christopher walken would play in this no matter how bad  average or even how good it might be .  br    br   the acting was what you would expect especially out of ben stiller . jack black i have always liked so you know what you will get out of him but this is not bad . christopher walken is always off the wall . he is always enjoyable to watch no matter how bad the movie is . comedy wise it is somewhat funny . this of course meaning that it does have its moments  though very few  but can get a little over top here and there which makes me feel like the movie is just desperate for laughs but of course not in a good way .  br    br   the directing was average as well . barry levinson is a slightly overrated director and really did not do a good job here . this movie seemed that it had a lot more potential and he did not do much to reach it . just very average and did not seem like a lot of effort was put into making this film .  br    br   the writing is the key to a good comedy . obviously that means the writing here failed . at best it is below average . considering it does have its moments it was not too horrible . that is never a good thing to say about a movie though .  br    br   if not for christopher walken and it stupid ridiculous ending i would have given it a lower rating . he is always quite a character in his movies . stil this is just a whacked out strange movie with strange characters that really don  t go anywhere . not completely horrible but i would not really recommend it though because it is a very forgettable movie .  ,0
this     adaptation of somerset maugham  s novel put bette davis on the map as a movie actress . she might have won an academy award for her performance but the films was made on loan  so her studio didn  t push for her . her acting in this one doesn  t come off well by today  s standards . as the heartless waitress who jerks philip  a sensitive medical student  around and nearly ruins his life  davis is way too shrill  almost demonic . director john cromwell  who usually elicited good performances from his actresses  was perhaps overwhelmed by this one . davis is watchable  for sure  but so strident and predatory as to seem scarcely human . i imagine the character of millie as quieter  less feminine than davis  with maybe a touch of the tomboy . davis is such a strong  immediate presence that  s there  s no air of mystery to her  which makes philip  s attraction to her seem more overtly masochistic than it should be .  br    br   as philip  leslie howard is excellent . his wan  somewhat wilted good looks are perfect for this failed aesthete . nor does he impose a personal interpretation on the part  as  say  dirk bogarde might have done  which gives his work a rare clarity . he seems completely in control here  as he should be  playing a man with a rational intellect who is in the grip of irrational emotions he cannot manage or even fully satisfy  as the object of his affections moves him in ways he cannot understand . howard was a fine actor  too often cast in standard romantic parts which compelled him to fall back on charm  which he doesn  t use here .  br    br   it  s been so long since i  ve read the book i don  t feel comfortable commenting on the movie  s faithfulness to it . i think it captures the spirit of the story well enough  and that it has in howard a perfect philip carey . the sexual undercurrents are muted  and at times philip behaves so masochistically that in the absence of strong sex feelings makes one wonder about the character  s sanity  surely not mr . maugham  s intention . thanks to howard  s performance  philip remains firmly in focus  as one can see in his various responses to and yearnings for millie the extremes to which a reasonable intellect will go to understand the irrational  in himself and in others .  br    br   overall  a very good film  a little stilted at times  due to its age  it evokes london nicely  and is well acted for the most part .  ,1
i  ve bought certain films on disc even though the second rate presentation wasn  t an option . a certain company i won  t identify here has put out several pan and scan dvds   clean and sober    star     and this one  to name just three   of films i don  t think anyone wants to see in this compromised format . some discs give the viewer a choice of   x  or full screen and others are just in their theatrical release  .     ratio .  br    br   that off my chest  i  ll say  deathtrap  was a spooky and oddly enough  amusing picture . my only complaints are the tinny score  what is that f     g instrument that is usually dragged out for films set in   th century france   and dyan cannon screaming at regular intervals . couldn  t her character have been an asthmatic who grabbed for an inhaler when she was stressed  minor complaints  both . the benefits of discs include being able to fast forward to get beyond those things which you don  t like .  br    br   i never saw a staged version of  deathtrap   so having these folks in the roles sets a great impression of their careers at the time . before broadway tickets cost an arm and a leg  the theatre was more affordable to average people . now  anyone paying less than a king  s ransom to get live entertainment probably isn  t going to a hit show on the great hyped way .  br    br   michael caine and christopher reeve were both large  virile specimens in the early   s and that  s integral to how we  ll react to their profession and overall image here . they  re definitely not bookish men who can  t fight or will back down from an obstacle . the two are equally great as their criminal stubbornness becomes their ultimate  deathtrap  .  ,1
when i saw the preview for this on tv i was thinking   ok its gonna be a good werewolf movie  but it was not . it was not scary at all  acting was good  plot was horrible  the military bid was just plain stupid . i think the sci  fi channel could of done better than this piece of crap . the movie made it sound like arron was going to turn into a werewolf  instead he turned psycho and bit some doctor  s throat out . if you have read some of my other reviews on other movies  there all positive  but this one is not simply because the story was terrible . one out of   max . im sure you all were expecting some werewolf flick  but i bet you didn  t expect this . beyond loch nes was way better than this movie  heck  any movie thats on the sci  fi channel is better than this movie .  ,0
i must say this movie is a mork and mindy knock off  when watching it i got the chills  i even wet myself a little . when that korean guy with the spiders in his neck started kicking people i was like oh my lord asian people smell and suck cause they eat dogs all the time . any way back on track chuck had a somewhat terrible performance and lacked the intelligence of a regular non robotic human being . some people would compare it to his earlier days when he was a car wash analyzer and believed in the holy ghost and the ghost of christmas past . this movie is so bad i put my new born child in a box and left it in mr . norris mailbox . he can raise my kid i  m not letting him into a world where he thinks chuck norris is a karate expert ill let him see what that hack is like in real life for the rest of his life .  ,0
excellent movie  albeit slightly predictable . i have to comment on nicole kidmans acting in this movie . some of her other works haven  t shown the amazing talent this woman has  but birthday girl doesn  t suffer from this in the slightest . even without words kidmans acting shines through .  ,1
the best part of an american in paris is the lengthy ballet sequence at the end  where gene kelly and leslie caron are the living personification of several major painters . kelly has earlier been established as a pavement artist in paris  so the sequence is the logical ending to a musical bursting with life and energy  gershwin tunes  and cast members like georges guetary and oscar levant . kelly was at his best here  it  s a little different to singin  in the rain  and the effect of all the film as one topped with the ballet gives it a definite wow factor . no wonder the sequence ended  that  s entertainment  after all other mgm musical highlights had gone by   ,1
the plot is tight . the acting is flawless . the directing  script  scenery  casting are all well done . i watch this movie frequently  though i don  t know what it is about the whole thing that grabs me . see it and drop me a line if you can figure out why i like it so much .  ,1
i didn  t know the real events when i sat down to watch this  just the fact that this was based upon a true story . after the death of the kid  s father  rhonda tries to help her daughter desiree  . . . i did not know anyone actually named their offspring that  cope with the loss . this is really made for children  as is often the case with  family  flicks  with that said  go ahead and get everyone together for a viewing  though i  d keep teenagers out of it  unless you  re sure they  re gonna buy the concept   but it doesn  t downplay the sting that the death of a parent is  and it doesn  t really talk down to anyone . the plot is sufficiently interesting  and moves along well enough . acting varies  with the excellent burstyn outshining most of her fellow cast  mathis following that pretty well  and ferland and her peers  with a few exceptions  being the least convincing of the bunch  and frankly  they  re irritating then again  i  m not really in the intended audience for this thing  . the editing and cinematography are standard  and certainly not less than that . while humor is limited to a handful of amusing lines or so  the tone is not an unpleasant one . there is an intense scene or two in this . i recommend this to fans of these types of movies .      ,1
what a moving film . i have a dear friend who is in her sixties and for the past   years has told me that people don  t see her anymore  and she longs for companionship . being in my late   s i am beginning to see what she has been complaining about . you are no longer youthful  beautiful or touchable . when may says  . . . this lump of a body . . .  wow . how our bodies change and how we are told it is no longer beautiful . i love when she begins to change what she wears . . . the colorful scarf . . . no longer the frumpy wife .  br    br   it is a sad and wonderful picture at the same time . sad in that may betrays her daughter  s trust . . . beautiful in that she finds herself through the difficulty of the affair  and chooses to move on and finally have her own life . i love the character  s daring to even initiate the love affair .  br    br   mostly i love the movie because finally it is a picture that shows the intricate nature of relationships  be they familial or not . we see paula  s vulnerability  yet she will have what she wants at all costs . . .  when she tells her mum that she will have a baby for darren whether he wants one or not after her mother asks if darren even wants a child  . the movie hits the mark on the how relationships can change  and yet reveals what has been there all along  dormant . may has stifled her own creativity to raise a family . a family that she didn  t really want  but was  something you just did when she was young  . i love the scene when darren calls her an old tart  and she smiles and says  i was never called that before  . it was truly a gem of a movie .  br    br   and daniel craig . well  i just love him . i was pleasantly surprised . not only is he pleasant on the eyes  he is a real talent . what a neat role . he is much more than any    that is for sure and i look forward to seeing him in more roles of this nature . the scene where he is pleasuring may and the look he gives her is sort of a look of wonder that he has such control over this woman  and also one of pleasure of being able to give this to her . he is actually enjoying giving her pleasure . a wonderful scene . the contrast is the love scene with bruce . bruce is totally absorbed with his own pleasure . . . two completely different men .  br    br   alas . . . i wonder where is my darren   ,1
the whole point of making this film  one of the earliest and best international color releases of cinematic opera  was to make it more accessible to the masses . and it succeeded admirably in doing so . the general public would not sit still for a love story about two young exotic lovers in ancient egypt if played by the typical    pound over   tenor and soprano with the vocal equipment to sing the glorious music properly . hence the visual substitution of the beautiful principals  a young loren  handsome della marra  and a slinky ms . maxwell  who make the story much more believable  giving those not familiar with the plot or the music a better chance at being wooed into the lovely arias who otherwise might not be . altogether  an enchanting introduction to one of verdi  s great works . i remember seeing this when i was in junior high school and it certainly awakened my interest in opera  a form with which i was then not well acquainted . i still regard this film fondly and would recommend it highly to those who might appreciate the great music accompanied by better than average visuals . luciano della marra was a standout as radames  and unfortunately for audiences did not appear in any other films .  ,1
have you heard the story about the reluctant heroes who were hired by a king to slay a dragon  oh  you have  was it set in a world entirely composed of small islands floating above clouds  and did the heroes have to make dangerous leaps from one island to the next on their journey  did water flow upwards and remnants of great cities levitate on the horizon  i didn  t think so .  br    br   i stumbled onto this movie by accident and i  m really glad that i did  it  s one of the most beautiful movies i  ve ever seen . much like the pixar movies  it  s a piece of computer animated art that could only be possible in today  s world . the animators have invested thought into almost everything that appears on the screen  and this attention to detail is staggering  the scene where the mushrooms in the foreground belch green smoke whilst the characters walk obliviously in the background is one of my favourites  . the monsters are also fully realised and wonderful to watch in action .  br    br   although the plot may not be entirely unique  the movie has enough charm to make sure you keep watching . our protagonists are likable and interesting  ensuring the audience is behind their almost impossible quest to reach the end of the world and destroy the dragon which might otherwise devour everything in its path . of course  hector is the character most will fall in love with . a small blue creature with a crazy grin and a tendency to speak a mixture of nonsense and english  hector provides comedy relief in a way jar jar binks could only dream of .  br    br   in summary  i  d recommend watching the dragon hunters if you get the opportunity . watch it for the incredible animation  the breath  taking battle scenes and for a glimpse into a world that  s unlike anything else you  ve seen on a cinema or television screen . at the very least  it  s a fun way to spend an hour and a half  no matter if you  re nine or twenty  nine  which  in fact  i am    ,1
the nearest i ever came to seeing this was a clip shown at a gerard philippe exposition in paris about two years ago . i had no interest in the remake and having just caught up with the original just over half a century after it was made i can only conclude that the inept fencing was intentional  aimed at a long obsolete target . hollywood had been doing realistic sword fights since the   s when the greatest of them all  basil rathbone  crossed foils with errol flynn and others so the technique was available and so that leaves only satire . after a while you don  t notice and revel in the henri jeanson dialogue reminiscent of the prisoner of zenda  both versions . gerard philippe certainly had the presence to bring off a role like this and gina lollabrigida was probably a tad better than martine carol  the other obvious candidate at the time . the print i saw was particularly bad and at one point broke down completely so maybe a dvd version would enhance it .  ,1
i saw two movies over the weekend  one was  kaal  and the other  waqt  . both movies are made in  bollywood  but they are worlds apart . the fundamental difference is the story and the director . vipul shaw made his indelible mark with  ankhen   one of the best comedy hindi movies . his casting of the charecteres is perfect . the story apparently taken from a gujerati play is awesome  the treatment is superb with some exceptions . in bollywood when a movie is put together the first thing a bollywood director is prone to do is sign up a music director and this guy  mediocre malik in this instance  is obligated to drum up six songs to fulfill his contract . so even a good director like vipul shah has to use them to appease the finacier and the grandma  s who just cant get enough of these numbers . no music director can churn out good songs relentlessly as clearly evident in this movie . none of the songs have any melody and they are clearly intrusive to the narration of the story except the background music and the westernized version of the bharat  natyam . the duelling and role playing the father and son is good acting by bachachan and akshay kumar . his stunt scenes are clearly outstanding . a good director surrounds himself with good actors and he is willing to wait till a good story comes along as in this super movie . then we have a cheap classless tasteless producer like sharukh khan who will stoop low as to shamelessly plug and promote a trash like  kaal  to enrich himself at the cost of the betterment of art  and they surround themselves with borderline talent  and they recoup the investment before the word gets around . these are the bollywood locusts who prey on the unsuspected audience to garner  film farce  awards given by bollywood chamcha  s and most of them are in the media .  ,1
disney  and the wonderful folks at pixar of course  offer a nice  humourous story combined with the best of computer animation . i admit that maybe the  faces  of the bugs were a little more static than in  antz  and they only had four legs  in  antz  six . . .  . but backgrounds were superb and animation was breathtaking . but let this be a lesson it was not the computer who made it such a success  it was the man behind the machine  who added the nice little twists  which i missed in  antz  . some highlights were of course the  bloopers  at the end  so keep watching at the end  it  s worth it    which were highly amusing and original . the line  filmed entirely on location  was intended for the more attentive viewer .  ,1
like his early masterpiece  the elephant man  lynch proves to his detractors that he can tell a straight  simple story without losing his artistic touch . this is a true story of an elderly retired man  expertly played by richard farnsworth  who decides to ride a tractor across a few states to pay a final visit to his estranged brother who now stands at death  s door . a beautiful score from badalamenti  exquisite photography of rural life  love those aerial corn  field shots   and a sly director  s hand that reveals man  s basic humanity  this is a beautiful slice of life film . its extremely slow pace may lull some viewers to sleep  but those who stay for along for the ride will be well rewarded in the end .  ,1
flavia the heretic is an undeniable work of art and probably my number one recommendation to state that the euro  exploitation cinema is severely underrated and not to be ignored . this is an intelligent and complex film  beautifully realized and  surprise  pretty damn accurate  this is more than just meaningless sleaze or gratuitous violence and it  s about time those prudish film committees who categorize flavia as forbidden trash reckon this as well . flavia is a beautiful   th century adolescent  forced to live the life of an obedient nun in a strict convent . she refuses to accept her being inferior just because she  s female and she curses her fellow sister for being so tolerant about this . after a fruitless attempt to escape  she befriends another rebellious nun and she even guides a troop of bloodthirsty muslims into the walls of the convent .  br    br   flavia is a downright mesmerizing film  almost impossible to believe that director gianfranco mingozzi managed to make it appear so realistic and so disturbing . i challenge you to come up with a title that centers on the topic of pioneer  feminism more intensely than flavia does . several sequences are quite shocking  on the verge of nightmarish  actually  as the camera zooms in on brutal rapes  torture and mutilation . yet all this raw footage isn  t just used to satisfy perverted gorehounds  mind you . i  m strongly convinced that they  re part of the statement  flavia  is trying to communicate humanity  the catholic church in particular  historically proved itself to be a hypocrite and discriminating race and there  s no use in denying it any further . films like  flavia  the heretic  have the courage to question and openly condemn our precious ancestors and i truly admire them for it . flavia is an outstanding and fundamental exploitation film because of its substance  but it  s even brought to an higher level by the wondrous cinematography  the glorious costumes  scenery and a breathtaking musical score by nicola piovani . florinda bolkin is very convincing as the ambitious and headstrong nun but it  s mara casares who steals the show as sister agatha . she  s a man  hating and loud  mouthed nun who likes to urinate in the open field  amen  sister   ,1
well ok  i watched this movie a little over  years ago and now i pulled it out of the dusty shelf to watch it again and i must say  i actually think this movie is good . this movie caught a buzz as the bootleg i know what you did last summer   much like final stab was to scream   and well this movie isn  t that bad . i mean it had flaws and of course it would be laughable to release this in the theaters but still for a midnight popcorn flick  this movie is not half bad . it has some scares  and some really hot women i might add . plus it shows off joey lawrence  s new beefy look though obviously even that hasn  t won him any big hollywood roles either . . . . . . i feel bad for the man  he had such a career in the early and mid    s with blossom  some disney movies and the everlasting lawrence brothers show . . . . . joey lawrence was a bit player in the sitcom scene  but then like in a    degree turn  his career went south only doing low budget movies like this one .  br    br   the movie also throws you off guard in  it makes you think between the crew  there really is a secret that someone knows  to only be disappointed in the end to find out the secret . it also throws you off on who the killer is  i had an idea but still woulnd  t think the killer was who he was  but his motives combined with the secret was a huge letdown . now  had there been a secret that was let out  this movie could  ve been one of the better b rated movies . but also i am a sucker for college themes and i also in college went on spring break in a mansion sized beach house similar to the one in here so it just made me feel sentimental about this movie .  br    br   a so  so slasher flick . good for a midnight movie .  ,0
by      and after a string of solid wwii propaganda pieces  errol flynn  s hold over u . s . box office had started to decline so  in spite of the increased burden of waning looks  he embarked on a series of films pertaining to that genre which had earlier made his name the swashbuckler . the first of these was a good one actually  adventures of don juan        but it also proved to be his last big  budget hollywood starring vehicle . the rest of his sword  wielding days were spent wandering all over europe in england for kim        the master of ballantrae       and the dark avenger        in france for adventures of captain fabian       and italy for the aborted the story of william tell       and the little  seen crossed swords       . however  hollywood did beckon him one last time to his old seafaring ways  albeit for a modestly  budgeted universal picture rather than a warner brothers a  production to which he had been accustomed when at his peak  br    br   still  the glorious technicolor cinematography leaps off the screen here and  while an older and flabbier flynn may look like the pale shadow of his former self  his red  headed leading lady maureen o  hara has a field day as a tomboyish buccaneer leader who deep down craves romance and wants to be treated like a lady . anthony quinn was still a few years away from his larger  than  life starring vehicles  so here he is typically seen as the baddie  the pirate captain roc brasiliano  a role he attacks with gusto . like the black shield of falworth        a viewing of which preceded this one  against all flags takes me back to my cherished childhood days of constant tv viewing when vintage hollywood movies were the order of the day on both the local and neighboring italian channels .  br    br   for all i know  this might well have been the very first pirate movie i  ve ever seen and i cringe at the thought of today  s generation of youngsters supposedly believing that the grossly overblown pirates of the caribbean trilogy is what buccaneering is all about  as i said earlier  against all flags might not be the finest pirate yarn ever brought to the screen but it  s a solid example of this prolific genre all the same . nowadays  the amorous persistence of the child  like indian princess  alice kelley  towards her pirate captor flynn may strike one as being awfully silly but the rest of it  despite clearly not scaling the heights of the sea hawk       and the black swan        to mention the finest seafaring ventures of its respective stars  is briskly paced and reasonably engaging . incidentally  the film would later go on to be remade as the king  s pirate       with doug mcclure   br    br   for what it  s worth  the unprecedented box office success of that unappetizing modern franchise is most probably what induced reluctant movie studios to dust off their catalogue swashbuckling titles and release them on dvd and  as a matter of fact  against all flags itself was the one gem in a poorly  thought out pirates of the golden age movie collection set from universal which also consisted of obscure dross like buccaneer  s girl       with yvonne de carlo   doule crossbones       with donald o  connor  and yankee buccaneer       with jeff chandler   value for money  perhaps but  so far  i have only acquired the errol flynn flick from other sources even so  if the mood strikes me in future  i might wish to lay my hands on similar marine adventures like edward dmytyk  s mutiny        the afore  mentioned yankee buccaneer and pirates of tortuga       .  ,1
i  ve seen plenty of sci  fi channel original movies ever since i started watching them back in      my first one was sabretooth  which actually is one of the more entertaining sci  fi channel features in my opinion  . their quality varies . some of them are average but decent  sabretooth  dragon fighter  never cry werewolf  swamp devil   some are laughably bad  and then there are some that are truly terrible . raptor planet lies in the latter .  br    br   raptor planet  a loose sequel to the     sci  fi channel original raptor island  is a barely watchable mess of a film with truly horrid acting and lazy scriptwriting . the effects that bring the dinosaurs to life  a combination of puppetry and animatronics as well as cgi and stock footage from raptor planet  are some of the worst looking effects i  ve seen in a low budget film . the gore effects are even unconvincing .  br    br   the plot involves a bunch of commandos who for some reason  i forget why  travel to a planet of alien dinosaurs . that  s right folks  the dinosaurs are aliens . dinosaurs in outer space . what  s next  sharks in space    the rest of the plot is simple . the human cast are picked off and eaten . by now  we  ve come to expect this in the numerous dinosaurs movies and novels that are released  but this is the first killer dinosaur movie i  ve seen where i actually became bored with all the dinosaur attacks .  br    br   there are a few chuckles in it though . there  s one scene that stands out in which a man is being munched by a carnotaur  brought to life by stock footage from the original film  that seconds later becomes a giant raptor . also  a bit of trivia  this is the scene where steven baur is shooting at his own death scene from the first movie .  br    br   while raptor island wasn  t a good film to begin with  its a masterpiece compared to its sequel .  br    br   believe me when i say  this is quite possibly the worst movie syfy has ever aired . it  s darn near unwatchable .  ,0
when i first saw this movie i was with my dad . he encouraged me to watch this movie because it was one of his favorites . after watching the movie it instantly became one of my favorites .  br    br   a river runs through it is about two brothers who each take a different path in life . norman maclean  craig sheffer  is the older of the two brothers and he is set on the path of education . paul maclean  brad pitt  is the rebellious younger brother who travels on a path full of obstacles . the movie follows these characters as the each follow their own path .  br    br   there is no downside to this movie . you will be entertained the whole way through . the acting  directing  and script is all perfect . the two things that are exceptional are the cinematography and the score . both of which entrap you in the world robert redford creates for you .  br    br   this is an all around great movie that is destined to be a classic . it sure is in my book . if you haven  t seen this movie definitely watch it as soon as you can because it will stay with you forever .  ,1
this was a nice attempt at something but it is too pretentious and boring to rise above it  s low budget trappings . the use of virtual sets almost works but at some points it fails miserably . they made good use of the small budget i guess . i just wish the story and most of the acting was better . there are a lot of parts where you see what they were aiming for and it would of been great if they actually hit those marks but they don  t . confusing and unbelievable story . bad dvd transfer too . it doesn  t take much for me to watch a movie in one sitting . this i had to shut off . it was too boring . i can do slow movies . but just make them appealing in some aspect . visually  story  wise  acting  etc . this was lacking in all departments so it never added up to an engrossing experience . maybe the film maker  s next attempt will be better .  ,0
i commented on this when it first debuted and gave it a  thumbs in the middle  review  remarking that i  d give it the benefit of the doubt beyond just the first episode . i  ve seen a total of six episodes now up to this point in june     . and as a lifelong batman fanatic  i can say without hesitation this show is utter crap .  br    br   everything  s wrong with it . everything . getting past just the lousy animation and design  the stories are ridiculously convoluted and with no character development or apparent interest by the writers of this dreck to give any substance to any stories .  br    br   and for god  s sake . . . is it just me  or is the joker in every episode   is gotham that much of a revolving  door justice system  or  again  is it just a complete lack of interest in the writers to put any effort into other villains  see  no character development   above  .  br    br   and to make matters worse  every single joker tale is the same   part formula .  br    br     joker gasses people .  br    br     joker sets out to gas the whole city .  br    br     batman saves the day .  br    br   pfeh .  br    br   there was one episode i saw that wasn  t a joker story . the title escapes me  but the villain was that nefarious cluemaster . . . the  think thank thunk  episode with the quiz show . that was the single  worst batman story i  ve ever seen  heard or read . yes  worse than  i  ve got batman in my basement .   br    br   i can  t really say what i feel this show is because it  s probably against the tos  but it starts with  b  and rhymes with  fastardization  . thank goodness for the existence of the timm  dini  etc . era of bat  entertainment  back from the fox and kids wb days . stuff that good  and i should have known this  just couldn  t possibly have lasted forever  unfortunately .  ,0
i did not intend to write this review  but having read the default review that shows up on this movie  s url  i felt compelled to write a rebuttal . the movie in a word is superlative . it does not deserve the slanderous review that the writer has written . i think the writer has totally missed the point of the movie to a large extent . in fact  i too was turned off by the excessive show of evangelist devotions that occupied the middle of the movie to a large extent . however  i must beg to differ with the reviewer in that  this movie in the end is not a propaganda piece for evangelist action . i think  what the director has shown is that how religion is not enough to find all the answers  how religion is to a large extent incapable of providing answers to basic  simple questions that one may ask and all that religion has to offer is sometimes just banal platitudes of one kind or another . this does not demonstrate a value judgment on religion as we have to remember that religion is transmuted and expressed by ordinary  mostly well meaning  basically good people and they usually have no monopoly on truth and thus religion can not in the end provide the ultimate answers to some questions in life . ultimately  it is a matter of faith . you have to take it on faith and that  s all . and if you are given to faith  then you can appreciate any show of faith . and if you are not given to faith then any show of faith is tiresome . it is thus at the same time  instructive to note the reviewer reaction to the movie . in any case  the director shows us that one can choose not to accept the religious interpretation of events and answers to questions and in spite of that life goes on and there are  secret sunshine  in this world that awaits all wounded souls  regardless of their religious orientation . and that  s just the core message of the film  please note the last scene of the movie  if you don  t get this  in the end  the movie is a great one and very thought provoking and confronts you  the viewer with questions that you have to answer for yourself . thus it is a work of art that is challenging to you personally . i do agree with the reviewer in that  the evangelical stuff was a bit too much . however  given the above interpretation of religion as shown in the movie  i think the director was trying to balance the act whereby he might not be called an evangelist  basher  the actor kang  ho song was great as always . he  s so balanced and just perfect that he  s just amazing . he  s my favorite korean actor no doubt . i know the actress do  yeon jeon got the cannes award for best actress for this movie . however  i did not find any specialty in her acting . it seems that to get awards you just have to act really convincingly in crying and hysterical scenes and all all in all a great movie . if you don  t like it  please watch it again and see if you get it  if it leaves you dissatisfied or uncomfortable or asking questions then think  if that was not what the director was actually aiming at through this movie in the first place   ,1
this movie is suppose to be a mysterious  serious thriller about a man looking for a missing girl . however    minutes into the movie  it turns into a funny  unrealistic story with annoying characters and random scenes . i can  t imagine anyone not laughing when cage randomly karate kicks that blonde girl or when he  bear  punches that old lady . the lines  characters  and acting are all poorly done from the get  go . i  ve always liked nicolas cage as an actor  but he has made some terrible movies this year this being by far the worst one  yet . . .  .  br    br   i wouldn  t recommend this movie to anyone who wants to watch an intense story  gripping thriller . if you really want to enjoy this story  go rent the original . however  if you intend on watching it  get ready to laugh at some of the lines and end scenes rather than taking them seriously that  s the only way you enjoy this film .  ,0
please note that i haven  t seen the film since i discovered it in      and my town is smaller and doesn  t carry it . however  i really want to say something about it . i  m actually doing research for university on the title character richard maurice bucke and would like to point out that the person they based the main character on was in reality completely different    hollywood  s ideas of people and artistic license granted  the real dr . bucke totally endorsed hysterectomies to cure insanity in women  and would never have practiced anything as liberal as represented in the film . i think it  s laughable to see various film critics who write for legitimate newspapers who say this film has some historical basis  the only actual fact i can see is the friendship between dr . bucke and walt whitman . please don  t waste your time on a film with such a disregard to the horror that real women experienced at the hands of this doctor who has now been glorified by the film industry .  ,0
every generation fully believes it is living in the end times . this has been true for thousands of years now . and movies like this feed on this . how did they get the great orson welles to narrate this train wreck  this is a documentary about the biblical prophecies of armageddon . it tries to link the prophecies as well as it can to what was happening in the times it was made  making it obviously dated and kind of silly .  br    br   the reenactments look like they are out of  unsolved mysteries  but without the high production values . people should have been embarrassed to take part in this .  br    br   in short  the movie is dated  silly  reactionary  and useless . good if you want a good laugh  but not good enough to actually look for .  ,0
knowing enki bilal  s comics for quite some time  i had to see this movie . i have thought this would be a good way for the artist as bilal to spread his art and ideas to wider audience . i have also thought this would be a good movie to recommend  and i thought i will enjoy watching it . . . i was wrong  the movie was a true torture to watch . the idea has potential . . . but  movie leaves way too much to be desired  and basically everyone who sees this movie is left with impression that he could do it better . i will not make suggestion whether you should see this movie or not . chances are if you  re reading these pages that you have already seen it  or that you  re gonna see it  but be prepared for very bad    minutes .  ,0

this  the finest achievement from georg wilhelm pabst  s social realism period is based upon a tragedy in early     that claimed the lives of nearly     french miners as a coal dust explosion deep in mines at courrieres in northern france took place after a fire had smouldered for three weeks  eventually releasing deadly pit gas that brought about the fatalities . estimable designer erno metzner creates stark sets that simulate the tragedy  providing a perception of reality  augmented by matchless sound editing  with the only music being produced by integral orchestras during the beginning and ending portions of a work for which aural effects possess equal importance with the eminent director  s fascinating visual compositions . pabst  s manner of  invisible editing  that segues action from shot to shot through movements of players proves to be smoothly integrated within this landmark film that also showcases sublime cinematography utilizing cameras mounted upon vehicles  enabling the director to shift amid scenes without having a necessity of cutting . although the work  s cardinal theme relates to socialist dogma  the unforgettable power of this film is held in its details  born of pabst  s nonpareil skill at weaving numerous plot lines into a cinema tapestry that stirs one to admiration for german rescue squads of whom their fatherland is greatly proud while no less despairing of disastrous losses to the families of french victims certainly  a seminal triumph fully as stimulating today to a cineaste as it was at the time of its first release .  ,1
and rent a good horror movie . it  s like the writer had never seen a horror movie before and didn  t realize every single thing he wrote was clichd and hackneyed and has been parodied to perfection in movies like  scream  and  scary movie  .  br    br   in between the scary bits is the most banal and boring dialog ever written . stupid  we  re going to the prom  junk . i wanted to claw my ears off . honestly   the hills  has better dialog .  br    br   there really was no need to make this movie . leading lady is uninteresting and i kept thinking  her  really  guy is obsessed with her  really    br    br   all the characters act in stupid ways  including the police .  cover the place in teams of   front and back  not one sleepy cop sitting in his car with the window rolled down just waiting for his throat to be slashed .   br    br   the serial killer just swans about murdering everyone he wants without the least bit of problem . no resistance from victims  or doors  . nobody has any protection or the least idea of fighting back  or flipping the security lock on the hotel room door  . the people are like mentally disabled sheep .  br    br   by the by  if you  re a gore fan  you  ll be disappointed too . all the killing is kept offscreen and is   ahem   tastefully done .  so boo hoo for you    br    br   none of the killings is the least bit interesting . most of the time they  ve already happened by the time we find out .  br    br   the only clich missing was the cat that always pops out in this kind of movies .  oh kitty  you scared me  i thought you were the killer   aiieeee    br    br   and then at the end when it  s time for the killer to die   well  let  s just say it  s the easiest and most obvious choice . snore .  br    br   the audience was jeering and talking back to the screen throughout . it was too dumb to believe and not really scary enough . don  t encourage this kind of lazy film  making .  br    br    oh  and by the way   no crowning of a prom king or queen . no tiara . no bucket of blood .   br    br   so save your money and rent  carrie  or  friday the   th  or  halloween  or  scream  or  scary movie   any of them  to get a good scare with some original twists .  ,0
i last night i had the pleasure of seeing the movie bug at the florida film festival and let me say it was a real treat . the directors were there and they did a qa afterwards . the movie begins with a young boy smashing a roach beneath his foot  a man who is nearby parking his car sees the young boy smash it and runs to ask the kid why  why  did he have to kill that living creature   in his rush to counsel the youth in the error of his ways  the man neglects to pay his parking meter  which starts off a whole chain of events involving people not at all related to him  some funny  some sad  and some ridiculous . this movie has a lot of laughs  lots  and there are many actors which you will recognize . the main actors who stood out in the film for me were jamie kennedy  from his comedy show the jamie kennedy experiment  playing a fortune cookie writer john carroll lynch  who plays drew  s cross dressing brother on the drew carey show  playing the animal loving guy who just can  t get it right brian cox  the original hannibal lecter in manhunter  playing the germaphobic owner of a donut and chinese food take out joint . there is one line where cox tells his chef to wash off some pigs blood that is on the sidewalk by saying  clean up that death  which is quite funny mostly because of cox  s  obsessed with germs  delivery . the funniest moment in the movie comes when a young boy imitates his father  whom he heard earlier in the day yell out motherf   while in the classroom . another extremely funny and surreal scene is when trudie styler  mrs . sting herself  and another actor perform a scene on a cable access show  from the film the boy in the plastic bubble . the actor who hosts the cable access show is just amazing he is so serious and deadpan and his performance as both the doctor and the boy in the plastic bubble is enthralling . there are many other fine and funny actors and actresses in this film and having shot it in less than a month with a budget of just about   million  the directors phil hay and matt manfredi  who are screenwriters by trade  having written crazy  beautiful and the upcoming tuxedo starring jackie chan  have achieved a film that is great  funny and endearing .  ,1
this has to be the worst movie ever    the acting is scarier than the movie . lots of blood  but no idea where it comes from  cuz they don  t even show you the cuts . i can  t believe i wasted my time watching this movie . we laughed like we were watching a comedy and not a horror movie . this is a disgrace to horror films    for one if they are in asia why is there a white cop driving past waste management trash cans   there  s so much of another language that you don  t even know what  s going on half the time . the film editing is a joke  my teenager could do better . and if i went to a movie theater and that nasty old man was working the window that would be the first clue . do not watch this movie    not to even see how bad it is  you will be sorry you did    ,0
one of the best low budget movies from germany  is this is the dark side of new age  if you believe in esoteric  please don  t watch this movie  it blows all your positive fantasies away . this movie shows that beyond the peaceful faade of spiritual soul searching lies a world of extreme transgressions and terror . i hope there will be a   mm copy soon  andreas marschall  s first film is just the beginning of a new area  making movies with a few euros  i  m waiting for the second hit   ,1
this is just short of a full blown gore fest based on a stephen king story . two tabloid reporters  one seasoned  miguel ferrer  and one not so accomplished  julie entwisle   begin to believe that a serial killer  michael h . moss  may actually be a vampire . stranger than odd is this modern day blood sucker does not wing his way naturally  but by way of a black cessna he seeks his victims . the gore actually gets gruesome as the film nears its stupid finale . keep in mind that mr . king had nothing to do with this film . i do admit it is a bit scary in the wee hours of the night .  ,0
this was different  that  s for sure . just look at the cast  talk about oddballs .  br    br   william h . macy and ben stiller were the stars  although a bunch of actors almost share the spotlight  in this farce about superhero  wannabees . the most outrageous was played by paul reubens of  pee wee herman  fame .  br    br   there is lots of humor  garish colors and no lulls . it  s a pretty entertaining  lightweight comedy with nothing but goofy characters  all of whom want to be heroes a la superman  batman  spiderman  you name . they have talents in strange areas  however  that the real heroes don  t  and don  t want to   . it  s silly  but you know that going on .  br    br   it  s also a film you can watch in installments and not really miss any continuity . it  s a long movie for one so hectic  so taking a break here and there is okay . the language was tame so kids could enjoy this  too . in fact  i don  t recall any swearing in here  except the guy in the theater next to me who kept uttering   what a dumb  f    ing movie .  i thought it was fun two hours but i  d rather watch it on dvd and take a few breaks .  ,1
spoilers through  br    br   i really am in the minority on this one but i liked this movie . it  s not a classic but it  s definitely involving and quite an adrenalin fueled ride . i definitely thought it was worth at least a  rating .  br    br   perhaps the reason i liked it is because i haven  t seen the original . something tells me that with a movie like this it  s strongest fans will be the people who have not seen the original version and thus  have little to compare it to . this was not a masterpiece but i did get into it quite a lot and it actually made me want to see the original .  br    br   there were a few things i liked about it . one was the casting of kowalkski . viggo mortenson was superb and really brought a lot of charisma to the role . since the bulk of the movie fell on his shoulders  he really needed to be excellent and he was . this was a great role for him .  br    br   another interesting thing about vansishing point was the fact that it  s made for television . i had no idea this was the case when watching it . it sure seemed like a major motion picture and i would never have guessed this was not a big screen release .  br    br   i also found the story to be very absorbing . i  m not one for action movies but i got sucked into this . plus it was a lot more then an action movie in that there was drama  mysticism  a love story  quirky people every which way you turned .  i didn  t even recognize priestly .  and it was touching . this was not a great movie but it is watchable .  br    br   and then there  s the ending . it packs a strong punch and if one  s been involved in the story up to that point  it  s very difficult not to be transfixed at the very end . i am not sure how i feel about the ending . the implication was that kowalkski survived and though i  m highly skeptical of how that would be possible  it is a movie and realism isn  t an ingredient that  s always in the mix when making a movie .  br    br   so i  d have to say i found the end incredibly unrealistic but very touching in a manipulative kind of way  which i don  t usually like but for some reason  is almost forgivable in this movie . admittedly  a lot of things were just props for the plot  could the villains have been anymore stereotypical   but the makers got a lot right even if they got many things wrong as well . however  having said that  i will admit i can understand why someone who  s a major fan of the original would hate this version because  though i have not seen the original  i have seen many original movies i loved being remade with terrible results .  my big dislike is actually sequels .  but i can understand the low ratings if the original is of that high a quality .  br    br   people have compared this to smoky and the bandit . how about a road version of  legends of the fall  meets  thelma and louese  as well  i sure felt touches of both films  both of which i  m a fan of .  i do not think however  that this was a great film . it was better then average to me but far from great . but it was an absorbing  adrenalin fueled  touching movie with excellent casting of the main character . my vote is  of   .  ,1
harman and isings  old mill pond  is a true masterpiece of the art of animation . the consummate skill and artistry that characterise this duos work is nowhere more in evidence than in this cartoon . it is a shame that so many people can see only offence in what is  and was always intended to be  a light hearted piece of entertainment that in no way sought to denigrate black people . if anything it is a tribute to the infectious humour and musicality of the black race . i have not been able to view this confection for many years as the  race commissars  in england have deemed it too offensive to be shown in multi racial britain . if anyone knows where i can obtain a copy i would dearly love to view this masterpiece again . i think those who routinely look for messages and intent that were never intended in these cartoons  which are  after all  sixty years old  should try to lighten up and remember that the world is a very different place today  but that does not mean that anyone has the right to censor what is viewable from the past .  ,1
one hour  eight minutes and twelve seconds into this flick and i decided it was pretty lame . that was right after hopalong  chris lybbert  drops on his horse from a tree to rejoin the good guy posse . i was pretty mystified by the whole hopalong cassidy  great bar   gimmick which didn  t translate into anything at all . obviously  the name coppola in the credits couldn  t do anything to guarantee success here  even with more than one listed .  br    br   if you make it to the end of the film  you  ll probably wind up asking yourself the same questions i did . what exactly was the hook with the gloves  what  s up with the rodeo scenario  who was the stranger supposed to represent  why did they make this film   br    br   i could probably go on but my energy  s been drained . look  there  s already a western called  the gunfighter  from     with a guy named gregory peck as the title character . watching it will make you feel as good as watching this one makes you feel bad . that one i can recommend .  ,0
the really sad thing is that this was supposedly the highest budget  halestorm entertainment  has had to work with . all involved should be fined for littering since all the celluloid they wasted is good for nothing more than filling the trash . not only is the writing atrocious and the jokes awful  but the camera work and film quality are amateur at best . the soundtrack sounds like it was created on some guys laptop pc . the worst part of all is that i actually sat through the whole thing . i think just because i couldn  t believe that i had actually paid to buy a ticket and that the theater i was watching it in had actually agreed to show the  film  .  ,0
i think this has the potential of being the best star trek series yet  i say potential . . we all know there is a chance they will drop the ball and run out of ideas . . . but i hope not  for those that have not seen it . . see it  without that annoying  prime directive  floating over their heads every time they encounter races it could be cool . . and scott bakula was without a doubt a great choice for captain  and the vulcan babe is hot too   check out the decontamination scene  i gave this a full   . . . it blows away all the other series openers . . i hope this goes longer than  years . . .  ,1
i just came back from the montreal premiere of zero day . . . and i  m surprised as hell to find a negative comment on the movie . basically the blame is about coccio doing an easy and overplayed social message . . . well  mr  i  m  a  reviewer  it  s an easy and overplayed critic of movies with a social charge .  br    br   not that i want to expose my life here  but i come from a small town with a similar school than these guys go . reject  ignorance on the menu . thing is . . . i understand how can young kids can be driven to do such horror . high schools have became battle fields of conformity . it  s a real ugly sight . you need to fight your way into being like the others . it  s hard to explain  bit a lot of people dosen  t realize that high schools are becoming cemeteries of human intelligence . meanwhile  parents are closing their eyes and smiling about how their life in their comfortable suburb is perfect .  br    br   the real motive of the movie isn  t about what is driving them . it  s about this death  like calm suburb and everybody closing their eyes and trying to create this atmosphere of a perfect town . cal expressed it well . it  s a wake up call . drama is everywhere and it can take every shape . in that case little dramas  like andre being called a faggot for wearing a j . c penny shirt  are shaping into being the worse nightmare of a whole town . andre  cal took the most extreme way to express their pain . the malaise of unconformity in an era where you need more than ever to be like the others to be accepted .  br    br   i like particularly the last scenes where some guys are burning the crosses of andre  cal  like if with the pain they communicated  cal  andre have communicated their blind rage to their community  their refusal to think about the causes of some acts .  br    br   it might seemed aggressive as a movie  but coccio is meditating more than whining or enunciating . what andre  cal are living is a reality . . . and a scary one that might get to other kids .  br    br   disturbing movie . . . home making and strong feeling made ben coccio do a very very disturbing movie .  ,1
ummm  please forgive me  but weren  t more than half the characters missing  in the original novel  valjean is a man imprisoned for   years for stealing a loaf of bread and then attempting several times to escape . he breaks parole and is pursued relentlessly by the police inspector javert . along the way there are many characters that weren  t in this version . some worth mentioning would be fantine  cosette  m  mme . thenardier  eponine  marius  gavroche  and enjolras . the only character with the same name is javert . i was confused and frustrated throughout the whole movie  trying to see how it was in any way connected to victor hugo  s epic novel .  ,0
where to start  ok  don  t compare this film to fight club for a start  ridiculous . if it was even a patch on fight club  the violence  blood  gore etc would be much more evident and realistic . secondly  this film is no football factory  which is so much more real  and danny dyer makes nicholas nickelby look like an embarrassment  . fair enough  the storyline is quite decent and the fight scenes are well choreographed  with a decent ending i might add . but the film on the whole is poor  seriously poor . as people have been mentioning the accents should not spoil a film  i disagree  either a simple casting error  or a lack of effort in coaching the voices caused the film to be irritating all the way through  it was obvious from scene one some american  geordie was playing the role . don  t get me wrong  good looking guy  who looks great with a skin head  but no not a football hooligan . i could go on forever about how ridiculous the football scene was  the  fake steward  situation . also  when the gse are going to play united up north  they go on the train expecting only  of them  doesn  t make any sense  this a real organisation of gangsters and thugs  which is portrayed in the film to be some mickey mouse cult of about  people . in terms of accuracy  did west ham and milwall not play for the last couple of years they have been in the championship together  hmm  ten years ok . and i  m sure  bother  would be able to just waltz into a milwall firm pub . basically  a very poor film which people will like if they have little knowledge of real football  and hooliganism . if you do actually love football and are intrigued by the underworld of hooliganism   you will simply feel as though this film has insulted your intelligence . ross george  ,0
some of the best movies that are categorized as  comedies  actually blur between comedy and drama .  the graduate  and  butch cassidy and the sundance kid   which were made also in the late      s are perfect examples . are they comedies with dramatic undertones  or dramas with a lot of humor  in many respects   the odd couple  falls into this same category of being both comedy yet highly dramatic with deep underpinnings about human nature . much of what happens may be funny to the audience but the characters are not laughing .  br    br   despite the rather light  hearted tv show of the      s  the original  odd couple  is not merely about a neat guy and messy guy who are forced to live together because of their marital situation . it  s really about two opposites who must face why their marriages fell apart and how their detrimental idiosyncrasies reveal themselves outside of their marriage . neatness  the characteristic of felix ungar  jack lemon perfectly cast  and messiness  the characteristic of oscar madison  walter matthau   are only the beginning and somewhat superficial . as the story unfolds  we find there is a lot more to these men than simply neatness versus messiness .  br    br   briefly  the story is really about felix ungar  who has to face an impending divorce from his wife francis  who we never meet but is an important character throughout the story . on the verge of suicide  ungar goes to the only place he knows the apartment of oscar madison where a group of poker buddies hang out every so often . we learn that ungar is not only a member of this  poker club  but the group knows what  s happening to him and try  in their inept way  to help out . madison figures the best way to help ungar is to let him move in with him until his suicidal tendencies wear off .  br    br   unfortunately for madison  he doesn  t know what he  s getting himself into . madison is a carefree happy  go  lucky if rather irresponsible slob who  s refrigerator was last cleaned probably when herbert hoover was still in the white house . madison  s idea of serving snacks is grabbing moldy cheese and sticking them in between two pieces of bread  and then throwing the contents of a bag of chips on the table . on the other hand  he enjoys booze and women  in short having a good time .  br    br   ungar is not only altogether different  he is diametrically opposite . he is not only an obsessive neatness nut that finds more joy in disinfecting the apartment than meeting women but he knows more than most women do about cooking and fine eating . at one point  he calls his ex  wife  not to talk about reconciling  but to get her recipe for meatloaf . at another moment  ungar was going to spend the rest of the evening cutting cabbage for coleslaw . when madison seems unimpressed  ungar finally confesses he was only doing it for his roommate because he can  t stand coleslaw . who is this guy  but he has another endearing trait felix is also a hypochondriac . he obsesses about his health to the point where he makes strange noises in public places claiming he  s helping his sinuses . he seems to have every health condition in the book . and if they made up more  felix would probably have them . ultimately  he is overly self  absorbed .  br    br   running throughout the movie are references to marriage . at one point when madison is trying to convince ungar to move in  he says   what do you want  a wedding ring   but little does he know that it is not the neat guy who can  t deal with the messy guy  but the other way around . their friendship becomes an inadvertent hellish relationship . and the climax occurs when oscar invites two lonely british sisters for a get  together with both comedic and tragic results . this is one of the best comedies of its type ever written and not to be missed  with superlative performances by walter matthau and jack lemon in roles that are hard to imagine better played by anyone else . it is unfortunate that writing of this caliber is sadly lacking from most comedies being produced today .  ,1
i don  t know about you  but what i love about tom and jerry cartoons is the  often violent  interaction between the two characters . mouse in manhattan sees jerry leaving tom behind to have an adventure in new york  and as far as i am concerned  this one definitely suffers from a lack of cat   br    br   as magical as jerry  s exploration of the  big apple  might be for the other tj fans who have commented here on imdb  i couldn  t wait for this self  indulgent rubbish to end  so i could watch the next cartoon on my dvd .  br    br   in fact  the only part of the whole episode that i genuinely enjoyed was when jerry almost  buys the farm   hanging precariously off the end of a broken candle  hundreds of feet above a busy road .  ,0
i have seen the short movie a few years ago . after that i watch all sequels . the first one is really not the best  but it  s the most popular one . i  ve already watch the making of guinea pig  . it  s really great what these guys did . also the sequels are excellent in the special effects . take your chance to watch it   ,1
neil simon had a knack for dialog and nowhere is this more evident than the lines he gives walter matthau and jack lemmon as opposite types in the odd couple   a mixture of comedy and sadness that depends entirely on the believability of two such mismatched friends sharing an apartment .  br    br   lemmon is neatnik felix ungar  bent on suicide after the divorce from his wife and reluctantly agreeing to share an apartment with oscar madison  matthau  with somewhat disastrous results . seems that everything felix says and does drives oscar up the wall and neither one can stand the other  s ways  with oscar being the messiest male imaginable and felix the exact opposite .  br    br   funniest scene for me was when the giggling pigeon sisters in the apartment above visit them on a dinner date . the priceless interaction between lemmon  matthau and carole shelley and monica evans is enough to put you in stitches . the talented pigeon sisters are the gals who did the voices for the gabble sisters  a pair of geese  in disney  s the aristocats  and here   their comic timing on top of lemmon  s sad story of despair is enough to spin the film into hilarity   where it remains much of the time .  br    br   if you  re a neil simon fan and have enjoyed other screen treatments of his work  this one is not to be missed . matthau and lemmon are perfectly cast  even though they considered exchanging roles before filming began  and  of course  it  s easy to see why it became a top  rated tv show later on .  br    br   summing up top simon comedy  not to be missed .  ,1
     was an amazing year for charlie chaplin . it was his first year in films and he appeared in more than   films  while most of these films weren  t particularly good  they did give him a chance to slowly evolve his screen persona . however  by this film  the familiar  little tramp  character was still in development . sure charlie looked the part  but his character still lacked the sweetness and decency that he later developed . instead  chaplin often hit  kicked or did other nasty things to people for seemingly no reason at all .  br    br   as for this very slight film  it is interesting to watch for the cast . while they are not familiar today  chaplin stars along with mabel normand  chester conklin and mack swain   all exceptionally popular stars with keystone films . the problem with this film is that while it has a few nice scenes  the plot seems very vague and improperly developed . chester and mabel got to the race track  a very common theme in keystone productions   it must have been located near a race track  . charlie and mack show up and sneak in . mack is chased by the police for doing this while charlie slaps chester around and steals his girl . in the end  for no apparent reason  the cops take chester and mack away   leaving charlie with mabel  who  oddly  didn  t seem put off by charlie  s boorish behaviors  .  br    br   unless you are a huge silent comedy buff or film historian  this is a very forgettable film that is only important in the evolution of chaplin . what he and the other actors actually do on stage  while not unusual for a keystone film  isn  t particularly funny when seen today .  ,0
crazed shotgun toting  incest driven  revenge seeking truck drivers  obsessive control disorder  daddy raped me when i was    handcuff carrying  all latex wearing prostitutes is just a few of the character you will be introduced to in this complete disgrace of a movie that can easily be viewed on any cable tv station  ie skinemax  at  am on sunday nights .  and yes i know that was an entire sentence  but bare with me people this is a long  winded review for a short pointless film  .  br    br   filmed in  somewhere  canada  with almost no budget  the plot to this freak show is trite  the police in it obviously never heard of  state jurisdiction  because they end up chasing both miya  hookers  and trent  idiotic  anal retentive  generic  insecure college student  all across the u . s .  and i thought only the fbi could do that  . the camera is shaky  the sex scenes are mediocre and the acting is so bad it might actually cause unintentional acid flashbacks to movies like  ishtar  and  leonard part   .  br    br   as far as the skin scenes go  which is the only reason to even rent this movie  don  t even think of buying it  there are two of them . the first one is the only one worth watching though which is the dominatrix sex scene with kari salin and      insert unknown actor here  he  s obviously done nothing else worth noting  in a seedy  disgusting motel room  the kind with the busted sink that drips  and the soda machine outside that only has blue tonic water left in it  . it  s all sm  riding crops  handcuffs  hot wax  and underwear licking  folks and in the end  he gets left in a motel room  with no money and cops waiting at his door  that  s goes to show you guys  don  t let a hooker tie you up in a  middle  of  nowhere  motel room  . sadly though  kari shows no skin worth remembering  and that alone can cause deep  seeded traumatic experiences for some gentlemen  so that is definitely a downer towards this flick .  br    br   as for the ending  snickersnicker i know you probably wouldn  t mind if i revealed it to you but i won  t  you should spend your hard earned money for that one . all in all i give it a    for action  a    for skin  see last paragraph  and a    for acting  character development or intricate plot twists .  br    br    laughing man  ,0
the magnetism radiated from elvira  drawing her legions of devoted admirers  has a primordial quality . with her lengthy  well  toned figure  large  bust  innocuously mischievous attitude and grab  bag lexicon of me  generation valley slang  the character of elvira has a universal and timeless appeal . as an aspiring folklorist and an individual deeply interested in the structure of storytelling  it is evident that the elvira persona has certain archetypal elements that help to make the character more than the sum of her corny one  liners and large chest . as initiated from the manner in which the children of the town react to her  she represents the deep adolescent fantasy for an experienced woman whom can connect to them of their level a strange mixture of one  dimensional romantic yearning  boyish sexual craving and the desire for non  threateningly lighthearted fun . she symbolizes an undeveloped ideal of womanhood perfected for the boys and a source of strength for the girls of the town . the other adults have trouble with her for the same reasons . in the end  however  her film cannot move pass its more campy ingredients . the end result is that while elvira is infinitely interesting  her film is limited by how weak a showcase it is for her talents . nearly everything is tailored to an adolescent mindset and although it is a straightforward comedy  only those who can still process information with the mind of a young person will be able to enjoy the nonsense . fortunately  i have such ability and found the film to be a delightful charmer .  br    br   best quote bob redding how  s your head  elvira i haven  t had any complaints .  ,1
i rented this film yesterday mostly due to the good  looking art and the summary given on the back of the jacket . after popping it into my dvd player i re  examined the jacket cover and even though i took the cover out of from the plastic viewer  i still could not read any of the production detail information about the film . this film is entitled evil on the jacket and had to locate it by going to faith films website to find out any linkage to it here on imdb .  br    br   the filming and special affects done in the film looked quite good . . . then  a line  reading actor spoke . oh dear . . . this actor  s reading sounded like some pimple  faced high school jock whose voice just managed to change pitch  and no attempt given to go beyond reading the lines from the script . at first i thought i got a bad disc out of audio sync  then had to surmise it was a foreign film since i couldn  t read the jacket . . . english dialog dubbed . if they  d casted the right person for dubbing the dialog  this film might have been decent . i gave it a chance of about   minutes before ejecting it when i discovered the bad line reader wasn  t going to get killed off  but stay as the constant main fixture . yes  it is that bad  the jacket cover art and the art done in the film are great  so gave the one star  but minus          stars for the rotten dialog . i do not recommend this one   ,0
it  s highly stylized  but this movie shows that real people appear on these shows and what seems like good fun and a chance to appear on television can have serious consequences .  br    br   yes  i  s mostly comedy  but there are some sad moments .  ,1
historically accurate  hmm . . . perhaps . . . if you squint  and light falls upon the subject just  so . but core accuracy is no compensation for a dismal  patchy and inconsistent plot  reams of cardboard dialogue and an unsatisfying conclusion . the principal characters are merely characterizations embarrassing stereotypes that range from the  enigmatic and noble  american indians through to the  stuffy but sadistic  british officers . a wretched and unworthy rendition of a fascinating period in american history . i want my money back .  ,0
the idea behind this film was a good one . too bad it wasn  t written well . casting sidney poitier as the fbi agent was a good idea  and he did an outstanding job . tom berenger  on the other hand  only knows one emotion in most of his movies  anger . kirstie alley  s character could have been a great one  and even showed some possibilities once  but the writer really let us down by making her role mostly a helpless female . this was completely inconsistent with the strongly independent character she was supposed to be . i don  t care for alley  s acting anyway . the movie should have ended about fifteen minutes sooner than it did . the director milked the cow dry before the unbelievable final action . i will keep this in my collection only as an example of poitier  s performances .  ,0
a prequel to the re  imagined battlestar galactica series  from the same creative team ronald d . moore and david eick as well as new series co  creator remi aubuchon . caprica is set in the twelve colonies some   years prior to the events of battlestar galactica . the new series in addition to its human drama also chronicles the key steps in the development of what would become the cylon race .  br    br   the pilot and the series are set to follow two families the graystone  s which include daniel  eric stoltz  a computer genius and corporate tycoon and his equally brilliant but rebellious daughter zoe  alessandra toreson   while the adama  s include joseph  esai morales  a lawyer and his son william the future admiral of battlestar galactica .  br    br   like battlestar galactica the series includes some great experienced actors in eric stoltz  esai morales and polly walker as well as some very talented relatively new actors including alessandra toreson and magda apanowicz .  br    br   for fans of battlestar gallactica there are similarities and continuities with that series but it is also very different . in the pilot at least the science fiction elements are definitely present but are smaller part of this series . the scenes on caprica while reflecting a more technologically advanced society also have retro feel  this is achieved through some of the architecture  the costumes and the way it is shot .  br    br   while the look and feel of the two series have some substantial differences some of the themes will seem very familiar  religion is again very important here  while the racial theme rarely touched on in bg is far more important . we also touch on terrorism the existence of a soul and whether or not a machine can have one  as well as issues related to crime and government .  br    br   the pilot has been released direct to dvd in an extended and unrated version prior to airing on tv  the series is set to start in     .  br    br   like battlestar galactica this series is filmed in vancouver  ,1
wow  i just saw this on t . v . as one of the  scary  movies they show around halloween . was this rated g  there wasn  t really anything to make this movie scary  or worth watching . also  other people say this is a spoof  but i don  t think so . for a spoof  you need something called  humor  . this low  budget crap  fest didn  t have a shred of humor  and it didn  t make much sense  either . you basically have a goofy looking monster  man in rubber suit  coming out of closets  killing people  i guess  since you never see the monster doing violence to anyone or any bloody aftermath . the spinning newspaper tells you that people were killed by the monster  so i guess that  s good enough .  br    br   the military tries feebly to kill the monster  which isn  t much larger than a man . they have very bad aim . then the military flees  wow  did this movie make the u . s . military look pathetic or what  the monster  while hard to kill  doesn  t do much besides shuffle around and roar . oh  and occasionally a second head pops out of its mouth and shrieks . it was a slightly interesting  yet a total alien ripoff .  br    br   what was the deal with the scientist playing the xylophone to attract the monster  it was hard to understand a lot of the dialog due to the poor sound quality . also  why did the monster carry around the main wimpy guy for so long  why didn  t the monster go into the closet when it had a chance  why do i insist on trying to make sense out of the senseless   ,0
well  maybe the pc version of this game was impressive . maybe . i just finished playing the ps  version and it  s pretty much a complete mess .  br    br   there are a couple elements that are okay or promising . i  ll mention those first because it will be over quickly . first  the idea of a historical gta  like game is a great one . the game gun was a historical gta  like game and unlike mafia  gun was excellent . i  d love to see a game set during mafia  s era done right . next  the storyline is well written . the story makes sense  it has dramatic arcs  it uses an unusual device  with much of the game being a backstory  and it  s interesting . finally  some of the graphics   especially those used during cutscenes   are impressive . mafia  s designers seemed to focus on getting the graphics right in the places where gta skimped on that effort  especially the characters . unfortunately in many other areas  the graphics kinda stink  and i  d much rather have excellent gameplay than impressive  looking characters .  br    br   the gameplay is what sinks this title so low . first off  the controls and camera absolutely suck . that has to be the first focus of any game developers . you can  t release a game where the controls and  or camera suck . number one  there  s no reason that the player  s character  tom  can  t have his full range of motion controlled by the left analog stick . unless it  s absolutely necessary  and it hardly ever is  i hate the set  up where the left stick moves the character in a  strafing  way and the character can only turn using the right analog stick . here  it  s not only unnecessary  it makes most of the simplest actions a challenge . for example  tom has to climb on a couple missions . but the game is designed so poorly that you have to frustratingly keep manipulating both the right analog stick and the camera  and then press l  every time you need to climb  or tom will descend instead .  br    br   next  i  ve never seen a worse fighting system . the first problem is that you can  t auto  aim or lock on to any targets . at one early point  the game seems to tell you that you can use l  or r  to lock on to targets  but that never worked . so to focus on any enemy  you have to struggle with the stupid right analog stick and try to keep adjusting both the character  s orientation and the camera  which tends to drift to the wrong angle or make tom disappear all the time . by that time  you  re probably getting pummeled or shot to death .  br    br   next  if you  re touching or almost touching an enemy   and that  s certainly going to be the case for hand to hand combat or when using melee weapons  the fighting system   which primarily consists of tapping or holding r   is completely useless . enemies can pummel you almost in a bear hug  but you just can  t move unless you back off . so close fighting tends to consist of you yanking on the left analog stick  yelling at the character to move away  which it won  t do    of the time  then tapping r  as much as you can before the enemy gets too close again and makes r  useless . and if the enemy changes their angle to you in the meantime  you  re also going to struggle with the right analog stick to get your character oriented in the right way and to get the camera in position so you can see anything . by that time  you  re probably getting pummeled or shot again  and your only option will be to try to move the character away again . my fights often consisted of making tom run circles around an area like a comedy film  hoping that i could gain enough time to struggle with the analog stick and get a couple shots in before being at the ai  s mercy again . so much for realistic fighting .  br    br   and the same problems and more exist when trying to fight with guns . if you  re touching someone  half the time the controller just won  t allow you to fire off a shot  yet they can still riddle you full of holes . additionally  there  s no auto  aim  and the aiming system is ridiculously sensitive  even with the sensitivity set to zero under options . gunfights tend to consist of you hopelessly trying to aim or move away while the enemy puts shot after shot into you . luckily or not  damage seems to be recorded almost randomly . it can take one to ten shots or more to incapacitate any character  and there  s no rhyme or reason to it . you can put five shots into an enemy  s head and near point blank range and they  ll still return fire and hurt you . yet  the game designers seemed to care enough about realism than they built a recoil into your aiming system  so after shots with powerful enough guns  your aim will float off target  and you  ll have to fight with it again .  br    br   as for the celebrated graphics  except for the characters and textures that you  re close to  they  re actually pretty disappointing . the distance always seems mostly empty  and there are often expanses of flat colors and textures nearby when you  re driving . the city wasn  t very well designed . it  s not varied enough  and there aren  t many interesting things to see or do . the cars seem slow and they  re difficult to control . they also all drive about the same . some have mentioned the music  but that was also pretty nondescript . a much better job could have been done on that end . also  as many others have mentioned  the load times are ridiculous and constant . they tend to be over a minute long  and they occur between and in the middle of everything   even races .  br    br   overall  the mafia port to ps   at least  seems to have been very rushed . the game feels and plays like an incomplete hack job .  ,0
how many more of those fake  slice of life  movies need to be made  hopefully not too many .  br    br   raising victor vargas is a very self  conscious attempt by the director peter solett at garnering the attention of hollywood . nothing wrong with that in general . what is wrong with this film in particular is that it ignores the audience and piles on every clich in the book of supposedly  edgy  hollywood independent production .  br    br   it  s supposed to be  real  so left shake the camera  documentary style   except no documentarian would shake the camera on purpose . . .  br    br   it  s  edgy  so let  s not waste any time lighting the film .  br    br   it  s  hip   so let  s have the children use swear words like al pacino in scarface . . .  br    br   and so on  and so forth . all that you are left with is a very self  conscious attempt at impressing hollywood that won  t impress anyone outside of the  rarefied  indie crowd that seems to still heap acclaim on every bad film .  ,0
all day now i  ve been watching dinosaurs  and all day they  ve had the same fundamental problem .  br    br   they don  t believe in firearms . they just don  t seem to have been  told  about them or something . bullets  bounce  off of dinosaurs  maybe it  s because they became extinct millions of years before the invention of gunpowder  and the laws of physics were just different back then . . . aah  no . come on . if they  re close enough to chemically operate today  they  d have to be vulnerable to fast  even subsonic  lead projectiles . it  s that simple .  br    br   look  the toughest  skinned reptiles on the planet today  alligators and crocodiles  are completely vulnerable to basic rifle fire . they  re nothing magic . you can shoot a pistol round right through the heavy scales on their backs . they don  t take armor  piercing bullets or anything special . small bullets penetrate them  they just don  t kill them . somewhat  but not really  large bullets are preferred because the challenge  as with most game  is to kill the animal with one shot  so it doesn  t run .  hunters consider it immoral to allow prey to run off and die unharvested .   br    br   most animals  including predators  are easily repelled by gunfire . between the noise  and the pain of even a non  lethal wound  most will run away . an exception are big bears  which are so fearless that they  re merely enraged by mortal wounds . cape buffalo are regarded as highly dangerous because they are well known to charge when wounded . we  ve seen video of the big bulls of a herd of cape buffalo rescuing a calf from an entire pride of lions . a big cat will run if it can  but if it can  t it will charge as a final act of desperation . where a t . rex would fit in this spectrum is unknown . their behavior simply has not been observed . with these larger animals  safe hunting becomes a matter of applying an appropriately large and powerful projectile  and  or applying several of them rapidly enough to counter its charge . with a t . rex  of course  this could be a serious problem . i  ve seen a t . rex skull  they have one in the museum downtown  and carrying a gun big enough to bust that might be impractical . chewing its neck off with lots of smaller fire might be a more viable approach . small bullets would still  penetrate  them  they wouldn  t just bounce off just because the animal is too big to easily kill   br    br   so here we have cortez and his men  this is  before  the famous mexican campaign  apparently  captured by american natives and scheduled for sacrifice on the pyramid . it appears that all those human sacrifices were about appeasing the bloodthirst of the pair of t . rexes that terrorized the continent in the day . rather than just having their hearts cut out and being fed to the lizards  cortez et al talk the aztecs into letting them hunt  kill them . ok  maybe they don  t have m    s like the guys in the  carnosaur  series  but they  do  have flintlocks  crossbows  pointed sticks  big ones  made from trees  and swords . maybe that  s a little less uneven than squads of soldiers with full auto  but they  ve several guys and i  d quickly bet on them over a dinosaur . oh  wait  there  s a  cannon   about a   incher . that  s just the ticket for busting a tyrannosaurus  skull  so they lay a trap  with a squad of men  cannon  pointed sticks in a ravine  and lure the first t . rex into it  using a pretty brown girl as bait . cortez points out that they  ll not have time to reload  so they  ll have to close the range until they can be certain of their aim . t . rex totally ignores their volley of flintlock fire  and we see both a crossbow bolt  and  the cannon ball  bounce  off  forget it . end of credibility . a crossbow bolt would defeat cortez  torso armor  and a   cannon ball might penetrate the hull of a wooden ship  this would also  certainly  get through the hide  ribcage  or skull of any animal ever to walk this planet .  do you think a  whale  could withstand a   cannon ball   and here  s t . rex  still standing  not even bleeding . so cortez lures it to the ravine  where it falls onto the pointed sticks  which  i guess by magic  penetrate it and kill it . yaaay  pointed sticks   br    br   the dinos aren  t completely invulnerable to gunfire  they manage to put out an eye of the second one with a pistol . this runs it off  so it  s not as mean as a bear or a buffalo  at least in the movies .  br    br   they kill the second dinosaur with a bomb  made from a gourd filled with gunpowder and gemstones . my money would still be on the cannon . it  s engineered function is to concentrate all the gunpowder  s energy in one direction  toward the target . a bomb is a much more diffused application of force . a  real  bomb  not a gourd bomb  has a steel casing which contains the explosion to extremely high pressure .  think pipe bomb vs firecracker .  a pile of gunpowder set on fire will simply go poof .  trust me on that one .   ,0
jason bourne sits in a dusty room in with blood on his hands  trying to make sense of what he  s just done . meanwhile  a cia chief in nyc outlines the agency  s response to what  s just happened on screen . an american flag stands proudly on the centre of his desk in the foreground of the shot  but as he speaks  it slips out of focus as his plan veers into morally dubious territory  as if it doesn  t want to be associated with the course of action the government man decides is necessary in the interests of national security .  br    br   this shot effectively captures the mood of the film . as well as portraying bourne  s quest to find out how he became jason bourne  ultimatum is also an examination of the human costs of the measures taken to protect us in the interests of stability and security .  br    br   it is also probably the best film you  ll see in the cinema this year .  br    br   it  s just so intense . bourne says to simon ross  considine   this isn  t some newspaper story  this is real  and in the audience you almost believe him . the camera shakes  but remains steady enough for you to see everything and feel like you  re there with bourne as he tries to elude his pursuers  and the performances are so good that these guys seem as though they are the characters they  re portraying  instead of just being actors performing well  written roles . the action scenes are so brutally fast  paced and well choreographed that they seem instinctive instead of planned to the minutest movement the stunt  work is nothing short of amazing .  br    br   the pacing is just incredible . it keeps driving forward towards its conclusion  but not so fast that it leaves you struggling to piece together the plot the script delivers the information you need as quickly and clearly as possible before moving on to the next tense action set  piece . while they  re often simple  the waterloo sequence is essentially just a man on a phone being watched by a man on a phone  they  re charged with such dramatic intensity that you can  t take your eyes off them . the film is just so focused on powering forwards that you can  t help being swept along by it .  br    br   with its intense action set  pieces  brilliantly paced storyline  and intelligent examination of the decisions made in the name of national security  the bourne series is one that accurately captures the ambiguities of our age . ultimatum is its peak .  ,1

as someone who has both read the novel and seen the film  i have a different take on why the film was such a flop . first  any comparisons between novel and film are purely superficial . they are two different animals .  br    br   the novel is probably intended as a satire  but it arrives as a cross between tragedy and polemic instead . any comedic elements such as those which later formed the stylistic basis of the film version are merely incidental to the author  s uniformly cynical thrust . and lest the omnipresent white suit of the author fool you into thinking this is another mark twain  think again . a more apt literary precedent would be the spectre of ambrose bierce in a top hat and tails . tom wolfe is equal parts clown and hack  more celebrity than author  always looking for new grist for his self  absorbed mill .  br    br   it is therefore no wonder that the excellent production skills and direction lavished on the making of the film were doomed from the start . unlike true satire  which translates very well into film  polemics are grounded not in universally accessible observations on some form or other of human behavior  but in a single  minded attack on specific people   whether real or fictional straw men   who have somehow earned the wrath of the writer . any effort to create a successful filmed story or narrative from such a beginning must have a clean start  free of the writer  s influence or interference .  br    br   having said that  i too find fault with the casting . it is not merely that incompetents like bruce willis and melanie griffith fail to measure up  but that real talents like tom hanks  f . murray abraham  and morgan freeman are either totally wasted or given roles that are mere caricatures .  br    br   there is enough topical material here for a truly great film satire  but it fails to come even close .  ,0

this is a collection of documentaries that last   minutes  seconds and  frame from artists all over the world . the documentaries are varied and deal with all sorts of concepts  the only thing being shared is     as a theme  very minor in some cases  . some of the segements are weak while others are very strong some are political  some are not some are solely about      some simply use     as a theme to touch on human feelings  emotions and tragedies that are universal some are mainstream while others are abstract and artistic  . this film has not been censored in any fashion by anyone so the thoughts that you see are very raw and powerful .  br    br   this is a very controversial film  especially for conservative americans . i think two segments might really tick off the right wingers  one from egypt where a dead american soldier and a dead palestinian bomber come back as spirits another from uk which recounts the us  backed overthrow of chile on sept         which resulted in       deaths and horrible atrocities  . the segment from mexico was the most powerful  recounting the fall of the towers and the resulting death in vivid fashion  you have to see it to believe it  .  br    br   even though the final product is uneven  with some segments being almost  pointless   i still recommend this . it  s very difficult to rank this film because the segments vary all over the place  some weak  some very powerful  . i  m giving this a rating of  out of   simply because some segments were excellent and covered issues that usually get censored  mexico segment  uk segment  japan segment  egypt segment  .  ,1
i got this film about a month ago and i am now a fanatic fan of drew barrymore  s . i love a happy ending and this film gives a brilliant one with the truths of red sox slotted in  it  s about a maths teacher who takes some promising kids on a maths trip to a company where the successful lindsey  drew  shows them some information . this then leads in the ben  teacher  and lindsey dating . but it isn  t all simple when he confesses he is a massive red sox fan .  br    br   first of all things are fine but then his baseball gets in the way of lindseys life . it  s all fine in the end and it took one shot to get drew running across the field   i got it for two quid in blockbusters so i was happy . if you like films like this i suggest you see some more of drew  s work like charlie  s angels and   first dates or even her new film with hugh grant in called music and lyrics .  ,1
a movie of outstanding brilliance and a poignant and unusual love story  the luzhin defence charts the intense attraction between an eccentric genius and a woman of beauty  depth and character .  br    br   it gives john turturro what is probably his finest role to date  thank goodness they didn  t give it to ralph fiennes  who would have murdered it .  similarly  emily watson shows the wealth of her experience  from her outstanding background on the stage  . to reach the tortured chess master  turturro  her character has to display intelligence as well as a woman  s love . watson does not portray beauty  pageant sexuality  but she brings to her parts a self  awareness that is alluring .  br    br   in a chance meeting between natalia  watson  and luzhin  she casually stops him from losing a chess piece that has fallen through a hole in his clothing  a specially crafted piece that  we realize later in the film  has come to symbolize his hopes and aspirations . later  as their love affair develops  she subtly likens dancing to chess  luzhin has learnt to dance but never with a partner   she encourages him to lead her with  bold  brilliant moves  and in doing so enables him to relax sufficiently to later play at his best  and also realize himself as her lover  .  br    br   this is a story of a woman who inspires a man to his greatest achievement and  in so doing finds her own deepest fulfillment  emotionally and intellectually  or so we are led to believe  certainly  within the time frame  natalia is something of a liberated woman rather than someone who grooms herself to be a stereotypical wife and mother  .  br    br   the italian sets are stunning . the complexity of the characters and the skill with which the dialogue unfolds them is a delight to the intelligent movie  goer  yet the film is accessible enough to make it a popular mainstream hit  and most deservedly so . chess is merely the photogenic backdrop for developing an emotional and emotive movie  although the game is treated with enough respect to almost convince a chess  player that the characters existed . although a tragedy of remarkable heights by a classic author  the final denouement is nevertheless surprisingly uplifting .  ,1
shot on an impossible schedule and no budget to speak of  the movie turned out a lot better than you would expect  certainly much more true to the peter o  donnell books and comic strip than the previous two films . you can read the strip currently in the reprints from titan books  or in comics revue monthly . it is one of the greatest adventure comic strips of all time . the movie isn  t great  but unlike most low budget films it makes the most of what its got  and it holds your interest . on the dvd extras  the interview with quentin tarentino  who is obviously stoned  is a gas . some people have faulted tarentino for associating his name with the film  but without him it would never have been made . he is a modesty blaise fan  and picked a good writer and director . all things considered  worth  stars .  ,1
sometime in      saban had acquired the rights to produce a brand  new ninja turtles live  action series . naturally  being a fan of the tmnt back in the day  this obviously peaked my interest . so when i started watching the show . . . to say i was disappointed by the end result is an understatement . some time later  more like recently   i got a chance to revisit the series .  br    br   first off  let  s talk about some of the positives . they managed to re  create the turtles  lair as it was last seen in the movies fairly well given the limited budget they threw in with this . there tends to be this darker atmosphere overall in terms of the sets and whatnot . and the turtle suits  while not the greatest piece of puppetry and whatnot  were functional and seemed pretty sturdy for most of the action stuff that would follow in the series .  br    br   people tend to complain about getting rid of shredder quickly and replacing him with these original villains who could have easily been used in a power rangers show . but you can only have shredder get beat so many times before it gets boring and undermines his worth as a villain . . . and besides  most fans don  t realize or don  t remember or just plain ignore the fact that in the original comic  the shredder was offed in the very first issue  never mind the countless resurrections that would follow . so on a personal standpoint  i was sort of glad they got rid of shredder because then the anticipation would build to the point where they would eventually bring him back in a later episode . i find that shredder in small quantities work best because then his encounters with the turtles are all the more memorable .  br    br   unfortunately  they end up replacing him with these original villains who  as stated  seemed more fit for a power rangers show than a ninja turtles show . and with these new magic  wielding generics comes a new female magic  wielding turtle  the infamous venus de milo . i  ll be honest i never got comfortable with her . i  m not against the idea of a female turtle i  m just against the idea of one who uses magic and thus sticks out like a sore sight among a clan of ninja turtles who seem somewhat out of their domain . i almost get the impression that this could have easily been the venus de milo show dealing with her make  believe enemies and the tmnt are just there to provide the star power  or whatever was left considering the timeframe this was released  . fortunately  they all share the spotlight together .  br    br   next mutation was canned after a season on the air and the creators were more than happy to ignore it . given time and maybe another season  i really believe this live iteration of the tmnt could have been something and might have gotten a chance at greatness . but while the idea was sound  the execution was flawed  although there are a couple good episodes in this series  . as it stands  next mutation is one of those oddities in turtledom that is best left buried and forgotten .  ,0

upon the straight story release in      it was praised for being david lynch  s first film that ignored his regular themes of the macabre and the surreal . based on a true story of one man and his journey to visit his estranged brother on a john deere    mower  at first glance its an odd story for lynch to direct . yet as the story develops you can see some of lynch  s trademark motifs coming through .  br    br   lynch  s focus on small town america and its inhabitants is still as prevalent as in his previous efforts such as blue velvet or twin peaks  but the most notable difference is that the weirdness is curbed down . the restrictions imposed means that the film has the notable accolade of being one of the few live action films that i can think of that features a g rating . incredibly significant  this films stands as evidence that beautiful and significant family films can be produced .  br    br   the straight story was the first feature which lynch directed where he had no hand at writing . for many lynch devotees this was a huge negative point . almost universally acclaimed  the only overly negative review by james brundage of filmcritic . com focused on this very criticism  that it wasn  t a typical lynch film .  lynch is struggling within the mold of a g  rated story that isn  t his own .  brundage claims  with his protagonist alvin straight  quoting lines directly from confucious .  he argues that the story is weak and the dialogue even worse . yet this is about the only criticism that many will read for the film . whilst it is true that it is not lynch in the sense of eraserhead  lost highway or mulholland drive  all films which i also adore  the straight story features a different side of lynch that is by no means terrible . if you are a lynch fan  it is most important to separate that side of lynch with this feature .  br    br   the narrative is slow and thoughtful  which gives you a real sense of the protagonist  s thoughts as he travels to his destination . alvin constantly is reminded about his past and his relationships with his wife  children and his brother . yet particularly significant is that there are no flashbacks  which only adds to the effect  which reminded me of my conversations with my grandparents . the conclusion arrives like watching a boat being carried down a slow meandering river and it is beautiful to watch . the natural landscapes of the us are accentuated and together with the beautiful soundtrack by angelo badalamenti  makes me yearn to go to america . the performances are also excellent with every actor believable in their roles and richard farnsworth is particularly excellent . his oscar nomination was greatly deserved and it was a shame that he didn  t win . regardless  however it is probably the finest swan  song for any actor .  br    br   so whilst the straight story features none of lynch  s complex narratives or trademark dialogue  the film is a fascinating character study about getting old and comes highly recommended   ,1
i wanted to see it because of two reasons . one  it was the remake of high sierra with bogart  two  the bogart part was played by jack palance  whom can play dramatic roles with some subtility  as in the big knife .  br    br   but now i wonder why they decided to shoot this remake . the film follows the same plot as hig sierra only here  the actors don  t care  the director is lost in his thoughts  and who knows what the producer was thinking . jack palance is getting bored looking at shelley winters and shelley winters is asking herself what she  s doing in this film . i don  t even want to compare her to ida lupino in the same role . and of course  they had to use the dog story again  they surely could have come up with some different ideas . perhaps the color makes it nice to see the same location where they shot high sierra  but that definitely doesn  t add any quality to the film .  br    br   it  s a waste of time if you  ve seen high sierra before . otherwise  why not see a pseudo  film noir . as for me  i  d rather die than see it one more time . . .  ,0
i  ve seen this movie at least fifty times and after watching it last week for the first time in a long time i still felt it .  br    br   the story itself was incredible but came alive by spielberg  s expertise and the fabulous cast including whoopi goldberg  oprah winfrey  danny glover  and margaret avery . akosua busia deserved an oscar nomination for her short but powerful portrayal of nettie .  br    br   you  ll experience every human emotion while watching this film . i laughed  cried  and got angry . like most great movies it was looked over by the academy with a host of nominations but no wins . but this movie  without a doubt  is definitely one of the best films of all time .  ,1
ok this movie was made for one reason and one reason only to make money   the producers obviously didn  t care about killing a classic horror movie . i knew this movie would suck as soon as it was going to be a pg    how many pg    slashers movies have turned out to be good  thats like asking how many women have been on the moon  the answer is none   prom night     was of cource no masterpiece but it certainly deserves to be recognised as a movie that stays true to its genre and deosnt try to be anything more than that .  br    br   my problem with prom night     is the way that it handles the killer and i have  major problems with him . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  br    br     the way he escapes  he was locked up in a mental institute and he escapes through a air conditioning vent   what the hell  why would they have an air conditioning vent in the patients room  do they want him to be comfortable during his stay or something    his intentions are somewhat uncertain the killer want all of the main victims family and friends dead so he can have her all to his self  he says he loves her but the next minute he trys to kill her  so does he want to kill her  love her or just plain rape her     the killer is too good  how did he develop all of his skills  he used to be a teacher  so in this one scene where he kills the main victims boyfriend while hes basically on top of her asleep and she doesn  t notice  it all silly  stars out of   terrible  silly  stupid attempt at a horror movie  ,0
at the point in time that the lady from shanghai was being made  the marriage of orson welles and rita hayworth was disintegrating . the film was as much an effort by welles to rekindle the old flames as it was to make a classic noir . not received well at the time  the lady from shanghai has gotten more and more critical acclaim as years pass . gotten better with age so to speak .  br    br   welles is irish seaman michael o  hara who on a fateful night rescues the beautiful rita hayworth from three muggers in central park . sparks do fly  but then comes the rub  turns out the lady is married to crippled  but brilliant criminal attorney everett sloane . nevertheless sloane takes an apparent liking to welles and hires him to skipper his yacht .  br    br   so far this film is starting to sound a lot like gilda . if orson had seen gilda and was not at this point thinking with his male member  he would have skedaddled back to the seaman  s hiring hall in lower manhattan . instead he gets himself involved in a lovely web or intrigue and finds himself pegged for two murders and sloane as his eminent counsel .  br    br   welles for whatever reason decided that his wife would be a blond in this film . supposedly harry cohn hit the roof as rita was internationally known for her coppery red hair . this may have soured him on the picture as he joined the legion of studio bosses who saw welles  s vision of independent film making a threat to their power .  br    br   stage actor glenn anders plays sloane  s partner grisby who is one slimy dude  he winds up a corpse . the other corpse to be here is ted decorsia  a bottom feeding private detective who tries to go in business for himself .  br    br   it  s a good noir thriller  showing rita at her glamorous best even if she was a blond here . the final shoot out in the hall of mirrors is beautifully staged  but i wouldn  t recommend seeing it if one is on any controlled substance .  ,1
the tragedy is that this piece of rubbish was part of my curriculum while i was studying cinema . so imagine how i was forced to watch it in complete . believe me going through hell is much much easier . our professor told us that this is some film     but he never thought that we  d disagree or assume the apposite . i don  t think that there is any gods on earth  we  re only humans  so all the filmmakers  therefore they can make mistakes  bad movies . . or very bad too . the main problem wasn  t that art  by all means  is susceptible to endless points of view  but that a lot of people just don  t get it  that every single human got his own genuine taste  his own opinion  hence what i suppose it the greatest movie ever made  can also be your worst one ever  and how that is right both ways  but how many people can understand this correctly  . so my professor believes in this movie  and simply i don  t . however  the only way to evaluate this  thing  is by measuring it by its original intent to show us different kinds of old folk stories or whatever to catch on this society  s mentality  imagination  and nature . to tell you the damn truth mr . pier paolo pasolini as the scriptwriter and the director made it too unbearable to watch in the first place . the movie is so ugly . i can  t stand this  so how about analyzing it  then discovering the potential beauty in it   it  s beyond your mind hideousness  and strangely not for the sake of the movie  s case or anything  it  s for the sake of the unstable vision of  pasolini  . his work is so primitive to underdeveloped extent . the deadly cinematic technique  the effective sense of silliness  and the incredible horribleness made everything obnoxious . look at the atrocious acting  the unfruitful cinematography  the awfully poor sets  . . oh my god i  ve got the nausea already . it can terminate your objectivity violently as watching this movie is one true pain like taking the wisdom tooth off by a blind doctor . there are dreadful nightmares which could be more merciful than this . so originally  how to continue that just to review it fairly  actually  you don  t . as this very movie doesn  t treat you fair at all . there is really memorable scene in here where some boys are peeing into the eye of the camera    i  m trying to connect some things like that with pasolini  s end as murdered .  ,0
i like a lot of the actors  actresses involved in this project so being insulted by the movie felt even worse than if they used a unknowns . the main problem was this movie was clearly just a concept created to appeal to baby boomers . in   or   years nbc will probably do a movie just like this about the early    s . i can see it now a black family where the kids are involved with the la riot  s and the white family has the kids rebel and listen to grunge rock music . the soundtrack will feature bands like nirvana  n . w . a  public enemy  soundgarden etc . the movie like this will be just as cheesy as the    s and i gurantee you nbc will do it . see the biggest problem with period pieces when done buy networks is that when you are living in a certain time period you aren  t thinking i am living in the    s or whatever decade is trendy retro at the time . next time someone does something like this they should put more weight into there project  ,0
boris and bela do well together in this film  whether they are against each other  or paddling the same boat . i saw this one in      and just purchased it from borders this year . this time watching it with my children  i took note of  things it held the attention of a    and  year old and i caught a few things i hadn  t when i first watched it . very swift story with an unpredictable end . a must for movie buffs     ,1
the second care bears movie is immensely better than its predecessor . it has a deeper plot  better character development  and the tunes  especially the closing song  are both catchy and warm  hearted . sure the movie tends to over stress caring but come on  it is a care bears movie . this movie is a great picture to show to kids because it emphasizes friendship  love  and again  caring . not to mention the care bears are just too adorable   ,1
okay like most steven seagal fans i know i not going expect a masterpiece every time he makes a film but i do expect the film to at least have some sorter budget . the main problem with the copy i watched was the terrible over dubbing i know that in some films this has to be done and i accept that but when they overdub with a totally different actors voice and keep doing this thru out the film it does take the magic of overdubbing away . also the sets seem to be built with no care as in one scene the sliding glass top in a top secret lab has a massive crack going thru it . i was truly disappointed with this film and only hope stevens next project will be more finished off before sending the film out for buying  renting . the story of this film had me wondering if i was watching a sci  fi film or not some parts seemed alien like but they never fully explained what was going on i found it very confusing .  ,0
i thought it would at least be aesthetically beautiful . it was slow  pretentious  and boring . i almost fell asleep . there are some decent songs  but there is this one song at the end which is just some guy yelling out  yaowwww   while someone taps randomly on a wooden object . that being said  there are some pretty songs  but it  s not worth seeing hte movie over . go on itunes  they have the album   preview it  and choose the good ones .  br    br   half the movie is some guy making tea . well  that  s a slight exaggeration . but you  ll see what i mean if you see it . that being said don  t see it   ,0
i couldn  t wait to put this movie in my dvd player when i rented it . then after i started it  i couldn  t wait to get it out of my dvd player . actually i watched all of the movie . my wife and i kept waiting and waiting for something funny to happen  but nothing funny ever does . the box read like the it would be really funny . the premise of the movie sound good . ben stiller is funny . jack black is funny . how could this movie miss  well . . . . it does miss  this is the unfunniest  comedy  i have ever watched . nobody i have talked with thought it was even slightly funny . it is just a really lame movie . trust me . avoide it . . . . avoide it    ,0
seriously  i can easily stomach a lot of on screen blood  gore and repulsiveness  but what really makes this film disturbing  uncomfortable to watch is how the doctor character keeps on rambling about the physical damage done to raped women . he  john cassavetes of  rosemary  s baby   talks about ruptured uterus  dry intercourse and massive loads of reddish    sperm like they are the most common little ailments in the world of medicine . that being said   incubus  is an ultimately strange horror effort . it isn  t necessarily awful  although it isn  t very good  neither  but just plain weird . the muddled  incoherent script initially revolves on the hunt for a rapist  killer of flesh and blood  even though the title clearly suggests the involvement of a supernatural creature  and it never seems to stop introducing new characters . none of these characters  especially not the main ones  come across as sympathetic and for some never  explained reason they all seem to keep dark secrets . the aforementioned doctor has an odd interpretation of daughter  love and continuously behaves like he  s a suspect himself  the town  s sheriff  john ireland  appears to be in a constant state of drunkenness and doesn  t even seem to care about who keeps raping  killing the women in his district  the female reporter is even too weird for words and the galens  an old witch and her grandson  are just plain spooky . all together they desperately try to solve the mystery of whom or what exactly is destroying the towns  women reproducing organs . the sequences building up towards the rapes  murders are admirably atmospheric and the vile acts themselves are bloody and unsettling . basically these are very positive factors in a horror film  but the narrative structure is too incoherent and the characters are too unsympathetic for  incubus  to be a really good film . also  there are quite a few tedious parts to struggle yourself through  like footage of a bruce dickinson concert   and the usually very reliable john hough  s direction is nearly unnoticeable . the final shot is effectively nightmarish  though . for me personally   incubus  was a bit of a disappointment  but there are still several enough reasons to recommend this odd piece of early    s horror to open  minded genre fanatics .  ,0
what a boring film  to sum it all up  its was basically just nana patekar beating up his daughter  in  law karisma kapoor  while she tried to flee from the village  with her son . can someone say boring    the concept wasn  t too bad  but it was poorly executed . the canadian locales  and some of the village scenes were nicely shot . however  overall the cinematography came up short . the story could have been great  but the movie just seemed to drag on . there is only so much stupidity a person can take  let alone three bloody hours of it .  br    br   the best part of the whole movie was the song  ishq kamina   and that was only five minutes long . other than that  this movie was a piece of crap .  ,0
my children watch the show everyday that its on . its a great program for younger children . however they need to stop showing re  runs and do some more actual shows and get rid of rooney  s and deedee  s yellow teeth . moe is the only doodle bop with clean white pearlie teeth and the children notice these things and ask if the  don  t ever brush their teeth  does the show ever make its way to the united states and if so where can we find its schedule at . and one other thing if we might be able to add . moe you need to stop hiding so much . sometimes when you pop up out of no where you scare the younger children and whats with the pulling of the rope  what does that signify  other then getting wet all the time . they need to add newer things to their show instead of the same ole same ole . kids loose interest that way .  ,0
my    year  old daughter  alexandra  writes  br    br   i thought it was very boring  and i thought it was just a repeat of stuff from     dalmatians .  i couldn  t wait for the movie to end . the best part was the credits at the beginning  they were cute and well done . the rest of the film is not worth watching . thank you .  ,0
if you want to see a movie that terribly mixes up one latin country with any other latin country   the celestine prophecy  is a good example  . per  not even in its most violent times  has not shown polices or soldiers as much as in this film . this showed a country like el salvador when civil war . since i  m a peruvian who lives in lima  the capital of per   it was too funny to me seeing the police guards here  there and everywhere .  . if you have a car in per  and you want  or need  to be a taxi driver  just post a sticker with the word  taxi  on the front glass of your car and you can drive freely in peruvian streets  there are taxi companies  but their rates are quite expensive  . no need of yellow or a black  white squared band on the doors of your car . well  taxis in this film have that band  somethin that you will never see in per .  . peruvian people are not caribbean styled clothing . for example  when a taxi driver comes out  he was wearing a  guayabera   cuban shirt   a white hat  and    s mustaches  like clark gable . not one peruvian man looks like that  please  per is not the caribbeans   . a scene shows a woman on a street with a quite long skirt  like the typical folklore dresses in latin america . take a walk anywhere in per  and you  ll never find a woman wearing like that  unless you are watching a typical dance .  . cast could  ve been better i can not deny hctor elizondo is a great actor  but he  s not a latin actor  his father was basque and his mother from puerto rico  but he was born in new york  and his spanish is not fluent . it  s notorious spanish is not his first language . there are dozens of very good latin actors who could  ve performed as cardinal sebastin . petrus antonius  general rodrguez  was also a bad choice for a  latin police officer  . it was so funny seeing elizondo and petronius in general rodrguez  s office . they looked like two english or american students in a spanish class  making their best effort in order to pronounce spanish . unsuccessfully  of course . castulo guerra was better in his spanish . a  peruvian  officer  who announced cardinal sebastin  spoke a quite funny spanish too . there are very good peruvian actors  like augusto alvarez  caldern and christian meier  just to mention two out of many peruvian actors   who could  ve performed with excellence .  . i admit that a fictional movie can let itself a license inventing cities or  even  countries . but  please  when creating a name  be careful when using a foreign language the town portrayed in this movie should  ve been called  vicente  and not  viciente  . vicente is a male name  and viciente has never been used .  . i disagree one user  who says that this movie was filmed on locations in per . not one location is peruvian  although the production has used in excess posters showing  inca kola   the peruvian soda . as not few american films  this one must have used any latin country . after all  for american producers or directors  a latin place is identical to any other latin place .  . in the first scenes  when john  matthew settle  flies to per  he  s supposed to arrive to the only one international airport in per jorge chvez airport  in lima  the capital  . actually  believe me  it must be any airport in the world  but peruvian airport . and  of course  in peruvian airports there are no military or police guards .  . when this john takes a room in a peruvian hotel  this one has a fan and  obviously has no air conditioner . please  this doesn  t happen in no hotel in per  and other latin countries   unless you get a  star hotel    . the rebels who fight against the government are . . . colombians  their accent was  with no doubt  from colombia . for casting them  the producers should  ve hired peruvian actors . in few words  it would  ve been cheaper filming in per .  br    br   i could go on with more examples out of this film  that led me to give it a     awful  vote  but i fell asleep after about   minutes from its beginning . but dear producers it  s not a tragedy there are many worse movies with not few mistakes . just let  s remember  indiana jones and the kingdom of the crystal skull  and indescribable disney  s  the emperor  s new groove  . the list of bad films could be endless . . .  ,0
this movie starts slow  then tapers off . after watching for about an hour  and seeing absolutely nothing happen  i walked out . i mean  nothing happened . zero . zip . nada . there is no story . the characters are vague representations of the most boring people any of us know . the producers of this film could be sued in a court of law if they try to sell it as a  motion  picture . there is no motion . i could have told the same  story  with a couple still pictures with captions . the script is a joke . it  s just awful . i doubt that any script doctor in the world could save it . my biggest regret is not that i wasted   minutes of my life watching  love in the time of money   but that i missed a great opportunity to be a leader . i could have been the first to walk out  but i waited a bit too long . instead  i watched about   people walk out before me .  ,0
as it is often the case  the impressive and explosive trailers of asian films add up to nothing more than lackluster stories . similar to unleashed  which was great   dog bite dog tells a story where men are raised as ferocious savage dogs that carry out their master  s bidding . the main characters  an emotionally undeveloped  amoral killer who is matched against an equally unstable police officer  are far from the common heroes and villains we often see . in fact  by the end  you lose track of who you  re supposed to empathize with  failing to feel even the slightest emotion for either of the men  whether that was the failure of the director or perhaps the underlining message he was trying to tell is up to you to decide .  br    br   although the beginning of the film was filled with intrigue and unpredictability  by the half  way point it slopped down to a humdrum story of survival and revenge . the suspense which was evident at first soon disappeared because of a grossly mismatched music score which brought down the potentially effective story telling . and in the end  you were left feeling that all that detailed background information and introspection of the main characters was somehow very unnecessary .  br    br   on the plus side  the transition in story from point a to point b was quite atypical compared to us movies  so those who aren  t familiar with asian films and are tired of hollywood  s predictability should check it out .  br    br   the white balance seemed off throughout most of the film . it was like looking into a picture shot on fluorescent when it was supposed to be set on tungsten . maybe i  m the only one  but it strained my eyes .  br    br   the movie also enjoyed playing tricks on you  an interesting build  up gave me hope for the slow moving story until it was diverted to a low budget  low speed chase scene . and just when you think you were going to get an unanswered indie ending with a mix of shakespearean tragedy  you realize that it  s not an ending at all  but rather a transition into a wacky country  music montage about peace and serenity .  br    br   throw in some grisly from  behind choke scenes  a moment of redemption unexpectedly brought back into savagery and back again the other way  asians  fascination with bodily fluids and a horrible music score that didn  t match the film  and you get the average bland asian thriller .  br    br   i just don  t get why every fight scene was overlaid with clips of roaring lions i thought they were supposed to symbolize dogs  ultimately  in the end  we are reminded about a true killer that still lurks amongst us  tetanus .  br    br        ,0
eyeliner was worn nearly     years ago in egypt . really not that much of a stretch for it to be around in the   th century . i also didn  t realize the series flopped . there is a second season airing now isn  t there  it is amazing to me when commentaries are made by those who are either ill  informed or don  t watch a show at all . it is a waste of space on the boards and of other  s time . the first show of the series was maybe a bit painful as the cast began to fall into place  but that is to be expected from any show . the remainder of the first season is excellent . i can hardly wait for the second season to begin in the united states .  ,1
this movie is by far the worst movie ever made . if you have to create a film costarring the guy who plays lars in heavyweights than don  t make the damn film . i have to say that i could watch leprechaun in space  times before i could watch the trailer for this pos of a movie . adam sandler should be restricted from any movie after this disgrace . watching this movie is like a mix of listening to cher and willingly putting your dick in a blender . anyone with half of a brain cell will realize that this movie is not worth a dime . if i had an extra dollar and had to spend it  i  d give it to the support lorraina bobbitt foundation before buying this movie .  ,0
i can safely admit  as an imdb geek  that  phantom lady  will never crack into my film noir top twenty . it may not even sneak into the top fifty . but rather than discredit the film for not being as good as so many other classics of the film noir genre  it should be noted that  phantom lady  has enough strong and lasting images in it to make it a worthwhile viewing . all that is required from the viewer is the ability to get beyond the dreadfully slow beginning .  br    br   the film doesn  t get cooking until  kansas   ella raines  sets about trying to prove all but single handedly the innocence of her boss  scott anderson  alan curtis   who has been convicted of murder .  kansas  is anderson  s secretary by day and amateur detective by night . as the novice sleuth she does quite well for herself while working the streets of new york at night . little by little she starts putting pieces of a murder mystery puzzle together . to be honest  the film belongs to raines and it is only due to her presence that the film works well at all . somehow she is able to breathe life into a film about a condemned man who is not interesting in the slightest . i  m not sure if this splintered dynamic of a characterless leading man becomes the fault of the actor or the director  but clearly this is where something becomes terribly wrong with the film .  br    br   as interesting as raines is as a novice detective  things really accelerate into another hidden gear when  kansas  pays a late night visit to a wandering drummer  elisha cook  jr .  in search of some information to help her condemned boss . she and the drummer paint the town a new kind of red while visiting the  all night  jazz clubs . trying to describe this scene will either prove an injustice to the scene or worse yet  it could ruin the scene all together . you  ll know the scene once the last cymbal crash has finished ringing out . if you  re lucky enough to have this film on dvd  you  ll more than likely be rewinding this scene again and again . as good as raines is  it is this scene that makes this film noteworthy . it is mainly because of this scene that i rate  phantom lady  a  instead of a  .  br    br   for the most part this film comes off as tepid and bland with a few great scenes and one magnificent scene . it is the  drum  sex scene  that separates this film from any others of the same ilk .  br    br   and just like it is said in the film that  you never go wrong with vanilla   i would also like to add that  going with vanilla  is the safe fall back choice when one can  t decide on having a tastier treat .  br    br       . clark richards  ,1
this is a film about life  the triumph over adversity and the wonders of the human spirit . i defy anyone not to shed a tear by the end of the movie . this is more than just a tear  jerker  its an engaging  thought  provoking drama with excellent performances from all the cast but especially derek luke and denzel washington .  years on  i  m amazed that luke is still a virtual unknown and washington only directed one other film . nevertheless  apart from a slow build  up  the story of this foster child  s trials and tribulations and how it still affects him in adulthood is the sort of movie that stays with you long after you have seen it . like many fox searchlight pictures  this was more of a sleeper hit and didn  t get the mass critical acclaim it deserves . the scene where antwone finally meets his mother summed up the movie for me  there were so many ways that could have been done and it could have been all schmaltzy or it could have been unrealistic but washington struck exactly the right tone  his mother never said a word and could only shed a tear  while antowne asked simply why . her overwhelming guilt prevented her from saying anything  what could she say to defend herself  one of the most moving cinematic scenes i have seen .  ,1
wow  could have been such a good movie  starts of with brittany daniels tied up  im thinking cool we are going to get a flash back  but nothing  movie starts anew with the kid filming . this movie probably would have been better if it wasn  t for the acting . i mean the acting was mostly horrible . . although with the lines the poor actors had to deal with i guess they did the best they could . . still it really ruin the movie for me . . the twins were the only ones that seem to have some acting skills . . the movie drags to long for the supposed shocking conclusion . . all in all i have seen worse low budget movies but considering this was hype with the  films to die for i was very disappointed . . by the way  were did some reviewers say there was gore and stuff . did i see the same movie . . well this is  out of the eight  and so far only one has been any good . .  ,0
it  s a shame this movie is so hard to get your hands on in the us . i found it through a rare video dealer  and it was certainly worth it . this is  without a doubt  the best film made during the pre  code era  and the finest film of the     s . masterful director frank borzage made wonderful films about the depression  and with man  s castle he created a fairy tale amidst the hardships of the era .  br    br   loretta young and spencer tracy have a wonderful chemistry between them  and they help make this movie a wonderful romance . young  s trina is sweet and hopeful  while tracy  s bill is gruff and closed  off . the dynamic between the character creates one of the most difficult  but in the end rewarding relationships on film .  br    br   man  s castle is the most soft  focus pre  code film i  ve seen . borzage uses the hazy and dreamy technique to turn the squatter  s village where bill and trina live into a palace . the hardships of the depression are never ignored  in fact they  re integral to the film . but as borzage crafts the film as a soft focus fairy tale  the love between the characters makes the situation seem less harsh . it makes the film warm and affectionate .  br    br   man  s castle is the crowning achievement of the pre  code era . if only more people could see it .  ,1
very funny film . classic film funny eddie murphy of the   s . i saw when i was a child and i have a good memory . the classic irony of murphy does not fail  the film is funny  well done . murphy in the    s made many films of action that represented for him a way to joke about everything that is dangerous . the result can only be appreciated by some but ii film from     up to now have changed . the atmosphere for a movie of that time is good and the special effects are good for a film of the period . a nice movie to see and enjoy appreciating the taste of ironic murphy  an actor who has recently disappeared . the final part is anthologies  the likable actor who plays the part of the tibetan monk . that  s it .  ,1
horrible ending  and i can  t believe moore spent a year coming up with it . smacks of l . ron hubbard and dianetitcs  which hubbard claimed to pen in just three weeks . this was actually disappointing enough for me to toss my discs from the first  .  years . now  the first  .  hours were action packed  though absurd in the premise  and then it deteriorated into a slow  painful  sophomoric dissolution of the series . unbelievable how slow and drawn out that last hour was . were we to think more deeply  if i wanted a lesson in a  materialism  i would reread daniel quinn  s ishmael . absurd to think   k people would give up everything for a  fresh start  . absurd to throw in a disappearing kara  and a reappearing baltar and six . absurd to throw in the mitochondrial eve . just absurd .  ,0

this film is just another distortion  among many distortions  on the so  called  sins of consumerism  . please note that  reverend billy   an actor  bill talen   is nothing more than a bureaucrat against the  sins of consumerism  . we might want to ask are questions  like what does  reverend billy  do for a living  how does he make his money  does he make his living off his  tax  deductible  organization  how does the internal revenue justify this as a  tax  deductible  church or organization   br    br   everyone knows that christmas is commercialized  but it affords one day out of a whole year in which people have an opportunity to be charitable  and allows a significant number of people to spend time with their families  friends  or extended families . everyone is not charitable . everyone does not spend time with their families  friends  or extended families . but  holidays and vacation time give people that chance and opportunity . yes  america does have more than its share of problems   but  with perseverance  americans have and always make it through great difficulties . and  even in times of strife  america has proved itself to be the greatest country in the world . that happens when americans pull together and unite  rather than to separate and divide . yes  there are problems with corporations and monopolies  but it will take americans to bring back the small businesses  along with the ethics to responsibly care for people living in our individual communities . yes  globalization has brought us its share of problems  but it will take americans to bring production back to america . americans and the u . s . government need to learn how to stay on a budget  no matter how large or small it may be  and we must stop our dependence on credit . our over  reliance on credit will make  and keep us poor  from the cradle to the grave . it is important to buy   but  if we buy less  we will rely less on credit . and  if we are able to save  even a small amount of money  we will have money for a rainy day . not to say that  as americans  we will gain an equal share of wealth . wealth is not guaranteed  and has never been guaranteed . but  stratification teaches us that only a small percentage of americans hold most of america  s wealth . there is a good proximity that you or i can reach the level of the upper  middle class . and  who knows what can happen from there    be positive  work hard   and  at the very least  you and i will be able to reach at least some  if not all  of our dreams . in life  nothing is guaranteed  but we always have that something to reach for . and  if you or i don  t have dreams  we might as well be dead . in america  there is always room for plenty of hopes and dreams . as individuals  we are a part of the pack  but we always can become the leader of the pack .  br    br   it has always been my experience that churches and religion do offer nothing more than additional distortions  but i pay dignity and give respect to people with other beliefs  values  and perspectives . but  as far as the distortions expressed  within this film  i do not have any faith in such beliefs  values  and perspectives . i rank this film with a  out of     but  in all honesty and truth  this film deserves a zero . this film has no integrity  and i cannot recommend it .  ,0
i got all excited when i saw the ads for this movie because i recently read the book and really enjoyed it . the movie  however  did not meet my expectations . having read the book recently prepared me for big let down as often happens when stories are translated into movies . the characters didn  t seem to fit very well with the book . the direction was weak . i had a hard time getting into the characters . there wasn  t a real connection with the viewer about what was going on . the dialog didn  t explain adequately what was happening . it just seemed slapped together and rushed through . all in all i was very disappointed with the movie . i suppose if you haven  t read the book  it might be ok by itself . at the very least  it might entice you to read the book  which you  ll probably enjoy more .  br    br    ,0
if you like horror movies with lots of blood and gore  tons of jump  scare moments and unrelenting  escalating scenes of excruciating death  then look elsewhere . if you like quiet  moody  thoughtful horror which casts blood aside in favor of a genuine feeling of dread  then wendigo is for you .  br    br   thoughtful  stressed out george  his psychoanalyst wife kim and their young son miles are heading out to the snowy countryside for a long weekend vacation away from the city . on the way up  george hits a stag with his car . the hunters who had been pursuing the deer are not thrilled when they find that george has ended their chase . in particular  deranged hunter otis takes it personally . he follows the family to their vacation home  making sure they see him . he spies on george and kim as they have sex . he fires through their windows with his rifle when they aren  t home  letting them discover the ominous holes in their windows and walls when they return . when kim takes miles to the drugstore in town  miles is attracted to a small sculpture in a display case  carved to resemble a man with the head of a stag . a native american man tells miles that this is the wendigo  a spirit of the woods who has a taste for flesh and is always hungry . miles takes the figure home with him  already haunted by the death of the deer the day before . that afternoon  when he and his father go sledding  george is shot and miles pursued through the woods by a creature barely glimpsed . . . or is he just in shock  and imagining the whole thing  hours later  george is rushed to the hospital and miles  still clutching his statue  either faints  dreams or goes on a vision quest  in which the wendigo returns . this time the angry  flesh eating god  part tree  part stag and part man  is hunting for otis  who has finally gone over the edge .  br    br   wendigo is a beautifully made film  almost totally silent but for the wind howling through the snow covered trees . okay  so the monster itself is kind of fakey  looking  but it  s a small flaw  more than made up for by the genuine feeling of tension and dread that creeps through every frame of the film  and the eerie backdrop of the silent  snowy countryside . the performances are great  particularly by jake weber as the moody and thoughtful george and patricia clarkson as his sweet but no  nonsense wife . they are a happy couple with their share of common problems  and it is the strength of their relationship and their love for each other that makes this film powerful . watching this film is often like watching someone  s home videos  so realistic are the performances .  br    br   this movie is not for everyone . a lot of people may find themselves totally bored  waiting for the hideous lovecraftian beast and bloody revenge that never come . we can never really be sure if the wendigo even exists  seen as it is through the eyes of a sensitive child and also  later  through the eyes of a madman . this is more a psychological drama than a horror film  but it has more than enough creepy elements in it to satisfy fans of subtle horror .  ,1
go way back to page ten of this review section  and work your way back up . go ahead i  ll wait .  br    br   done  well  then you  ve probably noticed the same trend that i have . you could nitpick all day long about the lame jokes  dated timing and obviously derivative plot points and shtick in  bogus   but this movie seems to be one of those  hate me now  love me later  flicks .  br    br   bill and ted  s biggest problem was that the original appealed to those    s kids who followed the tends and considered themselves on the cutting edge of fashion . that worked fine for the original  but obviously bombed in      when no self  unrespecting slacker would be caught dead wearing anything but flannel or admitting he liked anything about the    s . as ted would put it  dude  this is a totally deep hole . wanna play   questions    br    br   they say nostalgia goes in   year cycles  and that certainly seems to be the case here . here in      those of use who grew up with cindi lauper and megadeth are beginning to look back to appreciate some of those pivotal films that  like it or not  made us who we are . if you  re one of those who look at  bogus  as if it were an outdated   fa gs    ripoff  then you  re missing the point and probably spent six years growing facial hair  wearing flannel and looking like you just crawled out of bed .  br    br   in self  referencing its own origins  the star trek episode  and and time traveling with a phone booth   bt makes no attempt to hide its creators  love for homage . quentin tarantino  anyone  i  m not saying  bogus  is  true love   but i do think it needs to be appreciated for what it is a fun snap  shot of our society at a time before child psychology  ritalin  anti  smoking ads  terrorist paranoia and the proliferation of media fear  mongering .  br    br   so  for all of you bt haters out there . . . turn off your screaming trees cd  get that hair out of your face  go to the beach and lighten up . narcissistic depression and intellectual ennui are so corporate .  ,1
creep   your journey terminates here .  some very graphic scenes and . . . well  yeah  that  s about all for this film .  br    br   no real plot  no storyline . no likable characters  well   characters  isn  t correct considering you don  t have a clue who anyone really is . i mean  they are being chased by some weird looking  thing  in the sewers  who is this thing  why is he there    that  s quite scary i guess  but do i really care  no  i don  t . why don  t i  because i don  t have a clue who these people are and i don  t know if i should want them to live or die . it  s one dimensional and relies upon gore and sound effects to scare you  which it rarely does .  br    br   this film lacks any meaning  any purpose . it feels like i fell asleep and missed out the   mins of build up . it jumps right into the action . basically  some women and her friends get locked in the london underground  get chased by a weird creature  then they eventually escape from it .  br    br   creep has its moments which make you jump  the art is good  the location is excellent and the sounds are ok  but that isn  t what makes a decent horror film  so unfortunately all that goes to waste .  br    br   it  s nothing new . another predictable modern  horror   where kate  the lead  character   consistently does the stupid  hey  i know you lot sitting at home think i should do the sensible thing in this situation  but  oooh no  i  m going to do the total opposite because i  m a dumb blond  thing . i wish they wouldn  t do that  it  s done so many times  it  s boring and gets predictable . in fact  i  m pretty annoyed the silly woman didn  t get stabbed by the  erm  grey alien  looking creature .  br    br    your journey terminates here  is the films tag line . well  creeps journey terminates only a short while into the film . if you  ve had a few beers  got a couple of mates back at yours  then sure  watch it by all means . but if you want something original and clever  avoid .  ,0
this is film that was actually recommended to me by my dentist  and am i glad he did  the blend of british humor  should i say  humour   and the reality of a lost  middle  aged widow trying to maintain her lifestyle were a hoot . add to that mix the reality of what it takes to actually grow pot  those plants under the bushes were not going to make it without the tlc they received   and it is a truly hilarious  yet touching film . i laugh every time i conjure the vision of all the bar patrons sitting in their lawn chairs with sunglasses on counting down the lights  maybe it  s just my mendocino county blood  but the brits definitely got this one right         ,1
if the myth regarding broken mirrors would be accurate  everybody involved in this production would now face approximately    years of bad luck  because there are a lot of mirrors falling to little pieces here . if only the script was as shattering as the glass  then  the broken  would have been a brilliant film . now it  s sadly just an overlong  derivative and dull movie with only just a handful of remarkable ideas and memorable sequences . sean ellis made a very stylish and elegantly photographed movie  but the story is lackluster and the total absence of logic and explanation is really frustrating . i got into a discussion with a friend regarding the basic concept and  meaning  of the film . he thinks ellis found inspiration in an old legend claiming that spotting your doppelganger is a foreboding of how you  re going to die . interesting theory  but i  m not familiar with this legend and couldn  t find anything on the internet about this  neither . personally  i just think  the broken  is yet another umpteenth variation on the theme of  invasion of the body snatchers  but without the alien interference .  the broken  centers on the american mcvey family living in london  and particularly gina . when a mirror spontaneously breaks during a birthday celebration  this triggers a whole series of mysterious and seemingly supernatural events . gina spots herself driving by in a car and follows her mirror image to an apartment building . whilst driving home in a state of mental confusion  she causes a terrible car accident and ends up in the hospital . when dismissed  gina feels like her whole surrounding is changing . she doesn  t recognize her own boyfriend anymore and uncanny fragments of the accident keep flashing before her eyes . does she suffer from mental traumas invoked by the accident or is there really a supernatural conspiracy happening all around her  writer  director sean ellis definitely invokes feelings of curiosity and suspense in his script  but unfortunately he fails to properly elaborate them .  the broken  is a truly atmospheric and stylish effort  but only after just half an hour of film  you come to the painful conclusion it shall just remain a beautiful but empty package . there  s a frustratingly high amount of  fake  suspense in this film . this means building up tension  through ominous music and eerie camera angels  when absolutely nothing has even happened so far . by the time the actually mysteriousness kicks in  these tricks don  t have any scary effect on you anymore . some of my fellow reviewers around here compare the film and particularly sean ellis  style with the repertoires of david lynch  stanley kubrick and even alfred hitchcock  but that is way  way  way too much honor . ps what is up with that alternate spelling the one with the scandinavian     ,0
takashi miike  s incursion into kiddie territory won me over almost immediately because he demonstrates nerve and bravery in dealing with fantasy elements . this is a fairy tale that dares to be dark . even as a kid  i thought that there was something sinister about most fairy tales horrible things happen to people in most children  s books . miike understands that these classic tales are a bit scarier  and more disturbing  than what they appear to be at first glance . the filmmaker takes the archetypical story of a kid on a wondrous quest out of the preschool classroom . he accentuates the very real fears of a world filled with never  ending hazardous missions . westerners like to downplay the seriousness behind bedtime stories written specifically for kids . i appreciated the fact that miike was more honest than most american filmmakers . he goes for the jugular of the story but he also shows signs of restrain . but a self  possessed miike is still stranger than most filmmakers . i thought it was a great film . highly recommended .  ,1
watched both parts twice . enjoyed the story and enjoyed seeing an older patrick swayze as the hero . he was very believable as the hunter alan quartermaine and certainly bested the performance of richard chamberlain . i do admit that i would have preferred seeing someone else as the  lady in distress  . alison doody should stick with modern and not period pieces . she didn  t have the look of the woman of the      s . the rest of the cast were terrific and followed the plotlines very well . i am glad to see that the actors of this generation are not afraid to try on different characters and are not afraid to be seen as getting older . age is inevitable  but let  s not hide from it . a man at    can be much sexier  and  patrick truly is sexy  then a green youth  no matter how pretty . hoorah for character lines to go along with a great smile .  ,1
i watched this last night after not having seen it for several years . it really is a fun little film  with a bunch of faces you didn  t know were in it . arkin shines as always . check it out you won  t be dissappointed . by the way  it was just released on dvd and contrary to its packaging  it is widescreen . the transfer is rather poor  but at least the whole movie is visible .     ,1
i like musicals but as a dickens fan i hate this one . mild spoilers starving boys who have enough energy to sing and dance in the workhouse  the poor of london coming out to sing  fagin and dodger walking off into the sunset  not exactly faithful to the novel . as i recall  dodger was publicly hanged and fagin went crazy in prison . end of spoilers  br    br   oliver reed is very weak as sykes  doing little more than growling to indicate his evil . worst however  is mark lester as oliver  who often comes across so awkward and passive you wonder if he  s really the main character . his portrayal is in no way helped by the fact that the best they could do when he sings is dub in the voice of a girl . guess they didn  t realize that boy trebles can be found in almost every church in england .  br    br   self  respecting dickens fans stick to david lean  s amazing     film or the bbc   hour adaptation from the mid     s . avoid this bloated whitewash of a musical .  ,0
this is by the far worst piece of cr  p i  ve ever seen in my life . it barely made sense . it wasn  t scary at all  unless you class scary as loud noises and screaming   sarah  michelle gellar needs to stop with these sh  tty horror films . i think everyone else in the cinema agreed with me when i shouted  shite  when the credits rolled up .  br    br   on my list of the worst movies ever made this is how it would go  br    br    . the return  . cabin fever  . silent hill  br    br   the reason i made silent hill  rd is because it showed some frightening scenes  but the rest was absolute cr  p . same with cabin fever  made no sense  but the return topped that list . its worse than silent hill and cabin fever put together  ,0
i seriously love this film so much  i never get sick of watching it . the only line i really can  t stomach in this is when riff calls herself a teenage lobotomy but other than that  everything else is perfect . i  ve never been a fan of pj soles and it didn  t help to hear that she didn  t even know who the ramones were until she filmed this movie  but i can ignore her snarly little face for the most part . most people who watch this over and over are fans of the ramones and really . . that  s the only reason i love it so much . i never get tired of seeing deedee mess up his pizza lines or joey mess up the name of the teacher over and over  haha . one of the best parts of the film is seeing them sing do you want to dance  down the halls of the high school . . i love it . the special edition dvd has a good retrospective  surprisingly pj soles isn  t on it . maybe she was working on another project laugh anyway  great film  even better if you  re a ramones fan .  ,1
i was a bit scared to watch this movie due to its rates . but living in italy titles like this never ever come across and i love step so much that i decided to give it try . and how surprised i was  the story is different from any other dance  movie i  ve seen lately  with a deeper meaning than just  winning  . it  s touching and well written and well directed . raya is such a strong character  i love the fact that she never doubts herself  she  s so mature and focused and aware of her talent  and what talent rutina wesley has  my jaw dropped in the final dance scene  . the way she pursues her dream and refuses to let anything stop her is  honestly  inspiring . also  the fact that she  s not the typical super  hot chick  see jessica alba  briana evigan  jenna dewan  zoe seldana . . .  makes her really appealing and real . seriously  why is this movie rated so low  you can understand between the first  minutes that it  s a good work . really good actually . i even cried at the end of the movie . and the dancing routines are just sick .  ,1
i just saw this film tonight and i have to say that it  s a mess . i love vince vaughn but he ends up more annoying that funny here and the film is more than less a remake of the crappy    s classic  santa claus the movie  but with out the camp or the bad sheena easton song at the end . . the story is your run of the mill black sheep in the family who comes back to face his family for the holidays kind of thing but with north pole as its setting . of course fred  vince vaughn  is the family screw up who comes home after a series of set backs that include his girlfriend  rachel weisz in a cameo role  dumping him  so he comes home to face his parents and his more successful brother santa claus  paul giamatti  and wacky high jinks follow with a bit of sibling rivalry and a bit of anarky as well that threatens all of christmas . now if you think you know the ending of this film  i think you would be right because it  s predicable to the hill . as for the acting  vince vaughn plays the same lovable loser he always plays but this time he ends up more annoying than likable  miranda richardson plays mrs . claus but the role is more than less one note  elizabeth banks plays santa  s assistant but she  s not much of a character at all other than a neurotic joke and poor kevin spacey ends up basically playing the same person he plays in the film  glengarry glen ross  but a little more anal . the only two actors who come out of this film with their dignity intact is paul giamatti  who brings a real sincerity and warmed to his role as santa claus but he looks somewhat embarrass to be in the movie and you can  t blame him and rachel weisz  who manages to do a lot more with a very small role than most of the main actors do with theirs  which is a shame because both rachel weisz and paul giamatti deserved a lot better than what this script gave them .  br    br   to put it in a nutshell  a major disappointment .  ,0
watching this film for the action is rather a waste of time  because the figureheads on the ships act better than the humans . it  s a mercy that anthony quinn couldn  t persuade anyone else to let him direct any other films after this turkey .  br    br   but it is filled with amusement value  since yul brynner has hair  lorne greene displays an unconvincing french accent  and the rest of the big names strut about in comic  book fashion .  ,0
other reviewers have summarized this film noir well . i just wanted to add to the  whew   comment one reviewer made regarding elisha cook  s obviously coke  fuelled drumming episode . this was a doozy  i must say . cook deserved some acclaim for his frenzied performance .  br    br   a bit of trivia that i am surmising about cook appeared as a waiter in the     barbara stanwyck film   ball of fire .  he was a waiter in the nightclub where barbara was singing and legendary drummer gene krupa was drumming  most energetically . is it too much to suggest that cook  s spazzy drumming in the later film   phantom lady   was very much inspired by krupa  s work  as witnessed by cook  years earlier   br    br   if you watch krupa in  ball of fire   i think you  ll note some clearly similar body movements . one hopes  of course  that he was not influenced by any drugs at the time   ,1
the film was very outstanding despite the nc    rating and disturbing scenes . in reality things like this do happen and that is why this movie shows a lot of it . it all starts with maya  rosario dawson in superb performance  whose recently started attending college has everything going well for her . she meets jared  chad faust in a terrific performance  at a frat party who turns out to be a real gentleman and sweet . he invites her out to dinner . they look at the stars from a bridge and they end going to his apartment . they talk and takes her to the basement were they become flirtatious with each other . she tries to put an end to it  but he rapes her . this incident scars her . she goes to a club meets a bartender  dj adrian  greatfully played by marcus patrick  who sees that she is getting to drunk and helps before she goes to far . they strike a friendship . he also does drugs and maya starts using as well . in other words introduces her to a different world . she starts going back to school and working as ta  teaching assistant  and spots jared as one of the students . while the students are taking a midterm  she catches jared cheating . jared tries to smooth talk maya  but she still has the upper hand decides to invite him to her place . will history repeat itself  or will maya have a surprise for jared  you watch the movie . excellent a . rosario dawson portrays the role with focus and endurance . chad faust does not like he can be a rapist  but he does a terrific job as jared . marcus patrick is very brilliant the man who saves maya and coaches her into a new world . this film deserves an award .  ,1
i  ve seen this movie and i must say i  m very impressed . there are not much movies i like  but i do like this one . you should see this movie by yourself and comment it  because this is one of my most favorite movie . i fancy to see this again . action fused with a fantastic story . very impressing . i like modesty  s character . actually she  s very mystic and mysterious  i do like that  . the bad boy is pretty too . well  actually this whole movie is rare in  movieworld  . i considered about the vote of this movie  i thought this is should be a very popular movie . i guess wrong . it was me who was very impressed about this movie  and i hope i  m not the only one who takes only the cost to watch this one . see and vote .  ,1
i can  t believe anyone thought there was anything original or interesting about this movie . i  m a fan of science fiction as much as the next guy  and i can enjoy even old movies with ridiculous premises as long when they are written by someone other than a monkey .  see  for example  my glowing review of altered states       .   br    br   a monkey could have explained better exactly why i should for a second take seriously the basic idea behind this movie . the problem is not that the producers had a low budget   it  s that they didn  t care .  br    br   now  to publicly humiliate the worthless magazines whose glowing reviews appear on the box  br    br   chicago tribune  br    br   san francisco chronicle  br    br   san francisco bay guardian  br    br    actually  i enjoy reading the latter two . still  their movie reviewing credibility has gone through the floor . but i know if i ever make a movie with handheld camera  a cheesy plot and stupid effects  i  ll show it to these journalists and remind them what they said about conceiving ada .   ,0
like many of you i am a great fan of the real thing  the     s noir films  but red rock west was a real treat for all of us longing for the past . the term  neo  noir  has been so often used inappropriately in the last ten years that it has lost its meaning and its impact . john dahl  s film on the other hand  truly deserved to be described as such . the casting is perfect all around and would have felt right at home with tay garnett or jacques tourneur . the plot is so tight that you are hooked within the first fifteen minutes . james m . cain would have appreciated it . many contemporary films leave me wondering why they don  t make them like they used to  and i  m not even that old . movies such as red rock west give us hope for the future while paying tribute to the past .  ,1
i love sabrina  its one of my fave shows   my favourite episodes are the one where she turns libby into a geek  the first episode  the true love episode and most of the rest from the first series . i do think the college episodes were not as good as the high school ones but they were better than the last series which was awful . valerie was a good character as she was more rounded than jenny  but jenny was in some brilliant episodes . hilda and zelda were amazing  and there seemed to be no explanation for where they went  libby was a good character too . i never liked morgan or roxy  they just weren  t as good as her other friends .  ,1
the message of a world on the brink of war is disregarded by the masses the mythical city of everytown in     represents england in general  but it could just as well stand for any nation of the world . when war finally does arrive  it  s ravages continue not for another five years  but until     at which time everytown is completely destroyed . adding to the desolation and toll on humanity is the  wandering sickness   a pestilence that continues for another four years .  br    br    things to come  balances both a fatalistic and futuristic world view  where science holds out a hope for a revived civilization . the  wings over the world  concept plays out a bit corny  though it  s spokesman cabal  raymond massey  is unwavering in his mission and dedicated to his cause . if he fails  others will follow . this message is continually reinforced throughout the film  brought home convincingly in massey  s end of movie speech . man  s insatiable need to test the limits of knowledge and achievement requires an  all the universe or nothing  mindset .  br    br   the film  s imagery of automation and machinery in the second half is reminiscent of the great silent film  metropolis  . as everytown is rebuilt and transformed by the year      the spectacle of the city  s rebirth strikes a resonant chord  as architecture of modern cities of today suggest the movie  s eerily prophetic vision is coming to fruition . where the movie gets it wrong by sixty seven years though is man  s first mission to the moon  but in      a hundred year timetable probably seemed more legitimate than     .  br    br    things to come  is one of those rarities in film  a picture that makes you think . which side will you come down on  the forces for advancement in the face of uncertainty or maintain the status quo  it  s not a comfortable question  as both choices offer inherent dangers and unknowable outcomes . those who choose to be bystanders risk being swept away by forces beyond their control .  ,1
uneven bollywood drama . karisma kapoor is excellent as an indian woman in canada who marries a friend  sanjay kapoor   has a child  and then visits his family in india only to find they are terrorist warlords . drama and tragedy ensue  and the film becomes a kind of not without my baby styled thriller . film is compelling  its few song  dance numbers are uninteresting and needless  the gaity of bollywood song and dance is really out of character for the intensity of this film  s drama  at least once we  ve left the comforting confines of their canadian love nest  although one number involving a cameo by the stunning aishwarya rai is enjoyably provocative  if ultimately misplaced as well . likewise  the inclusion of bollywood superstar shahrukh khan as a happy  go  lucky drifter who helps kapoor in her escape from the clutches of the warlord turns what had been a very serious drama into a silly farce  and it only gets back on his feet when his character  and his fantasies about rai that generate her cameo dance  are dispensed with . his throw  away comic  book dialog and the silliness of his fight scenes detract from the film  s primary gripping drama . the cast is nicely supported by nana patekar as the warlord  and the elegant deepti naval who is outstanding as his long  suffering wife who finally choses to stand up against him in one of the film  s best scenes ritu shivpuri and rajshree solanki are also very good as sanjay  s sisters in india  and very pleasing eye candy . but sanjay himself overacts terribly  especially during obvious ad  libs . the directorial style of writer  director krishna wamsi is sloppy  rampant with rough transitions and abrupt cuts  although his camera movement is good . the musical underscore is also quite effective  moody  featuring wordless female voice over a small orchestral ensemble  too bad little if any of that made it onto shakti  s soundtrack cd  but bollywood hasn  t yet discovered the value of including score along with songs on their soundtrack albums  at least not in most cases  . but shakti is karisma kapoor  s film  all the way  though  and the intensity of her performance once the film switches to india contrasts nicely with the gentle romance with which she engaged with sanjay in the initial canadian scenes . despite the unevenness of much of the picture  karisma  s performance completely sells the film and solidifies its otherwise inconsistent measures . in a strange way  also  i found the story to be another take on the ostentation of royalty i  d noticed in curse of the golden flower and marie antoinette  both of which i  d seen just prior  although shakti of course is an entirely different kind of film but the focus on a dysfunctional royal family  here living in the austerity of terrorism  controlled poverty in india rather than the elegance of versailles or the massive megalomania of feudal china  s tang dynasty  whose self  serving seeking of power brings ruin upon many others and forces an uprising of one kind or another provides the film with a notable subtext .  ,1
this film  though  critically acclaimed  has of course not yet been released in the u . s . on dvd  like another great  christine lahti  s  housekeeping   out the same year . but if you can support region   australian  dvd  s  this little masterpiece should be in your collection . there are still some vhs copies available on the internet as well . davis is complemented by a great story  as well as memorable performances from her supporting cast  especially claudia carvan and the late  great jan adele . amazingly  or maybe not  this film and its stars went unacknowledged at academy awards time  as did  housekeeping   but treat yourself to both of them  you will be glad you did   ,1
i was also on hand for the premiere in toronto . this film was sort of a consolation when i thought i wouldn  t be able to get in to see my first choice . well  i was totally blown away . by the time i got to the theater i could remember little other than the basic plot of the movie  yes  i actually forgot who was even in it .  terrific performances from the entire cast . carrie  anne moss was great in a true departure from her days as trinity . as for billy connolly  i think not since chaplin has an actor played so brilliantly with no lines what  so  ever . the kids were also great . definitely check this one out if you get the chance .  br    br   and  by the way  i got to see my first choice anyway  and this was way better .  ,1
a female country singer nicknamed  big t    seriously  that  s what they call her   risks her budding musical career and her life by falling into the company of a sleazy drunkard  busey  who wants to be her manager . his mother committed suicide  his father  s an alcoholic as well  and he has a violent temper . you can imagine where that leads . in the meantime  there  s music aplenty  as parton  with her fluid vocal talents  belts out song after song  at least half a dozen of them about texas  . steer clear of this mess and check her out in nine to five or steel magnolias instead .  ,0
this was a superb episode  one of the best of both seasons . down right horror for a change  with a story that is way way above the average moh episodes  if there is such a thing . a man  s wife is almost burned to death in a tragic car wreck  in which he was driving . his airbag worked  her  s didn  t . she is burned beyond recognition  great makeup btw   and not given much of a chance to live without a full skin graft . but  even in a coma  she keeps dying but brought back by modern technology  and when she does die for a few minutes  her ghost appears as a very vengeful spirit . carnage of course ensues  and also some extremely gory killings  and also  some extremely sexy scenes . what more could you ask for  you might ask  well  not much  because this baby has it all  and a very satirical ending  that should leave a smile on most viewers faces . i just loved rob schmidt  s  wrong turn  direction too  he has a great knack for horror . excellent episode  this is one i  m buying for sure .  ,1
when thinking of the revelation that the main character in  bubble  comes to at films end  i am reminded of last years  machinist  with christian bale . the only difference between the two films is the literal physical weight of the characters .  br    br   an understated  yet entirely realistic portrayal of small town life . the title is cause for contemplation . perhaps  we  the audience are the ones in the  bubble  as we are given no payoffs in the films slim   minute running time . audience reactions were often smug and judgmental  clearly indicating how detached people can be from seeing any thread of humanity in characters so foreign to themselves . these characters are the ones people refer to as those that put george w . back in office for a second term .  br    br   it  s sobering to consider how reality television has spoiled our sense of reality when watching an audience jump to their feet for the exit as soon as the credits role . this film has it  s merits  and is deserving of consideration for the things it doesn  t say outright .  ,0
my roommates  i nearly shorted out our tv from the numerous spit  takes we did while watching this hilarious piece of     s self important pseudo  zen dreck . i  d read about this campfest for ages and scanned my local late night tv listings for years in search of this elusive turd . several years ago our local abc affiliate was known for showing cool flicks for its late night weekend flick  ie  frogs    night of the lepus   etc  . then one day it happened at     am on a saturday night  over  years ago  there it was  we had over   folks over and the flick did not disappoint   br    br   see  andy griffith as the silliest  most unthreatening bad guy since jaye davidson in  stargate    br    br   see  william shatner sport a variety of things atop his head that only faintly resemble human hair  or anything organic for that matter  .  br    br   hear  jaw droppingly inane     s psychobabble that makes  chicken soup for the soul  sound like bf skinner  br    br   feel  content that any decade was better than the   s .  br    br   for those still reading . . . the plot surrounds a bunch of middle class mid level a   holes who decide to suck up to their s    head boss  griffith  by joining him on a cross dessert race that spans california  mexico . they all wear leather jackets  looking more christopher street than anything else . along the way they stop at a cantina  get drunk  smoke joints  the sight robert  mike brady  reed smoke a joint is an image you won  t soon forget   start a fight  attempt rape  and just act like a bunch of suburban middle class jack offs . although i have an excellent copy that i taped off tv i wish this one would be released on video so the whole world could enjoy its half baked goofiness .  ,0
this is a refreshing  enjoyable movie . if you enjoyed   four weddings and a funeral    peter  s friends   etc .  you will see a number of familiar and talented actors . made me laugh  made me sad . i view movies for entertainment  and english  set movies generally fit that bill for me . enjoy   ,1
 . . . for one of the worst swedish movies ever . . . forgive me for being dull .  br    br   first of all i haven  t seen the first one  i was bored that  s my reason for watching the  nd before the  st one   well i hope the first one is better than this  it was filled with weird cut scenes and very strange plot changes  for the people that have seen this and think     is high  belive me so do i   but it made me laugh a few times  because it was so bizarre so bad and i still laugh thinking of the punk that came up with this idea  what  s next  det sjunde inseglet ii  . sequels not based on novel or book doesn  t turning out great to often  and this is a perfect example of one .  br    br   ok i  m gonna be honest with you i did laugh a bit  it got a few decent jokes in it and slapstick humor . but don  t buy it  rent it . just let some other idiot do it or download it .  br    br       this movie will be remembered and the director is probably laughed out already . . .  ,0
im watching it now on pink  serbia tv station  and i must say this is a crap . shallow  no acting  effects too sloppy i mean  who made this series   br    br   this was a stupid attempt of the studios to make some more money on the success of the film . ok . the film was great in     when it came out . but the series   br    br   some times you can see how idiotic the lines are in the speech of the characters . i mean  did they actually pay someone to write that  was that someones relative at the studio  this is no scifi .  br    br   the film was the bomb  the series suck .  ,0
  nobody knows anybody  is a conspiracy theory thriller about a satanist  nut bomber targeting the religious festivities of seville during holy week . he also happens to be the best friend of the film  s hero . the plot is set up by the bomber as a computer game  with himself and the hero as players  and seville as the virtual environment . the very real alleys and streets of the city begin to take on the labyrinthine qualities of those old pacman  type games . looked at this way  the scene where the hero and his female sidekick are chased by black  hooded penitents with rayguns may not seem as silly as it plays .  br    br   from the start  we are aware that the narrative is being constructed as a game  the hero  s job is to create crossword puzzles for a popular newspaper at one point  the crossword grid on his screen becomes the chessboard on which he is later playing against his girlfriend  s father . clues are liberally scattered  as the camera mystifyingly closes in on images that are only later shown to have been significant  e . g . the advert in the bar  . the detective  paper chase elements are made part of a game in progress  rather than an investigation after the fact . the film borrows heavily on  se  en   s pattern narrative  and anyone with a catholic education will presumably get the significance of certain events happening on certain days in the run up to easter .  br    br   in this reading  the game is on the level of narrative  with the hero fighting against an enemy  in this case  the computer  to win and save the day . but there is a second game  the film itself  which subvert the first . there are another set of of clues which point not to the killer  s intentions  but the filmmaker  s and his hero  s . in the first ten minutes there are references to chess  a writer called navokov and a cult leader called sarin . if we remember that the chess  loving nabokov  s     s pseudonym was sirin  we see another game afoot  one where we suspect not the villain  but the hero himself .  br    br   in a nabokov novel like  pale fire   an author  figure creates a text which is designed to hide his own motives  provoking a game between writer and reader to uncover the real text . throughout the film are scenes which are visually distorted  e . g . the image contracting   or which are ambiguously defined dreams and hallucinations that make us suspect the hero  s point of view . the opening references to games are all linked to him . in the early sequences  much is made of the character  s sexual and creative impotence  so the film could be his attempt to master his life  to be a winner  in a way he can  t for real . no sooner has he won the game than his writer  s block vanishes the words he types are the title of the film  suggesting he is the overall author . further  that title in spanish reflects on itself negatively  a very nabokovian involution that suggests a hero  like kinbote  trapped in his own solecism .  br    br   this jumble of post  modern literature  borges  eco  pynchon et al are alluded to also   fincher   x  files    run lola run   chris marker  the idea of the city and its history as a map and a text and as a cultural history haunting the present   bunuellian anti  clericism  and alex de la iglesia  s  shock  films result in a film that is just that  a jumble  each clever  clever allusive element cancelling out the last  dissipating interest . the lack of clarity about the game  s rules renders it incomprehensible  and eventually wearing .  br    br   ironically  in a work of such overdetermined artifice  the film  s main interest lies in its documentary quality  as a record of a narrative taking place in a real city with its own events taking place independently . such an ambiguous blurring of fact and fiction can create a masterpiece like  sans soleil  or  london   but  ultimately  you need to have a light touch to match your cleverness .  ,0
i  ve seen all four of the movies in this series . each one strays further and further from the books . this is the worst one yet . my problem is that it does not follow the book it is titled after in any way  the directors and producers should have named it any thing other than  love  s abiding joy .  the only thing about this movie that remotely resembles the book are the names of some of the characters  willie  missie  henry  clark  scottie and cookie  . the names  ages  genders of the children are wrong . the entire story line is no where in the book .  br    br   i find it a great disservice to janette oke  her books and her fans to produce a movie under her title that is not correct in any way . the music is too loud . the actors are not convincing  they lack emotions .  br    br   if you want a good family movie  this might do . it is clean . don  t watch it  though  if you are hoping for a condensed version of the book . i hope that this will be the last movie from this series  but i doubt it . if there are more movies made  i wish michael landon  jr and others would stick closer to the original plot and story lines . the books are excellent and  if closely followed  would make excellent movies   ,0
the plot was very thin  although the idea of naked  sexy  man eating sirens is a good one .  br    br   the film just seemed to meander from one meaningless scene to another with far too few nuddie  splatter  lesbian mouth licking shots in between .  br    br   the characters were wooden and one dimensional .  br    br   the ending made no sense .  br    br   considering it had tom savini and shaun hutson in it  you would have expected a decent plot and decent special effects . some of the effects were quite good but there were just too few of them .  br    br   brownie points go for occasional flashes of tits and bush  naturally  and of course the lesbian moments . i also thought that the scene with the sirens bathing in the pool under the waterfall could be viewed as an innovative take on the  shower scene   br    br   the film had many of the elements that go into making a first rate horror film but they were poorly executed or used too sparsely .  br    br   if i had been watching this alone and aged    i would have really enjoyed it for about   minutes  with  hand of the remote control   then lost interest suddenly and needed a pizza . . .  ,0
i was very disappointed in this     film based on a bernard malamud story . this is basically a story of possible redemption  racial bias and the unfulfillment of life based on mistrust .  br    br   a black jewish angel is sent to help a struggling tailor and his critically ill wife . if morris mishkin  zero mostel  will only believe in the angel  belafonte   his wife fanny  ida kaminska  will recover . the problem is that morris has basically given up on life and just refuses to believe that belafonte is an angel .  br    br   when he believes it  fanny improves but in the end he has doubts and fanny suffers accordingly . it would have been very nice if there had been an english translation in the last scene when a dying fanny speaks to morris .  br    br   jan kadar  who successfully directed miss kaminska in her oscar nominated brilliant performance in      s  the shop on main street  directs this film as well . kaminska is reduced in the film to mostly bed scenes and her kindness in her speech really doesn  t convey the desperate situation that she faces . she keeps calling for ruthie  their daughter  who disobeyed them by marrying out of the jewish religion . for most of the film  she does not realize the angel  s appearance in her apartment .  br    br   the scene in the pharmacy is muddled and the scene where the angel  s girl friend confronts belafonte in their apartment  is memorable but all too brief .  br    br   we don  t know why belafonte is in danger and why he has died .  br    br   those viewing this film must have left the theater in a state of depression and desperation .  ,0
given the low budget and production limitations  this movie is very good . it is plausible  realistic  and shows how the csikos  hungarian horsemen who lived on the plains  puszta  risked their lives to save a downed american pilot from the ruthless and savage nazis . we are drawn into strong feelings for the young  impressionable  yet highly courageous boy   who admires the american pilot . if you  re looking for special effects  superman heroes  and magical endings   this movie is not for you . if you want to feel what it must have been like to dodge the persistent  amoral nazis and their lack of compassion  then you will be enthralled by this movie . i truly enjoyed it and for those who love horses  dogs  and humble  helpful people who value freedom and those who aspire to that end  this movie will be one you  ll remember for a long time .  ,1
i was so surprised by how great the man in the moon truly was . i mean at first i was kinda expecting a cheesy  and predictable film  but i decided to put that aside when watching . well  when it was over i was just left stunned  mainly in tears   by how great the man in the moon turned out to be . this movie is so entertaining and is so aware of its tone  and its just a fabulous film . the acting was great especially from reece witherspoon  who was so cute and lovable   and everyone else . there wasn  t anything that really bothered me  i felt the ending kinda predictable  but very well done at that . also i felt some things to be plain or as if it had been done before  but still a great film . overall i must say i don  t to much to say about this film  not that it was bad  its just a film you either like or don  t like . i would however recommend this to any and everyone  even if you don  t like these type of films  its still an enjoyable film .  br    br    .  out of   stars  ,1
the first film was a nice one  but it is not as good as the wonderful animated classic which i found more poignant and endearing . this sequel is inferior  but not bad at all . sure the slapstick is too much  the script has its weak spots and the plot is a tad uninspired . but the dogs are very cute here  and eric idle is hilarious as the macaw . the film is nice to look at with stylish cinematography and eye popping costumes  especially cruella  s   and the music is pleasant . the acting is mostly very good  ioan gruffudd is appealing and gerard depardieu while he has given better performances has fun as cruella  s accomplice . but the best asset  as it was with the first film  is the amazing glenn close in a deliciously over  the  top performance as cruella  even more evil than she was previously . overall  nice .     bethany cox  ,1
truly a disgusting  vile film  with only a small amount of real humour .  br    br   the character of the father in particular is vulgar in the extreme  intentionally so  obviously   and portrayed in the most pathetic  seedy manner .  br    br   my wife and i found this film horribly upsetting  with absolutely no redeeming features at all . frankly  i wish i had never seen it .  br    br   i consider this british effort to be a sick and gross embarrassment .  br    br   those who enjoyed this film have an ability i totally lack that of rejoicing in a display of deep depravity and squalor .  br    br   the producers should be ashamed of themselves .  ,0
okay  so i get it . we  re supposed to be horrified . the idea has been planted . a girl is doing her dad and taking photos of it . call me over the shock  rock genre but i call for the explicit detailing of an act before i can fall for this . but don  t expect me to watch a soft  porn and become horrified that she is  doing her father  . . . i mean hasn  t that convention become a bit abused in the adult film industry already infiltrated with  rape  and molestation  porn . . . horror isn  t what your mind can fool you into believing . it is what actually exists in film . this is where miike fails in visitor q . extremism becomes mild when it becomes a choose your own adventure .  ,0
this film would usually classify as the worst movie production ever . ever . but in my opinion it is possibly the funniest . the horrifying direction and screenplay makes this film priceless . i bought the movie whilst sifting through the bargain dvd  s at my local pound shop . me and some friends then watched it  admittedly whilst rather drunk . it soon occurred that this wasn  t any normal film . instead a priceless relic of what will probably be james cahill  s last film . at first we were confused and were screaming for the dvd player to be turned off but thankfully in our abnormal state no  one could be bothered . instead we watched the film right through . at the end we soon realised we had found any wasters dream  something that you can acceptably laugh at for hours  whilst laughing for all the wrong reasons . we soon showed all our other friends and they too agreed  this wasn  t a work of abysmal film . this was a film that you can truly wet yourself laughing at . this was a film that anyone can enjoy . this was genius .  ,1
dark remains is a home run plain and simple . the film is full of creepy visuals  and scares  that will make the most seasoned horror veteran jump straight out of there seat . the staircase scene in particular  these guys are good . although they weren  t working on a huge budget everything looks good  and the actors come through . dark remains does have one of those interpretive endings which may be a negative for some  but i guess it makes you think . cheri christian and greg thompson are spot on as the grieving couple trying to rebuild there lives   however some side characters like the sheriff didn  t convince me . they aren  t all that important anyways . i give dark remains a perfect ten rating for being ten times scarier than any recent studio ghost story  japanese remake .  ,1
i saw this movie in the first couple of weeks it was out   i don  t remember exactly when .  i thought that it was alright  for a ben stiller movie . this movie isn  t for a person without a good sense of humor . like most of ben stiller  s jokes you have to think about them . or like i said you have a good sense of humor . from a couple of people on this website i saw that people didn  t have anything good to say about it and it didn  t get a very good rating  but i would have given it a larger one this movie  i thought  was very good and it should have gotten a better rating . maybe this isn  t a movie for you . i  m just giving you another person  s opinion .  ,1
this film is underrated . i loved it . it was truly sweet and heartfelt . a family who struggles but isn  t made into a dysfunctional family which is so typical of films today . the film didn  t make it an issue that they have little money or are dominican republican the way hollywood have .  br    br   instead the issue is victor is immature and needs to grow up . he does  slowly  by the film  s end . he has a ways to go  but it was a heartfelt attempt to move forward . his grandmother is very cute and the scene where the little boy throws up had me laughing for the longest time . a truly heartfelt indie  ,1
every movie from the thirties is dated  but if you were to watch only john ford movies it would seem more dated than if you watched others . i . e . grand hotel is comparatively modern melodrama . with ford  there  s always the hard  sell of someone  s nobility  abe  the joads  . always the over  emphasis of some heavy  s badness . always the poorly crafted  awkward and obvious scripts . this is no exception . it  s just a rather belabored device to deliver sentiment . and sentiment is all this has going for it .  br    br   what ford does here doesn  t make me appreciative of lincoln  it just makes me wonder how the states were ever settled by the population of complete morons depicted here . ford went on to make decent movies . this is too dated to be anything but bad . it feels entirely false .  br    br   henry fonda with a fake nose is bizarre . and no one from illinois would pronounce the trailing  s   or say  shonuff    ,0
i watched this with my whole family as a  year old in     on our black and white tv . i remember my father remarking that  this is how it could have happened  adam and eve .  i vividly remember the scene when adam finds eve  her eyes were blackened . i asked my father why were her eyes blackened and he told because she was tired and hungry . having not seen this episode in   years  i still remember it vividly  the tv transmissions back and forth with the home planet  scenes of bombs shaking the headquarters  with the final scene of the two walking off  adam carrying his pack and eve following . it may not have been a theatrical work of art  but it certainly left an impression on me all these years .  ,1
a very interesting entertainment  with the charm of the old movies . tarzan faces the greatest perils without hesitation if the moment requires it  and we all enjoy with him his success . the most insteresting for me is a man without special powers facing the problems and beating them just with human skills  he was a great swimmer and had a great shout   ,1
an unqualified    .  the level of writing and acting in this australian movie is reminiscent of the very best of  old  hollywood . sam neill and meryl streep are very good together . neill matches streep line for line  and take for take   it is one of the best showcases yet of his prodigious acting talent and he is at his sexy and gorgeous best  notwithstanding the intensity of his role . this engrossing film is a treat for any movie fan who loves a gripping courtroom drama  portrayed in the most human but unsentimental terms . the movie   which won several top awards in australia   boasts not only a superlative cast and director  but wonderful and authentic australian locales . it proves that people are the same the world over . and  after all these years  people still delight in repeating the famous streep line  accent and all  a dingo ate moy baby   including that imp  elaine benis  on  seinfeld .   ,1
i found the fbi story considerably entertaining and suitably upbeat for my new years day holiday viewing . its drama and action  packed episodes were thrilling . the hardesty character was well drawn and admirable . overall the photography  script and direction was perfectly creditable . rather than taking the film to be a repugnant piece of propaganda  as some might  i enjoyed it as a well mounted portrayal of the necessity of ingenious minds and brave bodies in the fight against crime . again  the depiction of a family holding together even under the strain of the husband  s commitment to his  arguably  important work  i did not find to be a twee representation but an ideal and exemplary one .  ,1
but if you like the muppets i defy you to dislike this one . basically the same plot regurgitated  this time new york  not la  it features a lot of fun cameos and muppet hi  jinx . a lot of the muppets leave the film pretty early on as it centers around kermy and miss piggy . i happened to have enjoyed it greatly . fun to watch with your kids .  ,1
after gorging myself on a variety of seemingly immature movies purchased on ex  rental dvds  i figured that the time was right for a little serious drama and who better to provide it than sam mendes  for a number of reasons   american beauty  doesn  t appeal to me as much as this film which is easily the darkest thing that tom hanks has ever done and probably one of the most underrated films of the last decade . for this is not a simple gangster tale lifted from its graphic novel origins  and is simply wonderful to watch because of it . and despite my usual allergy to any film with tom hanks  name on it  still can  t watch  big  without wanting a cat to kick   i  m glad i gave this a try because this is one of those movies that you  ll kick yourself for if you miss it .  br    br   normally squeaky  clean hanks plays michael sullivan  a devoted family man and father of two sons growing up during prohibition in the early      s . he is also a professional hit  man to mob boss john rooney  paul newman  but has managed to keep his job a secret from his sons . but after his eldest  tyler hoechlin  witnesses his dad involved in a mob killing  the pair are forced to go on the run as john seeks to tidy the matter up . soon  father and son are pursued to chicago where a fellow hit  man  a menacing jude law  is waiting for them .  br    br   on the face of it  it reads like a pretty standard gangster film but as i  ve said  this isn  t really about gangsters at all . it  s about the relationship between a father and son thrown together in the most tragic of circumstances . hanks is  grits teeth  superb as the tortured man who finds out that everything has its price and little hoechlin is also good as sullivan  s son . in all honesty  there is not a single performance that i could single out as weaker than the others  the cast is pretty much faultless . as is the cinematography and costumes  and it  s not often i praise costumes   which recreates the    s with stunning effect . there has been so much effort to get everything right and it pays off in spades . this could easily have looked rubbish  they admit that the early    s look was difficult to put down  but it doesn  t and that deserves every bit of credit . chicago especially looks fantastic  lined with hundreds of rickety cars from the era and filled with people in monochrome suits and hats . true time  travel  even if a little cgi is needed .  br    br   the story is also a winner  offering a human face to what is often seen as a stereotypical genre of movie villain . law is surprisingly menacing as the almost mechanical killer maguire and proves that you don  t have to be cagney or de niro or brando to play a gangster . the film is decidedly noir  ish  driving rain and ill  lit warehouses predominate but at least violence and killing are  finally  seen to have an emotional and psychological impact on those who perpetrate and those who merely witness such acts . the whole thing is evocative of a previous age and previous movies but it sweeps away the old and refreshes with a modern tale of redemption amid the tommy  gun shootouts and extortion rackets . it can feel a little slow in places  especially if you  re used to masses of gun  play in movies like most modern audiences  like yours truly  but sometimes  words can speak louder than actions . mendes has delivered a fine follow  up to his oscar  winning debut  a film which is as intelligent as it is beautiful to watch .  road to perdition  may not be to everyone  s tastes but this is one dvd i shall not be exchanging anytime soon .  ,1
this is an  odysessy through time  via computer animation  supposedly th work of over    artists . made in the late    s and released in      this was cutting edge stuff for the day . i thought it was good and quite interesting in spots .  br    br   most of the short scenes made no sense  just forms evolving into other forms  but that was fun to watch . this is all about visuals  not really about any kind of a story . there were some strange sequences in which odd  looking men  creatures would dance around with birds overheard . all of it is computer animated which was new back then . even the term  computer animated  was not well  known .  br    br   it  s simply a chance to show off this new technology in short bits of cartoon  like happenings with beautiful colors and imaginative scenes . no words  just pictures with electronic music . stoners must have really loved this .  br    br   it  s a nice  intriguing   minutes of  eye candy  and  head candy .  by today  s cg effects this may have lost impact  but i think you  d still be entertained by this .  ,1
i have seen the running man several times as i am a stephen king fan and have all his movies but now it is even better because up until  days ago i didn  t know about this website and i didn  t realize that the paul michael glaser that was involved with this movie was the same paul michael glaser that i grow up watching on starsky and hutch television show . for me this is a pleasant surprise because i can  t tell you how many times i cried when starsky or hutch got hurt . the episode where starsky  kill starsky  almost died i cried so hard my dad had to turn away from the show . what to you expect of a kid at age   . now  i intentionally look for films and programs involving paul or david soul and anything that stephen king has his hands on i  m so there         just got to say happy birthday paul       ,1
saw this film ran in the wee hours on tcm . several problems with the film were apparent from what i saw . first  the adults did not age when the children did for   years . several parts of the film had continuity problems  for some reason the actor who played the youngest son looked like the oldest when the   years passed .  br    br   the copy i saw was missing about   minutes or so  at least a huge gap with black screen appeared . it is too bad  because even though the script left something to be desired  bergman  russell both did fine in the film in their roles . it is a shame the large chunk is missing  but what is here is watchable .  br    br   i just wish it was all intact . the script makes little sense in that bergman  s character is sent away when the kids are small but then brought back to take care of them when they are adults  some of the time lines don  t make sense either . there is a stock market crash that resembles     but the kids grow up to fight in world war  . all the acting by the support folks in this film is fine . just wonder what was in the   gap of film i could not see as it was missing .  ,0
this is a film that has it all  the dashing hero  the beautiful damsel in distress  the noble figure with the tragic flaw  and a truly wonderful robot . forbidden planet has maintained that special magic over the years and doesn  t lose its flavor with repeated viewings  although the sex appeal of the youthful anne francis helps considerably on that score  .  br    br   movie fans will recognize the youngish leslie nielsen portraying the handsome and heroic commander adams  although those of us who have grown fond of him in comedic roles will perhaps be a bit taken aback by his appearance in a serious role . the distinguished and noble  looking walter pidgeon is also a featured player as the scientist with a secret  id  . other supporting cast deserve a nod  especially warren stevens as the brainy and resourceful  doc   and of course the charms of miss francis  as noted above .  br    br   this film was an early pioneer in the use of electronic music  in the     s  no less . the credits call them  tonalities   but those of us who tried to tinker together early versions of the  theremin  device will recognize the eerie and spooky whines and screeches sometimes used in the sound track . still  it lends to the image of the exotic and alien landscape of the mysterious and forbidding world of the krell .  br    br   the special effects are also quite arresting . i recall my fear as a youngster waiting for the next manifestation of the invisible  id  monster  and when it is finally visualized in the one battle scene it literally shook me to my toes in wonder and awe . the magic of matte art is fully exploited in the dizzying scenes of the krell scientific complex as the characters make their way through the various labyrinths and passageways  guided by the enigmatic dr . morbius .  br    br   i recall feeling some measure of jealously that dr . morbius would have such a cool toy in the form of robby the robot . the persona of robby is quite charming and in some ways he seems more human than some of the other characters . viewers of follow  on shows like twilight zone and lost in space will recognize the recycled robby prop in some of those episodes  although i recall he never had the  personality  of the original robby .  br    br   i must admit to not fully understanding the complexities of the plot until i was old enough to understand the various references to freudian psychology and the danger of unleashing the hidden and normally contained fears and rage we carry within but have trained ourselves  through force of will  to submerge and control through adherence to societal codes . although the key to the story seems obvious once revealed  it remains unknown  or perhaps deliberately overlooked  by dr . morbius until pointed out by the clear  thinking commander adams  who forces dr . morbius to confront the evil within himself . it still gives me goose bumps when commander adams pushes dr . morbius down before the krell machine that endowed him with superior intellect  which opened the flood gates of his subconscious to the power of the krell machine  here . here is where your mind was artificially enlarged . consciously it still lacked the power to operate the great machine . but your subconscious had been made strong enough .  zowee   br    br   forbidden planet remains probably my favorite sci  fi film ever  and remains timeless and classic for its carefully crafted story and wonderful visualization and realization on the screen .  ,1

sadly   simple rules  for dating my teenage daughter  was the last sitcom that john ritter got to work on after his tragic death in     . he was one of my all time favourite actors . he had it all  comedy  who can forget him in three  s company  but he was also an excellent dramatic actor  unforgivable  worth watching tv movie  as much i loved all the other cast members of the show  katey  amy  kaley and martin  john was the star  he was much of the reason i was drawn to the show in the first place  and it was his perfect comedic delivery that was able to crack me up each and every time .  br    br   i loved how the show wasn  t all sugary sweet  as much as i loved the cosby show  come on  they were too nice to each other lol  they portrayed the typical family dynamics brilliantly . it was realistic enough what with all the sibling rivalry and the squabbles between parents  but they still kept it funny . a lot of american sitcoms try and fill the shows entirely with morals and what not  and this show didn  t do that . yes  there were some  like tackling important issues  such as drugs and bullying  but they didn  t try and be anything other than a fun family comedy .  br    br   the way they wrote john  s death in to the show was brilliantly done  i still sob like a baby each time i see it . you could feel how raw the emotions were during those incredibly hard episodes .  br    br   i  m sad the show was cancelled  i still enjoy watching the reruns  and i never get tired of it .  br    br   john ritter  you  ll always be remembered for you hilarious depiction of this over protective father  who would rather lock his daughters up in their room than have them date a boy   you rock ritter     ,1
i actually paid to see this movie in the theater .  br    br   it would get a   rating  but the fight scenes between the robots are okay  and there  s a surprise .  br    br   i realize that some movies have larger budgets than others . i don  t have a problem with that . unfortunately  science fiction movies probably suffer the most on a small budget for obvious reasons . but  one way this movie fails is that just about every piece of each set looked cheesy and cheap . i mean  couldn  t they even make it  look  good   br    br   the other major reason this movie is horrible is the acting if i watched the movie now and knew what to expect  i might just enjoy it for the cheese  factor  but at the time  i was expecting a good movie and had no clue as to how horrible it would actually end up being .  br    br   thankfully  the experience was over in only   minutes .  ,0
this is an almost action  less film following jack  an insomniac  as he goes through hallucinations  is visited by dead friends  throws himself off a building  and  for a lot of the time  can  t tell reality from hallucination .  br    br   dominic monaghan  as jack  is truly believable . confused  and scared but lethargic and  at times blankly accepting of what he sees  we follow him trying to sort out what he  s seeing and find a way to sleep .  br    br   introduce a talking dog  another hallucination  and children that suddenly appear in jack  s bathroom and bedroom without any explanation as to how they got there  more hallucination  and you have an interesting  mind boggling    minutes and the shower scene is enough to get any dom fan coming back for more .  ,1
this documentary explores a story covered in pilger  s latest book  freedom next time   which was published in     . it reveals the shocking expulsion of the natives of diego garcia  one of the chagos islands in the indian ocean .  br    br   the islanders are technically british citizens  as diego garcia is a british colony  much like mauritius  the nearby island to where the natives were exiled  used to be . but the british government has ignored their pleas to return to their homeland  as the island is now a military base for the united states army  who have used it as a basis for the bombing of iraq and afghanistan .  br    br   as usual  pilger  s coverage is shocking  especially as he documents the treatment and the current impoverished living conditions of the surviving islanders . his interviews all round are excellent  and his cornering of a parliament representative where he uses the government  s own information to pin him down  ranks as one of his best .  br    br   pilger also uses dramatic reconstruction to dissect a series of recently released documents that fully illuminate the british conspiracy to evict the natives . the weaving of this footage with the interviews  and the islanders music  really heightens the film  s impact .  br    br   it is not easy viewing  but  stealing a nation  is john pilger at his best . recommended .  ,1
don  t get me wrong  the movie is beautiful  the shots are stunning  and the material is dramatic . however  it was a big disappointment and i actually left very angry at what disney had done .  br    br   bbc  s planet earth was all of the above and more . it was subtle . it had an overall feeling of balance and showed the full circle of life and death . there was tragedy and triumph  loss and gain . it was balanced .  br    br   disney  s edit of earth is none of this . they tried to make it a movie us americans would talk about . they made it dramatic . they put an over the top musical score there to frighten us . they made predators evil . they made walruses evil . they showed every encounter as negative . it tried to be suspenseful and succeeded  but at the expense of the lesson of balance . the movie was an hour and a half of negative portrayal and only about   minutes of positive .  br    br   i am all for preventing global warning  but this was over the top political and environmental junk .  br    br   that  s another thing  i went to see it on the big screen  but was disappointed in the picture quality . it looked better on my tv at home .  br    br   if you want to see something like this and get the whole picture  go out and buy  rent  or borrow the bbc  s planet earth series . it is better lessons  better sound  and  if you have blu  ray  better picture quality .  ,0
we often see movies about undesirable things going on in politics  but i still recommend  city hall  . in a role he was born to play  al pacino stars as new york  s mayor who has to deal with the shooting of a boy . but it turns out that nothing that he does will really have any effect . in this movie  the characters are as gritty as we would expect of anyone involved in a political scandal . no matter how much you trust any given politician  you may have your doubts after watching this movie .  br    br   i understand that i can  t name any specific example of something similar to what this movie portrays  but that  s not the point . if we had idealistic impressions of those at the top  this movie tears such ideas down . certainly one that i encourage you to see . also starring john cusack  bridget fonda  danny aiello  anthony franciosa and david paymer .  ,1
director warren beatty  s intention to turn chester gould  s famous comic strip into a live  action cartoon  with beatty himself cast in the lead as the square  jawed detective  had sweet overtures of innocent nostalgia   quite unusual and intriguing coming from warren beatty . unfortunately  the picture is requisite ham  fun for awhile but eventually tiring . dick tracy attempts to bring down mobster big boy caprice  aided by loving tess trueheart but tripped up by evil breathless mahoney . for the first half  hour or so  the oscar  winning art direction and set design are wonderful to absorb but  as the plot creaks along predictably  with no real sting in the writing   things begin to congeal . al pacino got a surprise supporting oscar nomination as bad boy caprice  and madonna  who is mostly used as a decorative prop  gets to sing stephen sondheim  s  sooner or later  i always get my man    which copped the award for best original song . lots of heart  thanks to beatty   who was dedicated to his vision   but the picture is too cool and calculated . it lacks heat .     from   ,0
i love this movie like no other . another time i will try to explain its virtues to the uninitiated  but for the moment let me quote a few of pieces the remarkable dialogue  which  please remember  is all tongue in cheek . aussies and poms will understand  everyone else  well   br    br    title song lyric   he can sink a beer  he can pick a queer  in his latest double  breasted bondi gear .   br    br    another song lyric   all pommies are bastards  bastards  or worse  and england is the ae  hole of the universe .   br    br    during a television interview on an  arty program    mr mackenzie what artists have impressed you most since you  ve been in england   barry  s response  flamin  bull  artists   br    br    while chatting up a naive young pom girl   mr mackenzie  i suppose you have hordes of aboriginal servants back in australia   barry  s response  abos  i  ve never seen an abo in me life . mum does most of the solid yacca  ie hard work  round our place .  br    br   this is just a taste of the hilarious farce of this bonser aussie flick . if you can get a copy of it  watch and enjoy .  ,1
i was forced to watch this whole series of films as a young child and i was told they were real  talk about child abuse . i would have been less frightened of dracula or frankenstein . this series is only good for people who believe in this ridiculousness and who want to indoctrinate their children into believing the same . besides the obvious issues associated with brainwashing and indoctrination  there  s also the bad acting  bad writing  and bad  special effects  . they are just all around terrible  terrible movies . yes  believable  and horrifying  to a kid  but i can  t imagine a grown  up buying into this shlock . although  i must say  that i would be interested in seeing them today  as an adult . they might have a certain midnight  cult movie feel to them .  ,0

this was one of those  .   cent deals of yore    and far more complex than most realize    and it was in color  not only are the effects extraordinary  vs . crap like  earth vs . the flying saucers     the real  killer  is the  universality of plot     everything hinges on two principles    the ancient concept of a hidden incestuous  thinking father  s desire for his daughter  and the idea of what would happen should a world  s tech reach the point where all citizen  s desires become manifest .  br    br   needless to say if everyone we wished dead gets dead  not many  if any left    and that became the fate of the  forbidden  planet  s populace    rather modern  actually . unfortunately the  gear  of  the krell     wasted by ignorance  remains  and  morpheus   the incestuous father  knows how to access such tech    and does so  to prevent losing his daughter to another . ancient plot  beautifully rendered .  br    br   and considering its age  it remains a stunning suspense  action  human  emotion classic    and visually very modern    don  t pass this one up    it presages all modern sci  fi    and its pscychological content elevates it  beyond any genre    a timeless work     br    br   and the soundtract  you will see  hear no pure  synth  and perfectly syched moog background    a  not miss      ,1
i just saw this movie  and i have to say that it was a big waste of time . the girl who played eva  ellen fjaestad  can  t act at all . she read her lines very un  naturally  and she had a very un  natural facial expression through the entire movie . rosanna munter who played petra on the other hand  is a natural . she played her part with great perfection .  br    br   spoilers  the story was simple  we  ve seen it many  many times before . she breaks up  he finds another  she get jealous  he breaks up with the other girl and they end up back together in the end . there were no surprises at all  one knew that eva would break up  and that adam would  hook up  with petra . the only thing that nobody saw coming was that petra told adam to go after eva at the party . she became all serious  which is a side of petra the viewers hadn  t seen earlier in the movie  and told him to win eva  s heart back  which was really cute .  br    br   besides rosanna munter  there isn  t a single actor who gives a memorable performance .  br    br   this is a mediocre movie with mediocre actors  so i don  t recommend it   ,0

dear me . where do i start  the dad isn  t anywhere near old enough to be the girl  s dad . he corpses on camera in the first  minutes of the film . the favoured exclamation in this film is  jesus christ     . zombies are agile  stupid and few and far between . motives are utterly incomprehensible and a narrative does not exist . people  rush  to their destination in jeeps driven at  mph . the world seems to be carrying on as normal yet these are supposed to be the end days . breasts appear for the sake of breasts . normally such an approach would provide some redemption but the rest of the film actually made me uninterested in breasts or the future of humanity . there  s a dog for no reason and thin  orange blood that turns the stomach . the general and his catchphrase of  shut the fk up   is the only redeeming feature . as for the rest  i sincerely hope to hear that they had done the decent thing and killed themselves .  ,0
i felt obliged to watch this movie all the way through  since i had found it in a bargain bin and bought it for my own  but i came close many times to turning it off and just writing off the money i had paid for it . if you are a fan of gore and sadism  this movie is ok . if there is one thing that the makers of this film know  it is the creative use of fake blood and body parts for a sickening effect . if that doesn  t thrill you  then stay away .  br    br   this movie is shot on a home video camera  with grade school props and terrible actors . it  s dubbed from german  but even allowing for that  the sound is awful . this film is about as budget as budget gets  except for the aforementioned special effects . if they had spent a little more money on actors and a real script instead of blood and guts  the film might have been a little more enjoyable .  br    br   the story is about three men that land on an island inhabited by an army of tin  masked sadists . they are captured  and the rest of the movie is about their attempt to escape . i call this a story in the loosest sense  since it is really a series of scenes of torture and combat strung together by inane obscenity  filled dialog .  br    br   there is nothing whatsoever redeeming about this movie  unless you like mindless gore . consider yourself warned .  ,0
this one came out during the western genre  s last gasp unfortunately  it emerges to be a very minor and altogether unsatisfactory effort  even if made by and with veterans in the field  to begin with  the plot offers nothing remotely new james coburn escapes from a chain gang  intent on killing the man  now retired  who put him there  charlton heston . while the latter lays a trap for him  coburn outwits heston by kidnapping his daughter  barbara hershey  . naturally  the former lawman  accompanied by hershey  s greenhorn fianc  chris mitchum   sets out in pursuit of coburn and his followers  all of whom broke jail along with him .  br    br   rather than handling the proceedings in his customary sub  fordian style  mclaglen goes for a sam peckinpah approach  with which he  s never fully at ease repellent characters  plenty of violence  and the sexual tension generated by hershey  s presence among coburn  s lusty bunch . incidentally  heston and coburn had previously appeared together in a sam peckinpah western  the troubled major dundee       i really need to pick up the restored edition of this one on dvd  though i recently taped the theatrical version in pan  and  scan format off tcm uk  . anyway  the film is too generic to yield the elegiac mood it clearly strives for  suggested also by the title   then again  both stars had already paid a fitting valediction to this most american of genres  will penny       for heston and coburn with pat garrett  billy the kid         br    br   at least  though  heston maintains a modicum of dignity here  his ageing character attempting to stay ahead of half  breed coburn by anticipating what his next move will be the latter  however  tackles an uncommonly brutish role and only really comes into his own at the climax  relishing his moment of vengeance by sadistically forcing heston to witness his associates  gang  rape of hershey  . apart from the latter  this lengthy sequence sees heston try to fool coburn with a trick borrowed from his own el cid        the villainous gang is then trapped inside a bushfire ignited by the practiced heston and the violent death of the two obsolete  protagonists  as was his fashion  heston  s demise takes the form of a gratuitous sacrifice   .  br    br   the supporting cast includes michael parks as the ineffectual town sheriff  jorge rivero as coburn  s mexican lieutenant  and larry wilcox  of the tv series chips   as the youngest member of coburn  s gang who  s assigned the task of watching over hershey  while doing his best to keep his drooling mates away   . jerry goldsmith contributes a flavorful but  at the same time  unremarkable score .  ,0

nothing is fantastic  simple as that  it  s a film that shouldn  t work  yet does . natali stays in the realm of sci  fi  however this film is also a comedy . cypher it seemed was a big budget draining affair for natali  at   .  million  woo  hoo pa   so with nothing he scales down again . this is low budget  independent film  making at it  s best . simple  good old fashioned storytelling and an attempt at making a film for artistic merit as apposed to hollywood  s usual reasons for mostly financial gain . nothing is a film about nothing and before you ask  no it is not anything like seinfeld  basically andrew and dave are a couple of losers . they live in a strange looking house beneath two freeways . andrew is a telesales travel agent who is agoraphobic while dave is andrews best mate who stays with him rent free to help him out . dave is tired of it however and has a gorgeous girlfriend who he wants to move in with . by bizarre mis  fortunes however  dave finds out his girlfriend embezzled a huge amount of money from daves work  place incriminating dave  and andrew is wrongly accused of sexually assaulting a girl scout  canadian humour people   . as it turns out andrew  s house is to be demolished as well and he can  t stop it happening as the house was built on land it should not have been built on . both andrew and dave are inside the house when the police and the demolition team come calling . they are desperate and can  t escape  and in the panic and confusion just as the police burst in everything fades to white . what has happened  have dave and andrew died  they wake to find themselves still in the house only it is quiet . no police  no demolition team  no angry girl scout mother  what happens is dave and andy discover they have the ability to  wish or hate away .  as it turns out they have hated away the entire outside world . they are left alone . the house is surrounded by nothing  which is portrayed as pure white . so what this means is that the films setting is a house set and then just white . the film is an interesting view on human isolation and the psyche and of course as they spend more time alone together with no food and no water  they begin to tire of each other . they discover they can hate away hunger  which is useful but obviously things get out of hand shall we say . i can  t reveal much but i must say bouncing heads are quite a sight to behold .  br    br   this film is quirky  funny  interesting . the effects are simple yet effective and natali brings together two buddies from cube  david hewlett  and andrew millar to lead the film . they have chemistry and also work very well . they have to hold    of the movie by themselves and much of it in a pure white background  yet it works . certainly i expect this to get the same diabolical treatment as cypher did and it should appear on dvd in a year or two in the states . nothing is a top quality and unique film and although not as good as cube or cypher it once again proves natali as one of the best up and comers .  br    br   natali is someone who has really interested me in his three features so far and i cannot wait for his next feature . i prey to god he doesn  t do the proposed necropolis  written and directed by add sufferer  the ever crap paul anderson . vincenzo old buddy if paul comes round to your pad  run    run like the wind   i hope and prey this guy doesn  t take to hollywood like alex proyas did  with the enjoyable yet pussy  footed  sugar coated  helium light i robot   . keep your eyes peeled for this guy .   ,1
utterly predictable silly show about a man who has killed his wife by mowing her down when driving and claimed he had blacked out . why was he still driving a car  why did he still feel able to drive a car having killed his wife with one  this question has not occurred to the writers . the story then witters on about a psychologist and her failing marriage which is tied into the failing marriage of wife  killing blackout driver . an omniscient mother and one dimensional child are thrown in for good measure  and the whole builds up to a predictable denouement and crashing finale . are police psychologists so easily taken in  deadful writing that the actors do their best with  but they are doomed to failure . this is on a par with a harlequin romance . don  t waste your time watching this one unless that  s what you are aiming for .  ,0

will and ted  s bodacious journey is an existential trip through themes of mortality  religion  time  heaven and hell  man  s quest for fame and his fears of the body being overcome by a soulless machine . it is the most intelligent work of fiction since paradise lost and references many great past works of art  dante  iron maiden  virgil  shakespeare . this time the dudes are a famous rock band having travelled through time collecting icons from the past  napolean  joan of ark  noah  s wife   oscar wilde  and charles darwin . they took the skills they learned from each of these people  abducted a couple of princesses  and finally learned to play their guitars and write hit songs . these songs teach the world to love again and war  hunger  evil are vanquished for eternity . we fast forward into the distant future where an evil dictator who despises good music called simon cow  al wants to rule the world . he eats rooshus  the cool guy from the first film who helps bill playboy esquire and ted theodore alvin  and gains the power to send two cyborgs back in time . the cyborgs are living tissue over metal exoskeleton and coated in mimetic poly alloy allowing them the survive the turmoil of time travel  and they can imitate anything they sample by physical contact . it is their job to kill the good biff and fred and take over their lives by making terrible music that no  one could like . by doing this they will change the world forever  gryll and jed  s music will never be made leaving a world of war  famine  and hatred  and more annoyingly  bland boy  girl group pop music . there is a startling twist as the good guys actually are killed and they have to work out a way to save the world  themselves  and their wives from the evil dopplebangers inhabiting their bodies .  br    br   penelope spheerhead shows her knowledge of both youth culture and real culture by mixing modern day music and phrases with post modern sets and artistic references  and seeks to teach us all something by delving into our very psyche to show us ourselves . she presents the nightmares which faced the late   s teen in a society which had abandoned them and beckons us to dissect the post structuralist jingoism  self love  and malaise of the time . charging us with a belief that we can indeed change the world it is an inspiring message  but in order to achieve such dreams we must traverse and indeed face our nightmares . to overcome is to succeed  to defeat death is the first step in truly living and not merely surviving . in the words of kenneth reeves   wow   best scene for a fun game  see how many songs  bands  and albums cover references you can spot throughout the film . there are at least  .  ,1
this movie makes no sense at all  there are plot holes big enough to drive enormous nypd vehicles through . the characters do not act in any plausible way whatsoever . i will put my comments in the chat board  but save your time and money  this is stupid . i can  t stand when hollywood spends millions of dollars on flash bang equipment and uses fancy editing and cool music  and does not bother to have a plot that hangs together at even the most basic level . but it is nice to see denzel w . prevail over the man  who comes in  flavors  jodi foster  mayor bloomberg and capt . von trapp . there is even a sweet little kid with a video game who is nice .  ,0
the previous poster obviously worked on the movie . it  s a joke how bad it is and no one would review this kind of movie the way he did . mentioning all of the actors  names and what they were in previously is a sure sign that he  s involved with it in some way .  br    br   it  s on cinemax right now and i was sure this was some movie where porn stars  the one called ava is gorgeous and well  endowed  were forced to make something else for some crazy tax reason .  br    br   also  when i first saw it  i was sure it was made in about      and i was born in     so i thought i knew what i was talking about . . . but no . . . it was made in       unbelievable   br    br   though i would call it one of those so bad it  s good movies . like watching a train wreck .  ,0
i have been a huge lynn peterson fan ever since her breakthrough role in the     blockbuster movie  far north   and even though i loved her in her one other film  slow        where she plays  francis   this is by far and away her strongest role .  br    br   lynn  as i  m sure you all know  or should   plays the critical role of  driver  .  br    br   unfortunately  other than lynn  s amazing performance  i  m afraid this movie doesn  t really have much going for it .  br    br   oh wait  there was one other thing  the amazing creativity of the editing to remove profanity for tv viewers . memorable lines like  you son  of  a  gun     you son  of  a  witch     shoot    and  well  forget you    br    br   o . k . bye .  br    br   p . s .  does anyone know where i can get another lynn peterson poster   ,0
here  s a real weirdo for you . it starts out with another take  off on the psycho shower scene  on campus  then gets crazier when several coeds and their doofy boyfriends head south for spring break . the trouble starts when they drive into the redneck county ruled by homicidal sheriff dean . one of the college cuties wanders into the woods  witnesses a murder by the sheriff and has her head blown open . then it  s lets  rip  off macon county line  time as dean stalks  traps and slaughters the witless witnesses one by one . tony march is on  target as the evil  shotgun  happy dean . the movie  s overall tone is truly disturbing . the ending is so abrupt you almost think the director ran out of film it  s also a study in despair . shallow grave is a must for misanthropes  misogynists and nihilists the world over .  ,1
this is a true     s movie   back then they made maybe    times more movies than nowadays  and that makes many of them quite interesting . . . it was a cultural phenomenon  that don  t exist anymore . nowadays maybe the same kind of people that would have made cheap  straight  to  video   movies in the eighties  are doing cheap porn . porn seems to sell . anyway  this is above the medium trash  movie level it has goodfascinating story  and it  s quite well made i think . in one scene you can even see the microphone swinging on the upper edge of the picture . of course there are also little cameos by ozzy and gene simmons  but they don  t very much contribute to the film  success   although they are good in their small roles . the monster  heavy  singer  sammi curr   looks really terrible  especially when he  s singing . one of the scariest monsters i  ve seen in horror flicks . i may have nightmares of him next night . not recommended for intellectual movie lovers .  ,1
what a time we live in when someone like this joe swan  whatever the hell is considered a good filmmaker . . . or even a filmmaker at all  where are the new crop of filmmakers with brains and talent    we need them bad  and to hell with mumblecore   br    br   this movie is about nothing  just as the characters in the film stand for nothing . it  s this horrible  so  called gen y  that is full of bored idiots  some of which declare themselves filmmakers with out bothering to learn anything about the craft before shooting . well  orson welles was a filmmaker . john huston was a filmmaker . fellini was a filmmaker . dreyer was a filmmaker  etc . current films like these show just how stupid young  so  called  filmmakers  can be when they believe going out with no script  no direction  no thought  no legit  camerawork   everything shot horribly on dv   no craft of editing  no nothing  stands for  rebellious  or  advanced  film  making . nope  it  s called ignorance and laziness or just pure masturbation of cinema  and there actually is an in  your  face  jack  off shot   so be ready  .  br    br   look at the early films of any accomplished  indie  filmmaker linklatter  morris  allen  lynch  hartley  jarmusch  jost  lee  or herzog . . . none made anything as tedious and aimless as this  yet swan  whatever the hell  is still going to sxsw every year and hailed as some kind of gutsy  new talent . it  s crap  i can  t imagine anyone liking this  and everything else this so  called filmmaker has done  all seen by me  is just as bad  the newer stuff clearly made to appeal to a more mainstream audience  one of the sitcom calling  . steer clear  unless you  re a friend or family member of those involved . . . on second thought  if you  re a family member or friend you  d probably be embarrassed to see a family member or friend in such compromising situations . . .  br    br   utter garbage . this isn  t art . this is the ultimate opposite of it .  ,0
this movie is not your typical horror movie . it has some campy humor and death scenes which can be sort of comical . i personally liked the movie because of its off  beat humor . it  s definetely not a super scary movie  which is good if you don  t want to be scared and paranoid afterwards . i liked the performance of the hillbilly guy and of lester . . . very believable . i think i  m going to dye my hair red like that girl in scarecrow  very cool  anyway  overall worth renting for the campy humor and non typical horror experience .  ,1
tom hanks like you  ve never seen him before . hanks plays michael sullivan   the angel of death  . he is a hitman for his surrogate father john rooney  paul newman  an elderly irish mob boss . sullivan  s young son  tyler hoechlin  witnesses what his father does for a living and both are soon on the road for seven weeks robbing banks to avenge the murder of sullivan  s wife and other son . enter jude law as a reporter  photographer willing to kill sullivan himself for the chance to add to his collection of photos of dead mobsters . filmed beautifully catching the drama of life in the    s . sometimes the pace bogs down  but then a burst of graphic violence sustains the story . director sam mendes directs this powerful drama about loyalty  responsibility  betrayal and the bonding of a secretive man and his young son . other notable cast members are dylan baker  stanley tucci  daniel craig and jennifer jason leigh . hanks again proves to be excellent in a very memorable movie . make room for some oscars   ,1
the omega code was a model of cinematographical inconsistency . there was a bit  but precious little  of good acting  primarily by the two prophets and rostenberg  who only appeared once and had no lines . otherwise the acting was decidedly bad . the plot line was rather weak  and only partially based on already questionable biblical interpretation . certainly not one of the year  s best .  ,0
mukhsin is a beautiful movie about a first love story . everyone probably has one  and this is writer  director yasmin ahmad  s story of hers  with a boy called mukhsin . we know that her movies have been semi  autobiographical of sorts  having scenes drawn upon her personal experiences  and it is indeed this sharing and translating of these emotions to the big screen  that has her films always exude a warm sincerity and honesty . mukhsin is no different  and probably the most polished ad confident work to date  though i must add  as a personal bias  that sepet still has a special place in my heart  .  br    br   our favourite family is back  pak atan  mak inom  orked and kak yam  though this time  we go back to when orked is age   . the characters are all younger from the movies we  ve journeyed with them  from rabun to gubra  and here  sharifah amani  s sisters sharifah aryana and sharifah aleya take on the roles of orked and mak inom respectively  which perhaps accounted for their excellent chemistry together on screen  nevermind that their not playing sibling roles . the only constant it seems is kak yam  played by adibah noor  and even pak atan has hair on his head  through mukshin the movie  we come full circle with the characters  and the world that yasmin has introduced us to . we come to learn of and understand the family a little bit more  set in the days when they  re still living in their kampung  revisited back in rabun   where orked attends a chinese school  and packs some serious combination of punches  and you wonder about that burst of energy in gubra  well  she had it in her since young   . the perennial tomboy and doted child of the family  she prefers playing with the boys in games  rather than mindless  masak  masak  with the girls  and favourite outings include going with the family to football matches .  br    br   the arrival of a boy called mukhsin  mohd syafie naswip  to the village provides a cool peer for orked to hang out and do stuff with  cycling through the villages  climbing trees  flying kites . and as what is desired to be explored  the crossing of that line between friendship and romance  both beautiful emotions .  br    br   mukhsin does have its cheeky moments which liven up the story  and bring about laughter  because some of the incidents  we would have experienced it ourselves  and sometimes serve as a throwback to our own recollection of childhood . in short  those scenes screamed  fun   we observe the life in a typical kampung  where some neighbours are very nice  while others  the nosy parkers and rumour mongers  spreading ill gossip stemming from envy . there are  additional family dynamics seen  one from an immediate neighbour  and the other from mukhsin  s own  both of which serve as adequate subplots  and contrast to orked  s own .  br    br   as always  yasmin  s movies are filled with excellent music  and for mukhsin  it has something special  the song  hujan  as penned by her father  as well as  ne me quitte pas   aptly used in the movie given that the yasmin  s movies to date have been centred around the same characters  the beauty of it is that you can watch them as stand alone  or when watched and pieced together  makes a compelling family drama dealing with separate themes and universal issues like interracial romance  love  and forgiveness . fans will definitely see the many links in mukhsin back to the earlier movies  while new audiences will surely be curious to find out certain whys and significance of recurring characters or events  like that pudgy boy who steals glances at orked .  br    br   and speaking of whys  parts of mukhsin too is curiously open  which probably is distinctive of yasmin  s style  or deliberately left as such . i thought that as a story about childhood  recollected from memory  then there are details which will be left out for sure . and subtly  i felt that mukhsin exhibited this perfectly  with not so detailed details  and the focus on what can be remembered in significant episodes between the two .  br    br   another highly recommended movie  and a rare one that i feel is suitable for all ages  bring along your kid brother or sister   ,1
yes  a true classic  this is what british drama is all about  realism and the minimal use of special effects  and over inflated budgets  . i last saw this drama when it was last screened on british terrestial tv in     . it truly should be viewed by everyone who likes a scary plot  no big names but non  the  less great acting . sadly the copywrite is now owned by someone unknown and as such this great drama is unlikely to be aired anytime soon . i myself recently acquired the woman in black on vhs  so now once again i shall be able to enjoy this truly great british drama . you should try and enjoy it too   br    br   mark r . horobin  ,1
this film has its share of negative comments and i have to agree with those who consider it one of the worst movies ever made . true  most of the films based on the works of king are pretty bad  but this one goes beyond bad into the realm of horrible . there is not one scary moment in it unless you consider stupidity scary . it is typical king garbage   myths twisted around that made no sense in the first place  mixed with obvious and belabored so  called  scares  that are about as shocking as peewee  s playhouse  which  at least  is entertaining  . it is full of ridiculous moments  not the least of which is alice krige  s character . when she goes on a rampage and starts quipping like the villain in an old batman tv show  it is so absurd as to be sickening . all the people who had cameos in this  including john landis  are lucky they still have careers . but the most absurd part has to be the cat costumes towards the end  which look like cheap rubber outfits someone bought at k  mart . the best part of the movie is the appearance of some real cats who actually out  act the people in the movie .  ,0

i know nothing of the iliad so can not comment on it  s accuracy to that story . however  as a stand alone film i found this very boring . the battle scenes tried to be large and spectacular but they were just obvious cgi .  br    br   the acting is poor and no doubt brad pitt was cast just to attract the ladies . but he does not make a good warrior  too pretty i am afraid .  br    br   good points are is the design . this film does look good with the landscape and castle buildings  walls impressive . i do like a film that at least tries to get the characters accents true but this film just seems to ignore it completely . we hear american  scottish english anything but what you might expect for a film about an ancient eastern civilisation .  br    br   all in all  i do not recommend this film for a family sit down . it is too long and the young will get bored .  br    br   for adults  it is ok if you don  t care about the lack realism .  ,0
this is one of those movies that appears on cable at like two in the afternoon to entertain bored housewives while they iron . the acting is second rate . poor mathew modine seems to sleepwalk through the whole film . and god help gina gershon . her accent is too over the top . it sounds nothing like an true english woman . it sounds forced and phony  much like her acting . she should stick to what she does best  lesbian showgirl con  artist who plays in a rock  roll band and has a drug problem . the other characters are no better . they are two dimensional . empty  vapid and silly . how are we to supposed to care about these people . at one point christy scott cashman get  s lost in central park . really  it  s not that hard to navigate central park . just follow any path out . not only did i not care about any of the characters  i downright hated them . the only reason i even stayed with this train  wreck of a film was fisher stevens . even his brilliant humor couldn  t save this dying fish . each scene is typical romantic comedy fare and nothing is left to surprise us . the script was awful as was the acting . if you catch this fish throw it back   ,0

this is the first must see film i  ve seen in the last year  it  s wickedly funny  incredibly original  unbelievably great looking  they went for this super cool wide  screen technicolor look that  s awesome to behold   and it actually has depth in character and in what it says about society . it  s really smart satire that nails everything from homeland security to race issues  while at the same time leaving you laughing and realizing how much are world lives in fear . carrie anne moss turns in a comedic performance i never imagined would come from her  she  s sweet  funny and sexy  billy connolly is great as fido who can only grunt and moan  and dylan baker as the dad is priceless . in fact the whole cast is perfect . henry czerny as the bad guy  tim blake nelson as the neighbor with the hot sexy zombie girlfriend  getting the idea now   funny  though  provoking and just all round amazing  go and see this movie  it  s like nothing you  ve ever seen before .  ,1
one wonders how the script came to be written .  br    br   wayne and the other performers do an ok job but as it is neither comedy  romantic thriller or anything else it is all rather disappointing .  br    br   one feels as if one of the threads had been pursued it could have been something worthwhile . it is nonetheless interesting to see a real turkey of a story made just before the usa became directly involved with the war . i wonder if the surrounding politics had something to do with trying to make a movie for all tastes but ending up with something that pleases no one .  br    br   nonetheless it has historical value .  ,0
what a piece of junk this movie was . the premise was okay  but even in the beginning with crappy effects to blend in a giant with normal sized people  even the effects in hercules was better  i knew this would be bad . but the really awful part of the movie is the dialogs . it  s completely incoherent  silly and stupid . i felt like it had been written by some  th grader in creative class and gotten a d  . i want to slap casper van diem and the other actors for following this movie through .  br    br   i  ve had my share of cheesy and bad movies  i love the tremors series   but this . . . i do not recommend it at all . it  s silly and the totally flabbergastingly bad dialogs will make you cringe .  ,0
i found myself at sixes and sevens while watching this one . altman  s touch with zooms in and out were there  and i expected those devices to comment on characters and situations . unfortunately  as far as i could see  they sometimes were gratuitous  sometimes witty  often barren for failing to point out some ironic or other connection . in particular  two zoom  outs from the gilt dome in savannah merely perplexed . to be fair  though  a few zooms  outs and ins  to branagh heightened his character  s increasing bewilderment  a la pudgy mccabe  s or philip marlow  s . on the whole  the zooms were  well  inconsistent  and sometimes even trite .  br    br   other almanesque devices  such as multiple panes of glass between camera and subject  succeeded in suggesting characters  sollipsism or narcissism or opaque states of knowledge . car windshields  house windows  and other screens were used effectively and fairly consistently  i felt  harking back to the player and even the long goodbye . a few catchy jump  cuts  especially to a suggestive tv commercial  reminded me of such usage in short cuts  to sardonic effect .  br    br   but finally  the mismatch between altman  s very personal style and the sheer weight of the grisham  genre momentum  failed to excite me . this director  s     s masterpieces revised and deconstructed various classic genres  including the chandler detective film which this resembled in some ways this time around  the director seemed to have too few arrows in his analytic quiver to strike any meaningful blow to the soft underbelly of this beastly genre . was he muzzled in by mammonist producers  perhaps  or am i missing something  due to my feeble knowledge of the genre he takes on here   br    br   nonetheless  the casting was excellent all around tom berenger  for his terrifying ferality   branagh for his  deflated  hubris  robert downey jr  s pheromonal haze  robert duvall  s method of trash  and davidtz  s lurking femme  fatality were near perfect choices all . and except for a few slips out of georgia into chicago on the part of  brunette   daryl hannah  accents were convincingly southern .  br    br   suspense and mood were engrossing  even if the story didn  t quite rivet viewers . the moodiness of a coastal pre  hurricane barometric plunge was exquisitely  painstakingly rendered   i felt like yelling at the usher to turn on the swamp cooler pronto .  br    br   torn  in the end i judged it a  .  br    br    ,1
hold your man finds jean harlow  working class girl from brooklyn falling for con man clark gable and getting in all kinds of trouble . the film starts out as his film  but by the time it  s over the emphasis definitely switches to her character .  br    br   the film opens with gable pulling a street con game with partner  garry owen and the mark yelling for the cops . as he  s being chased gable ducks into harlow  s apartment and being he  s such a charming fellow  she shields him .  br    br   before long she  s involved with him and unfortunately with his rackets . gable  harlow  and owen try pulling a badger game on a drunken paul hurst  but then gable won  t go through with it . of course when hurst realizes it was a con  he  s still sore and gets belligerent and gable has to punch him out . but then he winds up dead outside harlow  s apartment and that platinum blond hair makes her easy to identify . she goes up on an accomplice to manslaughter .  br    br   the rest of the film is her  s and her adjustment to prison life . her interaction with the other female prisoners give her some very good scenes . i think some of the material was later used for the mgm classic caged .  br    br   harlow also gets to do the title song and it  s done as torch style ballad  very popular back in those days . she talk  sings it in the manner of sophie tucker and quite well .  br    br   gable is well cast as the con man who develops a conscience  a part he  d play often  most notably in my favorite gable film  honky tonk .  br    br   still it  s harlow who gets to shine in this film . i think it  s one of the best she did at mgm  her fans should not miss it .  ,1
this was a good movie . it wasn  t your typical war flick but something a bit different . this movie showed us recruits in training before the war and not actually fighting a war . this film is one of the more realist views on war and the army than most other films like this made . colin farrel did a great job at portraying an army recruit and clifton collins jr and also matthew davis contributed reasonably well . seeing colin farrel move from b grade to a grade in a few short years  you would never thought it would happen . i will also add that the makers of tigerland did a great job at filming a movie in the year     and making it look like     was a good touch . its good to see talent used wisely and i hope to see this same talent again in the near future .  ,1

the odd couple    outta  stars   br    br   like most people i will always feel that jack klugman and tony randall are the definitive  odd couple  . their incredible work on the tv series from the early to mid    s was a highwater mark for television at the time . . . easily surpassing the stage and screen versions of the tale . nonetheless  how can you go wrong with a jack lemmon  walter matthau pairing  matthau is in especially good form as oscar  the slob . lemmon takes a bit of getting used to as felix  particularly if you have previously seen tony randall  s outstanding performance . the script is good . . . definitely neil simon  s best .  i will go on record here as stating that neil simon is probably one of the worst  most over  rated playwrights of american theatre .  the storyline is simple felix  a neat freak and newly separated from his wife moves in with oscar  the slob who needs some help saving money for alimony payments . their living arrangement becomes much like a marriage as well  culminating in some amusing tiffs and spats . lots of fun and some great one  liners .  ,1
star rating  saturday night  friday night  friday morning  sunday night  monday morning  br    br   long time inmate twitch  kurupt  gets himself transfered to a tougher prison than the re  opened alcatraz . he claims it  s to be closer to his lady but his real motives are a bit more grandiose . there he crosses paths with burke  bill goldberg  a bulky prisoner who can take care of himself . twitch  despite being less muscular  is just as mouthy and is pretty much the same . but there is a gang war brewing between the black and hispanic inmates that explodes into a hostile takeover of the prison when the black  s gang leader is shot dead and the finger points at burke . but the sh  t really hits the fan when the real killer and leader of the hispanics  cortez  robert madrid  takes twitch  s girlfriend and burke  s daughter hostage .  br    br   steven seagal doesn  t do sequels  reportedly very opposed to the idea of under siege  and only agreeing to do it on the condition the film company he was with at the time let direct his own movie  so despite this being a dvd sequel  the lead role this time round goes to bill golberg  steve doesn  t even appear in some of the stock footage from the first film that appears towards the end .  but there  s a reason he hasn  t done much work since universal soldier  and that  s because he  s not much of an actor  and not much of an action star either  managing a character that begins as very dark and brooding but unsubtly turns into a standard action hero awkwardly quipping off dull one  liners . support wise  veterans from the first film  kurupt and tony plana  have merely jumped at the chance of extra work .  br    br   this is a film that  s tried to copy the style of the original quite well  with the dim lighting  dark shadows and rap music playing over a lot of it . it does this quite well  unfortunately it can  t contend with an unengaging hero  an equally cardboard villain and an apathetic story that the makers do very much seem to have made up as they went along .   ,0
this film may have a questionable pedigree because it was made for tv  but it is one of the best movies i  ve seen . the film and its actors won several awards . it is gripping  fascinating  and it will absorb you completely . the story of a chase for a killer in iron  curtain russia by people who are willing to risk their careers to try to save lives of future victims would be a compelling story if it were fiction   but it  s ostensibly a true story . i highly recommend it .  ,1
even though it has one of the standard  revenge price plots   this film is my favorite of vincent price  s work . gallico has that quality that is missing in so many horror film characters  likeability . when you watch it  you feel for him  you feel his frustration  the injustices against him  and you cheer him on when he goes for vengeance  even though he frightens you a little with his original fury . as the film goes on  his character becomes tragic . he  s committed his murder  but now he must kill to cover that up . and again to cover that one up . and again . . . your stomach sinks with his soul as it goes down its spiral  like watching a beloved brother turn into a hood . even if the revenge story is of old  the plot devices themselves are original  gallico uses his tricks to kill in more and more inventive ways . a shame this one isn  t available for home veiwing .  ,1
i love this movie . it is one of those movies that you can watch time and time again and still find engaging . congratulations   i believe everyone involved in making the movie and the script should be proud of themselves . it is so eerie  you feel like you are watching a real life band . i would like to see more movies like this . i am glad that they did not choose famous hollywood stars to be in this movie because it probably would not have worked . and even if billy connolly is quite well known  he really got stuck into the role and i could not imagine anybody else playing it . congratulations again  i really believe this movie deserves the peter sellers comedy award for bill nighy . and when you get to the final scene . . . . . well what can i say      ,1
i love this movie and never get tired of watching . the music in it is great . any true hard rock fan should see this movie and buy the soundtrack . with rockers like gene simmons and ozzy osbourne you can  t go wrong .  ,1
  the domino principle  is  without question  one of the worst thrillers ever made . hardly any sense can be made of the convoluted plot and by the halfway point you  ll want to throw your arms up in frustration and scream  i give up      br    br   how gene hackman and director stanley kramer ever got involved in this mess must only be summed up by their paychecks .  br    br   i hope they spent their money well .  ,0
so i don  t ruin it for you  i  ll be very brief . there  s some great acting and funny lines from the attractive cast . a young graduate of harvard med school  brian white  finds out he doesn  t know as much as he thinks about people . he goes to a small hospital in florida for his internship because a girlfriend  mya  left him for a job as a tv producer . his senior resident  wood harris   helped marvelously by his  creative collaborator   zoe saldana  bring him up to speed . they help protect his career and show him the wider possibilities that come from being a compassionate doctor instead of a player who just wants to make money  as seems to be true for many of my pre  med friends  .  ,1
seldom do i give up on a movie without seeing the entire show . this is particularly true when i have rented it on dvd . syriana was one in which i did give up . half way through i turned it off in bored disgust .  br    br   this movie is disjointed  boring  confusing and lackluster . the acting was dry and without credible portrayals . the general plot was good but developed in such an insipid and boring fashion that it failed to grasp my attention or interest . the multiple sub plots often failed to connect to each other and seemed more like random stories than an actual connected plot . too bad such a serious subject and such great actors could create such a flop . i cannot imagine this movie receiving any nominations much less an award .  ,0
there  s a legion of mick garris haters out there who feel he couldn  t direct a horror film of quality if he had to . and  sleepwalkers  . . screenplay written by stephen king  is often used as an example of this . i like sleepwalkers  though i fully am aware that garris just says fck it and lets all hell break loose about fifteen or so minutes into the movie . forget character or plot development  who needs them anyway . it  s about violent mayhem and bloody carnage as a mother and son pair of  sleepwalkers   . . feline  human shapeshifting creatures who suck the lifeforce from virginal female innocents  moving from town to town  living a nomadic existence  truly powerful  set their sights on a teenager who doesn  t surrender without a fight . before all is said and done  many will be slaughtered as a mother shan  t tolerate the possible death of her beloved son .  br    br   garris wastes little time setting up those to be executed  as a teacher  glenn shadix   suspecting handsome  all american charmer charles brady  brian krause  to be someone entirely different from who he claims  gets his hand ripped off and his neck torn into . charles lures pretty virgins into his arms  drawing their energy  in turn  feeding  his hungry mama  mary  alice krige  . the fresh new target is tanya robertson  mdchen amick   and she seems to be easy pickens  but this will not be the case and when charles is seriously injured in a struggle  . . thanks to a deputy  s cat  clovis   mary  s vengeance will be reaped on all those who get her way . mary  come hell or high water  will retrieve tanya in the goal of  refreshing  her dying son .  br    br   like many teenagers  i had a crush on certain actresses i watched in movies . such as amy dolenz  i was smitten with mdchen amick . she  s simply adorable in this movie and i love how she bites her lower lip displaying an obvious attraction towards charles  unaware of his ulterior motives . i just knew that mdchen amick would be destined to be a scream queen  but this would never be the case . too bad because i would  ve welcomed her in the genre with open arms .  br    br   krige is yummy as the menacing  damn sexy  but vicious and mean bitch who wipes out an entire police force and poor tanya  s parents in one fail swoop  in less than ten or so minutes . she stabs one in the back with a corn cob  she bites the fingers off of poor ron perlman  before cracking his arm  . . a bone protruding   knocking him unconscious with his own elbow  she tosses tanya  s mom through a window after breaking a rose vase over her father  s face  a deputy is stabbed in his ear by charles  cop  kebab    falling on the pencil for extra impact . poor tanya is dragged by her hair from her home by mary  driven to the brady home  and forced into an impromptu dance with the crippled monster  the sheriff is hurled onto a picket fence and we see how cats combat the sleepwalkers unlike humans . we see mary and charles  abilities to  dim  themselves and his car using a power of invisibility . writer stephen king even finds time to include himself and horror director buddies of his in a crime scene sequence with clive barker and tobe hooper as forensics officers  joe dante and john landis as photograph experts .  br    br   the film is shot in a tongue  in  cheek  let  it  all  hang  out manner with music appropriately hammering this technique home . it  s about the ultra  violence  simple as that  with some deranged behavior and jet black humor complimenting garris  direction and king  s screenplay . the incestuous angle of the sleepwalkers is a bit jarring and in  your  face . without a lick of complexity  this is closer in vein to king  s own demented maximimum overdrive than his more serious works .  ,1
best show since seinfeld . she  s really really funny . her total self centeredness  the hulking gay stoner neighbors  the departures into song or cartoons  make this the freshest show on tv . one of the few shows i make point of watching . the scene with the wise old black lady in the drugstore   oh wait now that you  re close you do look old  turns face with finger and walks away lol   the cough syrup overdose  sleeping with god  it  s all so funny or so stupid it  s just a lot of fun . the shows weak points are her sister and the cop  only because they  re too darn normal   i really can  t wait until the next show  something i haven  t felt for any show in a long time .  ,1
  life stinks  is a parody of life and death  happiness and depression . the black and the white always present in our lives . mel brooks performance is brilliant as always  and the other actors work is fine too . this movie has some capra flavor  thats why is so good .  br    br   there are some unforgettable gags such as the one when brooks tries to earn some money dancing in the street  and all the people passing by just ignore him  or when he meets a funny crazy man who believes is paul getty and then start arguing and slapping each other .  br    br   if you havent seen it  you dont know what youve missed .  br    br   this movie tells us about the old and eternal struggle of the poor against the rich .  br    br   the only difference between this movie and reality is that this movie has a happy ending  and reality hasnt .  br    br   yes indeed  life stinks .  ,1
over the years  we  ve seen a lot of preposterous things done by writers when the show just had to go on no matter what  keeping   simple rules  going after john ritter died comes to mind  but this is probably the first time i cared . the idea of having  that    s show  without eric or to a lesser extent kelso is ridiculous . they tried to cover it up with a comeback of leo and increasingly outrageous story lines  but it always felt like why bother when you don  t have a main character anymore . it just didn  t really connect  it was a bunch of unrelated stuff happening that most of the time wasn  t even funny . the last season felt like the season too much for every single character  simply because eric used to take a lot of screen time and now we  d be smashed in the face by how stale and repetitive the rest of the characters were . focusing on the gimmick that is fez was thoroughly uninteresting and the character would simply stop working  because the whole deal was that he  d say something weird from out of nowhere  and you can  t say stuff from out of nowhere when every second line is yours . they also brought in the standard cousin oliver  only this time it just wasn  t a kid . whenever you heard somebody knock on the door  you started praying it wasn  t randy  please let it not be randy . the deal with randy was that he  d do really awful jokes  usually as red would say  smiling like an ass and totally screwing up delivery and donna would be in stitches . i think more than half of the last season was donna pretending to be amused . the problems had started earlier though what once was a truly great show with an equally great concept that for once wasn  t about a dysfunctional family slowly got into the territory of soap opera . everybody started being in love with everybody  emotional scenes were dragged out at nausea  with just one usually lame joke placed somewhere to divert attention that we were watching  as the world turns  . i  m guessing this was character development  but come on that was written almost as clumsily as the moral lessons from  family matters  . to be fair  the last episode  also because it had a cameo by topher grace  a cameo in his own show   was really good  even if not that funny either .  br    br   by the way  yet more criticism on season   what the hell was with the opening theme  not only did they use the same joke twice  a character not singing   fez scared the hell out of me . dude  don  t open your eyes that far . but the first five seasons or so  among the best comedy ever broadcast .  ,1
marilyn miller made only three films before her untimely death  the marvelous sally        the comedy her majesty love       and this trifle  sunny       . it is quite poor both as an early talkie and as an attempt at a musical  although she has four dance numbers  she only sings two songs  who  and one man alone  . the rest of the score including the spritely title tune are jettisoned  although we can hear the latter in the background scoring . miller looks overweight and amateurish here  no star quality at all . even her dancing is cloutish . the film is very badly written  stock full of stale and unfunny jokes and stupid situations . if you  re interested in miller as a performer  by all means  check it out  but for general entertainment  stay away .  ,0
this is simply the epitome of what a made for tv movie should be . it was a lazy sunday afternoon when my wife and i were in grad school that we stumbled upon this . the cheesy acting . the poorly written script . the good ol  boys . the ridiculous  yet somehow obvious  clich  and banal premise . the riding in pickup trucks with your propped  up wife  corpse . it has it all .  br    br   you will meet familiar characters gold  digging hussy  stupid rich boy who wants to make it on his own  friends  who  know  better  daddy who knows better but drives son away . and the wife  corpse . propped up . in a pick  up .  br    br   wow and the title . several things in our lives have been  texas tragedies  since watching this beauty . everyone involved in its creation deserves a medal .  ,1
i rented it because the second segment traumatized me as a little kid . i snuck downstairs really early one morning  started watching hbo  and the raft  segment   terrorized me good . this time around  i still enjoyed the raft  although i couldn  t tell whether it was for nostalgic reasons or if it was actually a good short . the other two segments were complete trash . i can  t believe a producer somewhere payed to make this junk . all i  ve accomplished by watching this was to ruin one more childhood memory . creepshow  will now join rad among my list of tainted childhood classics .      ,0
featuring a fascinating performance by will smith and a story that tugs at your heartstrings harder than a rock guitarist mid  solo   seven pounds  races past the director  s previous collaboration with the actor  the pursuit of happiness   a flick which i also loved . remember gabriele muccino  s name because some of his movies may skip by unnoticed if the actor attached to the project isn  t quite so high  profile .  br    br   too bad i figured out will smith  s scheme early on  i put two and two together when he calls in his own suicide in the first scene and the scene when rosario dawson  s character is introduced as having an incurable heart  disease .  br    br   however  i still think the writer  director made the right choice putting the bookends  bookends are the first and the last scene  in that way  it  s the source of urgency and tension in the movie  finding out gradually how exactly a man can be driven to that ultimate sacrifice  and it was heartbreaking to see the relationship between smith  s and dawson  s character flourish and develop  knowing in the back of the mind always what was in store for these unlucky two .  br    br   one of my friends with whom i saw the movie thought smith  s character could have a divine gift  and i understand why his performance is almost angelic when in the presence of his seven elected ones  yet at other times he could be harsh and scary  and when he  s alone the full weight of his situation got too much for him and he breaks down completely . it  s quite a versatile performance .  br    br   lastly i can  t forget to mention the crash scene re  enactment  which was really quite stunningly done in terms of cinematography paired with music . put this on your list .  ,1
the bourne ultimatum  jason bourne  matt damon in his best role ever   the newest spy kid on the block  brings his quest for his identity to a close as he also seeks to end the cia  s latest program  blackbriar  to make super assassins like himself .  br    br   i was so psyched for this one that i watched it  s predecessors yesterday and today . identity was as brilliant as i recall and supremacy remains the weak  but still enjoyable  link in the chain for the weakest plot and  aside from a car chase which this film  s chase easily tops  slight lacking in action and suspense .  br    br   hoo boy  does ultimatum have suspense  even when you know bourne will escape the authorities  and boy do these films spotlight the police as inept   it  s still brilliant watching him do it . it  s mind  boggling to think that two guys with handguns and mopeds can create   x more suspense than anything those     million giant robots did in transformers .  br    br   chalk it up to paul greengrass  who has this idiosyncratic style of shooting stedicam a la documentary  even though he  s filming characters that are far from ordinary  in places like cia headquarters where no one within   miles would be allowed with a camcorder . he seemed to listen to my various complaints with supremacy  as the action in ultimatum is nothing less than awe  inspiring  with various implements used as weapons being a candlestick  a hardcover book  i  ll never look at those the same way again  and an electric fan  don  t ask  . the music also helped generate much suspense  and there was hardly ever a moment to not nail  bite over .  br    br   the acting is good  and the evolution of julia stiles  character  nicky  put her situation into a new highly sympathetic light . damon plays his signature role with reserve but competency  which sounds minor but that it genuinely looks like matt damon could evade the cia and interpol is something   but noticeable moments of poignancy as he still struggles to find his humanity . this longing of his for a real life could get boring  and almost did in supremacy  but just works better in ultimatum  better script  .  br    br   i am reminded of a scene in  goldeneye   the only good pierce brosnan bond film  in which sean bean  s character asks james if the martinis ever silence the screams of all the men he  s killed . bourne regrets all the people he killed  and he considers  or at least made me consider  the meaning of action without purpose  life without meaning  and how the government has transformed men into resources . albeit  resources that know krav maga and can make weapons out of anything .  br    br   sidenote it  s always bothered me that  despite being a superspy and hunted by the cia  interpol  and the police nearly anywhere he goes  that bourne never thought to make even the smallest attempts to disguise his features or forge some new passports . sunglasses maybe   br    br   if you have a pulse and love action movies  than bourne ultimatum is for you . hell  it  s probably the best action film to come out this year . of course  you  d be a fool to see it without watching the others first . it kind of drags a touch near the end  but i almost feel tempted to overlook that . this is the first    movie this summer to at least match  if not exceed  the original and that is saying something .  br    br   a   ,1
okay  i  ll admit the casting in the film is really strange   part of this is due to the plot  but i still had a bit of trouble believing pierce brosnan playing this lead  though he really did a pretty good job  .  br    br   it  s based on a true story of an englishman who went to live with the canadian indians in the early   th century . he claimed to be a mixed blood indian . he was  in fact  so successful and well thought of that people came from all over to hear his lectures and be taken on his wilderness treks   even though he was not a mixed blood indian and all his knowledge was from books or faked  the movie centers on this and what occurred when the hoax was uncovered .  br    br   the acting and settings were great and i really liked the film  once i suspended disbelief about brosnan  . it didn  t get widespread distribution   probably because it was pretty cerebral   not a bond film nor a romance   just a really odd film about a remarkable man .  ,1
harsh  yes  but i call  em like i see  em .  br    br   i saw this in the late    s  and it was truly one of the most awful  boring films i  ve ever forced myself to watch .  br    br   yes  the cinematography is lovely . the czech settings are truly stunning . the political backdrop is enticing  but unlike similar  historically set  stories  e . g .  dr . zhivago   qv    this one failed to make the politics relevant to the story  or even interesting .  br    br   sure  olin and binoche are beautiful . but this film manages to make even  erotic  scenes plodding and slow . i  m all for romance  but this movie was so boring  i started hoping the russians would shoot them all and put an end to my misery .  br    br   i  m sure if i  d read the book  the story would have made a bit more sense . however  life  s too short to expend any more time on this one .  ,0
the only reason i saw this movie was for jimmy fallon  who i  ve had a crush on since  th grade  which was his first year on snl . i am a die  hard yankees fan  and i didn  t find the movie painful until the last   minutes  when they begin showing clips of the alcs games . i had to cover my ears and make small noises so i wouldn  t have to hear that which must not be heard  but otherwise it was completely bearable .  br    br   i thought jimmy played the role very well  because the character was supposed to be nervous and quirky  and he is a nervous and quirky guy . i know that it may not be a academy award  winning stretch  but the movie is just a light  fun  romantic comedy that is actually appropriate for both women and men to see .  br    br   jimmy and drew worked well together  and they had much better chemistry on camera than other actors in the past .  ed burns and angelina jolie in that stupid movie  what   i think jimmy has a positive career ahead of him  and thank goodness  because taxi could have killed it . i think fever pitch will help him out a lot . everyone needs to stop being so critical of his acting ability because he is just starting out in movies . i imagine it must be difficult  and if you look at any of the other great actors of our time  tom hanks  russell crowe  etc  you  ll see that they started off in some flops . busom buddies  australian soap operas  here  s wishing jimmy a successful career on screen . i never wanted him to leave snl but what can you do   ,1
after having seen deliverance  movies like pulp fiction don  t seem so extreme . maybe by today  s blood and bullets standards it doesn  t seem so edgy  but if you think that this was     and that the movie has a truly sinister core then it makes you think differently .  br    br   when i started watching this movie nothing really seemed unusual until i got to the  dueling banjos  scene . in that scene the brutality and edge of this film is truly visible . as i watched drew  ronny cox  robocop  go head to head with a seemingly retarted young boy it really shows how edgy this movies can get . when you think that the kid has a small banjo  which he could of probably made by hand  compared to drew  s nice expensive guitar  you really figure out just how out of their territory the four men are .  br    br   as the plot goes it  s very believable and never stretches past its limits . but what really distinguishes this film  about four business men who get more than they bargained for on a canoe trip  is that director john boorman  excalibur  breaks all the characters away from plain caricatures or stereotypes . so as the movie goes into full horror and suspense i really cared about all four men and what would happen to them .  br    br   the acting is universally excellent . with jon voight  midnight cowboy  enemy of the state  and burt reynolds  boogie nights  striptease  leading the great cast . jon voight does probably the hardest thing of all in this film and that is making his transformation from family man to warrior very believable . unlike reynolds whose character is a warrior from the start  voight  s character transforms over the course of the movie . ned beatty  life  is also good in an extremely hard role  come on getting raped by a hillbilly  while ronny cox turns in a believable performance .  br    br   one thing that really made this movies powerful for me is that the villains were as terrifying as any i had ever seen . bill mckinney and herbert  cowboy  coward were excellent and extremely frightening as the hillbilly  s .  br    br   overall deliverance was excellent and i suggest it to anyone  except for people with weak stomachs and kids .      . see this movie .  ,1
my observations postwar hilarity . tom drake and grandpa from  meet me in st . louis  two years later  the year i was born  . donna reed charming and pretty . margaret hamilton good as always smaller part than in  wizard of oz  . spring byington way prettier  also with the prerequisite perky small nose lacked by hamilton . tent scene at end with former boy next door was hilarious . as a two year veteran of army tents  he looked pretty youthful and inexperienced when i looked into his eyes .  br    br   i used to work in a department store  and it was just as elegant as this one . sadly  it has disappeared and faded into obscurity . we were famous for those great show windows that were used to lure passersby into the store  to get them to buy all of that wonderful merchandise .  br    br         ,1
watching this stinker constitutes cruel and unusal punishment at the hands of sandler . truly a slow and painful death .  br    br    bought the dvd in the   .   bin at wal mart . but the thought that keeps echoing in my head is   how can i get my money back    br    br   the most unforgivable thing about the movie is that the boat just does not sink   br    br   best constructive suggestion mystery comedy theatre . you know that show on the scifi channel in which some guy and his muppet  machines spoof the most unwatchable horror flicks  mystery science theatre  . immediately  spin off a comedy program and feature this flick . without a good humorous spoof of this train wreck  i fear that viewers may actually begin following sandler with ice picks and chainsaws .  br    br    ,0
i agree with  jerry .  it  s a very underrated space movie  of course  how many good low  budget ones aren  t underrated   if i remember correctly  the solution to the mystery was a sort of variation  but not  rip  off   of      because the computer controlling the spaceship had actually been a man  who had somehow been turned into a computer . and like hal  they tried to disconnect his  mind   but not the mechanical parts of him  and as with hal  it led to disaster . there is at least one funny moment . when the christopher cary character  who can  t find any food  finds the abandoned pet bird  there  s a kind of ominous moment  but then the obvious thing doesn  t happen after all .  ,1
i haven  t seen  henry fool   but after watching  fay grim  i  m not sure i want to . maybe hartley aims to be the  anti  thriller  director    he sure succeeded with this yawner . based on the official description    woman discovers that her dead husband  s manuscript contains material that could pose a threat to national security    i expected a taut geopolitical drama . instead i got flimsy structure  goofy dialog  flabby characterizations  a convoluted plot  and a  tone  that shifts so often it suggests that hartley changed the script according to his mood at any given time . i can hang for a long time with a frustrating  hard  to  follow plot  e . g .  duplicity   because i figure that the loose ends eventually will come together . even when they don  t  or they do but they leave lingering questions  e . g .  duplicity    sharp writing and acting can hold one  s interest . but half  way through  fay grim  i reached a deadly realization    i didn  t know what was going on  and i didn  t care . too bad  because i really like parker posey  reduced here to working with an absurd part that asked her to morph from indifferent  estranged wife and indifferent  clueless mother to tough  shrewd international  player  capable of psychological mano a mano with terrorists . there  s also bad casting . jeff goldblum can be very good  but he  s not capable of overcoming miscasting as a cia operative . he looks almost as uncomfortable in the role as i was watching him in it . his cia sidekick is worse he looks like a refugee from the quarterfinals of  american idol   are there really young cia agents with big licks of hair rakishly draped over their foreheads   . then there  s the sticky question of the characters  ages . goldblum was   when he made  fay grim   thomas jay ryan  who plays  henry fool   was   . neither was made to look or seem older than their actual ages . yet  a key point in the story is that they served as cia agents in nicaragua  back in the    s .  goldblum  s character would  ve been in his   s then henry fool would  ve been a teenager . was hartley being  quirky  or lazy  the problems are too numerous to list . . .  ,0
since the start of her career in the    s and vastly throughout the exuberant    s  elvira  cassandra peterson  has grown into a modest icon and genuine cult figure in the world of horror  bad monster movies . while ms . peterson has taken on various supporting roles in motion pictures  covering a wide variety in genres  it was her tv  character elvira that brought her the most fame . part of her charm  and respect from the fans  lies in the fact she never turned her back on the horror genre that made her famous  unlike many other big name actors  actresses that like to distantiate themselves from their  early  work  . i  ve seen only bits  pieces of her tv performances  but her cameo role in ghoultown  s recent tribute song  mistress of the dark  really encouraged me to check out more of her stuff . one thing had been clear to me already long before this music video over the years  elvira had become a force of influence herself by the time the mid     s came around .  br    br   and in      after films like  fright night  and  terrorvision  incorporated homages to and spoofs on her tv  work  it finally happened  elvira  mistress of the dark   the motion picture . now  i had seen the trailer for it already back in the vhs rental days  but it took me until last week to finally see the actual film . a few years ago  i did manage to watch  elvira  s haunted hills   made in       but for some reason it didn  t impress me all that much . was it really that forgettable  or should i give it another watch  i actually really do feel like re  watching it now  as this first elvira film from    really convinced me . though perhaps partly responsible for making this film work  might be sam egan and john paragon with their contributions to the script  there really is no way to deny it cassandra peterson has a great feel for comedy  she also co  wrote the screenplay  .  br    br   when elvira learns she  s one of the beneficiaries of a great aunt  she never heard of before   she takes it as the long cherished opportunity to start up her own show in las vegas . out to claim her rightfully inherited money  she travels to a quiet new england town . but the uptight townspeople of falwell are in for a treat . in less than no time she manages to shock and insult all noteworthy inhabitants of the conservative little town with her  often unintentionally  provocative behaviour . to make things worse  her inheritance turns out not to be what she expected a rundown mansion  a cookbook and a poodle . but what she doesn  t know  and her evil uncle vincent albot does  is that her great aunt was a witch  and the cookbook contains recipes to concoct the most hellishly dark powers imaginable . and if you haven  t turned off the movie yet by the time elvira has cooked up her first dish from the recipe  book  then rest assured  you  re going to sit out this ride with a smile on your face .  br    br   it  s surprising how a script rigged together with boob  jokes  witty one  liners  movie references  inside jokes and bade taste merriment also manages to tell a coherent story . simple  of course  but coherent . while other movies  heavily relying on gag  like situations  often make you loose track of the story completely  like the  naked gun  films  for example   this film doesn  t . a lot of horror  comedies were being produced during the    s  but not a lot of them actually worked . let alone a horror  spoof that doesn  t derail at some point   killer party   although i  m grateful for this one going completely bonkers during the finale  or becomes too tedious too quickly   saturday the   th   . although  elvira  is more comedy than horror  it doesn  t loose track of what it  s doing and consistently builds up towards a mildly grotesque finale  complete with a supernatural showdown in the streets of falwell between newborn witch elvira and evil uncle wizard talbot  including a real honest  to  god witch hunt and elvira  s very own burn  at  the  stake moment .  br    br   i  m telling you  there  s no power in hell that could make this movie unfunny . one of the first giggles i got was during the opening credits already  when daniel greene  s name appeared . daniel who  oh yes  i recognized his name  and later on his dim  witted macho  face  . how can one not forget daniel greene once you  ve seen . . .  atomic cyborg aka fists of steel   but if you haven  t seen  atomic cyborg   then i  m sorry  but you won  t be able to laugh with his face in this one . and on a side  note i never could have imagined elvira looking this cool while ignorantly driving away from a gas station . even robert rodriguez could not have made that shot look any better .  ,1
one of boris karloff  s real clinkers . essentially the dying karloff  looking about    years older than he was  is a scientist in need of cash to finish his experiments before he dies . moving from morocco where his funding is taken over by someone else he goes to the south of france where he works a s physician while trying to scrap enough money to prove his theories . desperate for money he makes a deal with the young rich wife of a cotton baron who is dying . she will fund him if he helps her poison the husband so she can take his money and carry on with a gigolo  who i think is married  . if you think i got that from watching the movie you  re wrong  i had to read what other people posted to figure out happened . why  because this movie had me lost from two minutes in . i had no idea what was going on with its numerous characters and multiple converging plot lines . little is spelled out and much isn  t said until towards the end by which time i really didn  t care . its a dull mess of interest purely for karloff  s performance which is rather odd at times . to be honest this is the only time i  ve ever seen him venture into bela lugosi bizarre territory . its not every scene but a few and makes me wonder how much they hung out .  ,0
i  m a big fan of morgan freeman .  the shawshank redemption  ranks at the top of my all  time favorite movies . but i have to admit that i have often wondered about his choice of roles . so many of his titles were big budget clichs with no heart .    items or less  for me marks the return of freeman to a role that truly showcases his considerable acting talents .  br    br   freeman plays an unnamed  formerly big time hollywood actor who hasn  t worked in several years . he has been offered a part in an unspecified indi picture for which he is doing some research at a grocery store in a poor neighborhood in la . after being stranded there by his flaky driver  freeman is offered a ride home by checkout girl scarlet  paz vega   whom he has semi  befriended . before she can take him home  however  scarlet has a big job interview she needs to get to  and freeman agrees to tag along in exchange for the ride .  br    br   the movie follows scarlet and freeman to several locations  but the movie is really just a character piece about the interactions between the two . freeman is the quintessential disconnected hollywood type who hasn  t heard of target  and doesn  t know his own telephone number or even what day of the week it is . he spouts wisdom from the dalai lama filtered thru his  the whole world is but a stage  mentality  and repeatedly calls scarlet  s job interview an  audition  . and yet he has a way with people  a way of affecting them that extends beyond his fame . he is a fan of humanity . he studies them  asks incessant questions about them  and delights in their quirks where others would simply be annoyed . in scarlet  he sees the stubborn  proud loner that he was he sees the man he used to be .  br    br   scarlet  for her part  displays a fierce pride and sharp tongue that serve to hide her own insecurities about herself . vega plays the role with a connection to freeman that skates the line between an almost daughterly love and physical attraction  although she plays it beautifully and it  s not at all as creepy as it sounds . but even as she feels her connection to freeman grow  scarlet has a keen eye for the reality of their different worlds and cuts thru freeman  s hollywood bullhit with a sharp pragmatism that refuses to accept anything but the truth .  br    br   the movie is smart  funny  and well written  with dialogue that is simple but effective . i read one imdb review that said the lines were  stilted   which i think is a misinterpretation of realistic human speech . there are no big soliloquies here  no deep soul searching moments . and so the trick is  i think  to show how people in ordinary  everyday life can forge connections with one another . and i think freeman and vega pull it off beautifully  painting a picture of a bond between two people that glitters like sun on the ocean  ethereal and elusive . long after it  s gone it lives on in your memories  tantalizing you with what might have been . ok  that was a bit flowery  but i really did like the performances and the movie . i would definitely recommend it .  ,1

this film is quite simply one of the worst films ever made and is a damning indictment on not only the british film industry but the talentless hacks at work today . not only did the film get mainstream distribution it also features a good cast of british actors  so what went wrong  i don  t know and simply i don  t care enough to engage with the debate because the film was so terrible it deserves no thought at all . be warned and stay the hell away from this rubbish . but apparently i need to write ten lines of text in this review so i might as well detail the plot . a nob of a man is setup by his evil friend and co  worker out of his father  s company and thus leads to an encounter with the russian mafia and dodgy accents and stupid  very stupid plot twists  devices . i should have asked for my money back but was perhaps still in shock from the experience . if you want a good crime film watch the usual suspects or the godfather  what about lock  stock . . . . thats the peak of the contemporary british crime film . . . . .  ,0
fantastic movie . one to excite all  senses . is not a true historical report and not all information is to be taken as factual information . true hollywood conventions used  like playing a list and very attractive actors as the  heroes   such as naomi watts  julia cook  ned kelly  s lover   heath ledger  ned  and orlando bloom  joe byrne  ned  s right hand man   and unattractive  sorry geoffrey rush  actors play the drunken and corrupt victorian police force . this also instills a very unreliable love story into the mix between ned  ledger  and julia cook  watts  to entice all the romantics  females being especially susceptible . even from the first scene  when ned saves the fat youth from drowning and his dad calls him  sunshine  and had a  glint in his eye as he looked down at me  his hand on me shoulder   it is very romanticized and persuades viewers to side with ned kelly  the underdog . besides  don  t all aussies love an underdog   ,1
besides the fact that it was one of the few movies that i ever shed a tear over  bye  bye manhood   this is one of the most beautifully crafted indian films that has ever been made . from the finely crafted sets  to those haunting looks meena kumari gives  no one can ever forget it . the music of pakeezah is amazing  all the more if you can understand the sublime poetry  and is definitely one of those  omg   minutes another song  movies . you get the feeling of how trapped sahibjaan is in among all the amazing jewelery she wears and fountained court yard she casually walks past .  br    br   a parody of all the dreams you  ve ever had . . . . . . . . . .  ,1
this movie was clearly done poorly and in a rush . i realize that the funding for any such movie is hard to come by . however if the plot had any kind of original substance someone would have seen that it got the necessary funding  this was not the case and movies like this are not necessary themselves and have no purpose in existing . the plot for this movie has been done and done better i might add  many times before . there is no reason to make a movie that has no chance in competing with any others . i was informed by my computer that i need a minimum of ten lines to submit my comment so the following lines are just bull to fill in space . in my opinion there is no need for anything else to be said about this film . what i  ve said is plenty and if you wasted enough time reading this review  than for god  s sake don  t waste more time watching this movie . the only exception to this is if you are the kind of person who likes watching crappy movies that get played on the womens entertainment network at     a . m . in that case go ahead see what i care .  ,0

a double life has developed a mystique among film fans for two reasons the plot idea of an actor getting so wrapped up into a role  here othello  as to pick up the great flaw of that character and put it into his life and that this is the film that won ronald colman the academy award  as well as the golden globe  as best actor . let  s take the second point first .  br    br   is anthony john colman  s greatest role  or even his signature role  i have my doubts on either level  but it is among his best known roles . most of his career  ronald colman played decent gentlemen  frequently in dangerous or atypical situations . he is bulldog drummond  cleaned up in the goldwyn production not to be an arrogant racist  fighting crime . he is raffles  the great cricket player and even greater burglar  trying to pull off his best burglary to save a friend  s honor . he is robert conway  the great imperial political figure  who is kidnapped and brought to that paradise on earth  shangri  la . he is dick heldar  manfully going to his death after he learns his masterpiece has been destroyed and knowing he is now blind and useless as an artist . i can add sidney carton and rudolf rassendyll to this list . but here he is not heroic . in fact he is unconsciously villainous  he murders one person and nearly kills two others . it does not matter that he is obviously mentally ill  his behavior here is anti  social .  br    br   to me colman should have gotten the oscar for heldar  or carton  or conway  all more typical of his acting roles . but the academy has a long tradition of picking atypical roles for awarding it  s treasure to it  s leading members . colman  s anthony john is a very good performance  and at one point truly scary . when alone with signe hasso in her home  she at the top of a staircase and him at the base  they have an argument . she demands that  tony  leave  saying she won  t see him . he stares at her  his face oddly hardening in a way he never used before  and he says   oh  no you won  t   he starts moving upstairs  frightening hasso  and she runs into her room . he stops himself and leaves . it actually is the real highpoint of his performance  even more than his assaulting of hasso on stage  or of edmond o  brien  or his killing of shelley winters . it showed his blind fury . for that moment it was  to me  an oscar  worthy performance . but it is only that moment . i  m glad he was recognized for the role  but he should have gotten the award for a more consistent performance .  br    br   his actual performance in the shakespearian role of othello is not great  but bearable . too frequently he lets the dialog roll off his tongue in a kind of forced singing style  one wonders if that was due to the coaching of walter hampden  who probably knew how to handle the role properly  or a reaction to it  . nowadays  othello  is played by an african american actor more frequently than a white one . paul robeson  s brilliant performance in the role set that new tradition firmly into place . but the three best known movie performances of the part are those of colman  orson welles in his movie of othello  and laurence olivier in his movie of his play production of othello . all three white actors did the role in black face . my personal favorite of the three is welles  who seems the most subtle . but even watching welles  fine film version makes me angry that robeson never got to put his performance  with jose ferrer as iago  on film .  br    br   now the first question  can an actor get that wrapped up in a role  i heard different things about this . some actors have admitted taking a role home with them from the theater or movie set . others have found a role they have to be stimulating  influencing them on a new cause of action regarding their lives or some aspect of life . but actually i have never heard of anyone who turned homicidal as the result of a role . it seems a melodramatic  hackneyed idea .  br    br   as a matter of fact it was not a new idea in     with cukor  kanin  and gordon . in     a  b  feature  the brighton strangler  starring john loder  had used a similar plot about an actor who is playing an infamous  jack the ripper  type  and who starts committing those type of killings after an accident affects his mind . there was an earlier movie in the     s  in which an actor playing othello gets jealous of his wife  i think the title was men are not gods  but i  m not sure  . but due to colman  s name and career  and cukor  s directing  it is a double life that people think of when they recall this plot idea . it even reached comedy  finally  on an episode of cheers  where diane chambers is helping an ex  convict who may have acting talent  and they put on othello at the bar  just after he sees her with sam malone kissing . only diane is aware of the personality problem of the ex  convict  and can  t delay the production long enough  she tries to start a discussion into the history and symbolism of the play  .  br    br   the cast of a double life was first rate  and cukor  s direction was as sure as ever . so the film is definitely worth watching . but despite giving colman an interestingly different role  it was not his best work on the screen .  ,1
what horrible writing and acting . no personality . what  you can  t make a good movie with a single character  hmm  it was done in castaway with self dialog .  br    br   so this kid goes on a trip to see his father . the kid  jason  takes a plane and the pilot has a heart attack and dies mid  flight . so the kid crashes in a lake and survives . then he runs around  surviving in the wilderness until he gets rescued .  br    br   during that time he fights a bear twice . the first time he fights it off in the lake . the second time he makes a spear out of a branch and spears the bear . two shots of fake blood spurting out of the bear  s chest reminded me of monty python  s  the holy grail  .  br    br   also the kid decides to kick a porcupine with predictable results .  br    br   gag .  ,0
the genre of suspense films really takes a dive in this one . the big problem is implausability . i realize that you need to create difficult situations which would cause suspense and the tense feeling of whats going to happen next  but this movie was so predictable  and is just not believable . i find that the more i watch this kind of movie  the more i am continually saying things to actors to direct them away from danger . continually making bad decisions just borders on being plain stupid . if they took the time to make it more realistic  i might have enjoyed it a little . having said that  you might be better off staying away from this one .  ,0
this movie took the jerry springer approach to super  human power .  wilder napalm  is the kind of theme  based movie that i love  addressing the idea that prodigies in america are defined either by their gifts or by attempts to hide them . at the same time  the movie points out that every prodigy is only human  and no more to be feared or worshipped than any other human being . this was a great comedy  fun and human with that slight satiric edge .  ,1

i  ll have to add dissenting comment here . various reviews i have read compared this movie to the likes of those by wong kar wai or hou hsiao  hsien . i . e . one of the admirable flotilla of mandarin goodies that have come our way in recent years . unfortunately this isn  t quite accurate . the film plays out rather like a film school graduate  s attempt to emulate these masters . all the pieces are there  the beautiful backdrop  the vaguely minimalist dialogue  the slow swaying camerawork  and male leads  in particular  who spend a fair whack of time sitting around being contemplative . sounds good but unfortunately nothing is up to par . the dialogue is leaden . the acting is generally unable to lift the characters above type the married couple and the little sister are particularly poor and uninvolving . unfortunately when mediocre character acting is combined with a classical  chekovian   i . e . very predictable  plot  the results are at best tedious and at worst painful . i couldn  t help but see the  blue danube  river scene  for example  as verging on genre parody  although the smoggy looking  springtime  sky over the river did provide a bit of black humour . . .  i actually went to this movie on the basis that mark li ping was photographing it . while the setting is elegant  and the swaying camera attempts to replicate the mood of  flowers of shanghai   the film is not in the same league  visually . in fact i must confess that after an hour of wondering whether it was the script or the acting that was ruining the film  i suddenly remembered that i was meant to meet my flatmate for dinner and took the chance to leave  and i can  t recall the last film i walked out of  . i  m guessing from the reviews that the ending may have left a positive aftertaste but by that point i couldn  t care . if you  d like to see something along similar lines done with real talent then i  d recommend anything by the above two directors  for example  in the mood for love  or  flowers of shanghai   both of which were filmed by the talented mr ping  the former with chris doyle   and both of which are films masterful enough to inspire years of failed emulations like this . it  s not often mr hoberman leads me astray  and perhaps you  d rather listen to him  but don  t say you weren  t warned . craig .  br    br    ,0
i  m not sure that this comment contains an actual spoiler  but i  m playing it safe  so don  t read this if you haven  t seen the movie .  br    br   i adore this movie  and so does everyone i work with   and that is the point . i spent a large part of my working life in cinema  without being an actor . such people are the  sung  heroes of this movie the gaffers  the pullers  the on  air directors  the lighters and writers  the costume people etc etc  and the whole thing is told from their point of view  at least to a great extent . most actors are nuts and self  absorbed to the point of absurdity  which is what this movie spoofs so well  but you have to have worked with actors to recognize that this movie is real  life drama  possible spoiler alert in one great scene  the two leads  both actors  are  discussing  how to  discuss  something personal  something entirely  out  of  script   with another actor  and they start making up lines  rehearsing them  and critiquing each other  s performance .  br    br   since this movie appeared in  what was it      it has become fashionable to do this  especially on tv . but hardly anyone has done it so well .  ,1
had the original casting idea been kept  hunting rutger  not ice  t   this movie might have worked . sadly  racism had to come into the picture  literally  and mess it up . the predominantly black production staff couldn  t allow the antagonist be black  so they swapped rutger  s and ice  t  s roles . this was only the start of the downward spiral of this film . ernest dickerson  s news  room approach to  directing  only verified that this was another affirmative  action job assignment . master shot  close up  close up . gads   who  s line is it anyway  even uses more creative camera work . eric  s rewrite of  the most dangerous game  is at least an attempt at modernizing the classic tale  but fails to give us any motivations for why the characters are doing this . we are never given the reasons  other than  no one will miss these people   why the leader  re  written as rutger  does these things . aside from a heart  felt performance by john mcginley  and a fair job by charles dutton  do not bother with this one . one small bit of trivia  there was a real drunk  driving accident during filming that injured f . murray abraham  and resulted in the death of the intoxicated young driver that caused the accident .  ,0
if the screenwriter and director intended to open hearts with the movie as the musician wanted to do with his music  they succeeded with me . commonplace human situations became original  personal and immediate so that i personally felt touched by each situation . i believe i would credit the power of music combined with the point of view of the person writing the movie . without spoiling  i can say that i was very moved by the movie  s approach to living . haven  t actually cried out of  what  joy  empathy  just deep emotion  in a very long time . i would love to find a way to show it to others . saw it at seattle international film festival .  ,1
i watched this film over a hundred times . it is really best serbian movie made ever . i wood like to recommend this movie to everyone . it is very good comedy . i surely like it      ,1
i  m sorry to say this  but the acting in this film is horrible . the dialogue sounds as if they are reading their lines for the first time ever . perhaps i got the  dress rehearsal  version by mistake . the director over  uses slow motion during special effects perhaps as an attempt to compensate for the poor performance of the actors themselves . the story is pretty well written  and the fight sequences are actually better than i have seen in many action films . the fights seem pretty real . but all of this happens while to two leading actors time and time again miraculously survive incredible amounts of point  blank automatic weapon fire  grenades  morter rounds  and bazookas . the enemy soldiers are definitely some of the worst shots i have ever seen  especially when they have the escaping truck in their sights from about   yards  and every bazooka shot is wide by at least   feet . those bazookas need serious site calibration .  ,0
fred gwynne  al lewis  sid caesar  and yvonne de carlo star in this funny  funny movie . the late fred gwynne is truly wonderful as herman munster who lives with grandpa munster  al lewis   wife lily  yvonne de carlo   and his son and daughter . sid caesar is hilarious as the owner of a wax museum that has a whole section dedicated to the munster family . when the wax figures of herman and grandpa begin to terrorize the town everyone blames the two . the two now have to clear their names before it  s too late . you  ll laugh out loud just like i did .  ,1
this movie is god awful . not one quality to this movie . you would think that the gore would be good but it sucks bad . the effects are worse and the acting if you can call it acting is the worst i  ve ever seen . this movie was obviously shot on a camcorder and runs on a budget around    dollars probably . if you want to watch a good zombie movie than watch dawn of the dead or day of the dead . if you want to watch a good cheap shot on video zombie movie like this but way better than watch redneck zombies . please avoid this movie at all costs . it is unwatchable and pointless . you  ve been warned . i  ve got nothing else to say about this stupid movie .  ,0
baseketball is one of the funniest movies i have ever seen . it is an off  the  wall movie starring south park creators matt stone and trey parker . they play two slacker friends who create a sport in their driveway which goes on to become a national sensation . most of the gags are indeed hilarious but the funniest parts of the movie is when players attempt to  psyche  out  other members of the opposing team . there is no rule about what is not allowed  so naturally they do the craziest things possible . one flaw of this movie is that the pace is way too fast  and after watching for about half an hour i found myself asking  wow this this over already   another hilarious part of the movie was how joe and doug continuously harass squeak  who is a hyped  up little guy . baseketball is a comedic classic with some very quotable lines  and it is very fun to watch   ,1
when i was a kid i watched this many times over  and i remember whistling the  happy cat  song quite often . all the songs are great  and actually memorable  unlike many children  s musicals  where the songs are just stuck in for no real reason . the scenes and costumes are lavish  and the acting is very well  done  which isn  t surprising  considering the cast . christopher walken is very catlike  and doesn  t need stupid make  up  or a cat costume for the viewer to believe he  s a cat transformed to a human . and jason connery  s so cute  as the shy and awkward miller  s son  corin  who falls in love with beautiful and the bold princess vera . this is a really fun  enjoyable  feature  length movie  where unlike most fairytales  the characters are given personalities . some of my favourite parts are when puss makes corin pretend he  s drowning at the ball when everybody starts dancing a country dance  as it  s  all the rage abroad   when walken is in the kitchen  dancing on the table  he  s a pretty good dancer  too    and when vera tells corin all the things she used to do when she was young  like pretending she was a miller  s daughter . i  d recommend this film to children and parents alike  who love magic and fairytales . and it actually is a movie you can watch together  as it won  t drive adults up the wall .  ,1
usually  i know after the first minute of a movie if i will hate it or adore it . . . but now  i was wrong .  br    br   the start was great the  this is based on a true story  and blah blah blah thing was funny . after  the cartoons and the description of the guys  life with pictures made me think i had made the right choice .  br    br   then  seeing the hilarious fake look of toronto was cool . also  the situation and appearance of the house seemed to confirm my first idea .  br    br   that was maybe the first   minutes of the movie . . . which afterwards looked like an eternity .  br    br   maybe that  s just me not understanding english canadian humour  that  s possible  english canadians also do not always understand quebecois humour   but hey . . . there was enough stuff in that for a short movie  nothing more . maybe that could be a meaning for the title  anyway  almost everything was filling  and very few things were even close to funny in my opinion .  br    br   as a matter of fact  the  making of  was better than the movie . at least you understand the motivation behind that which made everything bad . the potential of the idea was great that  s why i rented the movie  being interested in the  annoying people disappearance  thing . but yet  i did not know the whole universe would vanish  and with it even a point to the movie .  br    br   if you are english canadian  it seems you could appreciate the local humour  considering the surprising number of people who gave this movie an  . otherwise  just think twice before losing your precious time . . .  ,0
i love the movie . it brought me back to the best time of my life .  br    br   we need that time again  now more than ever . for me it was a time of freedom  learning  and finding myself . i will always miss it . there will never be another time like the    s  unfortunately .  ,1
even longtime shirley fans may be surprised by  now and forever .  the movie was filmed with paramount studios  not with shirley  s parent company twentieth century fox  in      before fox producer darryl zanuck had perfected the successful shirley formula  cute songs  cold hearts for her to melt  young couples for her to play cupid to  happy endings  . thus  now and forever  falls into the category of a shirley vehicle without the standard shirley story . it is an awkward position for any movie  but this impressive  talented cast makes it work .  br    br   gary cooper and carole lombard star as fun  loving  irresponsible con artists jerry and toni day . the only thing that this devoted yet dysfunctional duo seems to hate more than being together is being apart . when they are suddenly landed with custody of jerry  s young daughter penny  shirley temple   it is toni  and not penny  as many believe  who persuades jerry to give up his criminal career . but jerry flounders at his desk job  and desperate to prove that he can provide for his new family  he soon returns to thieving and dishonesty . in a standard shirley device  penny tries to melt the heart of crusty curmudgeon felix evans  the victim of one of jerry  s cons  but her attempt fails  for evans is revealed to be a con artist himself  and he blackmails jerry into helping him steal jewels . the drama  gunfight  death  and sorrow that follow all make this film a very unusual one for little miss sunshine . there is no happy ending  no dancing  and only one song sequence  the cute number  the world owes me a living   .  br    br   but this does not mean that shirley fans should avoid  now and forever .  rather  it  s divergence from the usual shirley story make it more interesting and memorable than many of her other films . but beware you should avoid colorized version of this film  and see it in black  and  white if you can . the color is bright  garish  and unrealistic  and in many scenes  shirley  s famous curls are actually red instead of blonde . yikes   ,1
i would put this at the top of my list of films in the category of unwatchable trash  there are films that are bad  but the worst kind are the ones that are unwatchable but you are suppose to like them because they are supposed to be good for you  the sex sequences  so shocking in its day  couldn  t even arouse a rabbit . the so called controversial politics is strictly high school sophomore amateur night marxism . the film is self  consciously arty in the worst sense of the term . the photography is in a harsh grainy black and white . some scenes are out of focus or taken from the wrong angle . even the sound is bad  and some people call this art   br    br    ,0
stranger than fiction angered me so much  i signed up on imdb just to write this review . stranger than fiction is a surprisingly complex  touching and thought  provoking movie until the very end . once you suspend multiple lapses of logic  why didn  t will ferrell hear emma thompson  s voice   years ago when she fist started writing her book   the phone rang . the phone rang again .  how could she not know it  s him calling  etc .   the movie challenges one  s thoughts about mortality  fate  and sacrifice .  br    br   the brief history of literary themes provided by dustin hoffman should especially entertain former english majors . and maggie gyllenhaal is always a pleasure  even though will ferrell might just as easily be an ax murderer as a bumbling soul . her quick trust of him is a mighty big leap of faith .  br    br   ah  but the ending . until the very end  i would have given  out of   stars to this movie . the movie as a metaphor for life  s journey  as a tribute to the notion of  writing true   as a reminder that great literature is either comedy or tragedy  but not both  is outstanding . the entire movie leads the viewer to understand and accept the moment of will ferrell  s fate . and no matter how endearing a character he may have become  we know full well why we will accept the ending . the last act occurs  the screen goes white  the credits roll . a profound and powerful end to an almost perfect film . an end that would have been debated for weeks .  br    br   no           no credits rolled . say it isn  t so . say hollywood didn  t tack on another   minutes of crap that completely undermined the integrity and heart of the movie . dustin hoffman got it right when he said   it  s no longer a masterpiece it  s ok .  an apt review of the movie . except to me  it wasn  t even ok . i was so offended about the betrayal of  writing true   about the decision to pander the film that i actually burst into angry tears explaining this on the ride home from the movie . i don  t often cry . i could care less about most movies  but i am still angry about this one .  br    br   my questions for zack helm  the writer  are this did the original movie end when the screen went white  and were you forced by the vapid movie powers  that  be to tack on an ending unfaithful to the core of the movie  or did you tack that maudlin ending on yourself  i  ve read you  re brilliant . i hope your original script ended the movie the first time .  br    br   i know zack helm will never see this review  and i  ve been unable to find a contact for him to ask myself . but  please  movie  goers  am i the only one who feels this way about stranger than fiction  one good thing came from me seeing this movie i doubly admire lost in translation now .  ,0

i  ve heard nothing but great things about the     television mini  series   planet earth   narrated by my childhood idol david attenborough . nevertheless  whether it was screened down here in australia or not  i never caught up with it  and when i happened upon the opportunity to see  earth         a feature  length compilation of the same nature footage  on the big screen  i jumped at the chance . the theatre was basically empty just one other patron sat in the row ahead of me  and it was as though i had  not only the big screen to myself  but  indeed  the entire planet earth . for   minutes  i was lowered into the beauty and perils of the isolated wilderness  amongst some of the most beautiful living creatures ever captured on film . awesome in its scope  and yet painfully intimate at times   earth  is a heartfelt plea from the filmmakers to recognise the delicate balance of life on our planet  and how the intrusion of humans has placed countless glorious animal and plant species on the brink of extinction .  br    br   though the film  directed by alastair fothergill and mark linfield  obviously argues for the conservation of the wilderness  it refrains from beating us over the head with propaganda  and the puzzle that is politics is ignored altogether indeed  there is not a human in sight . instead  we are simply taken on a breathtaking journey into the majesty of the natural world  to experience the resilience  and also the fragility  of life on earth . i hear that the original mini  series  which ran for eleven episodes  delves a lot deeper into the scientific background of world ecosystems  but i think that  here  the filmmakers made a wise decision to replace information with emotional impact i can  t remember the last time that i felt so inspired  and yet utterly heartbroken at the same time . by establishing an emotional link between the audience and a select few individual animals  anthropomorphising them to an extent  we are suddenly able to appreciate the  human side  of each species  and their hopeless plight for survival becomes less a statistic and more an unacceptable tragedy .  br    br    earth  is basically comprised of a selection of dramatic episodes  whether it be the struggles of a female polar bear to lead her young cubs to the arctic ice  or the tramp of an elephant herd towards the life  saving seasonal floodwaters of the okavango delta . the documentary demonstrates the delicate balance between life and death  most heartbreakingly exhibited in the desperate ballet of predator  prey interactions . though occasionally  perhaps to cater towards a younger audience  the footage cuts itself short at the crucial moment  i regularly shed at tear at the inevitability of death in nature  and the raw instinct that fuels these animals  final  hopeless efforts at survival . there  s even a haunting beauty to be found in the hunt  both in the slow  motion footage of a cheetah bringing down its prey the result of a single fateful misstep  or the majestic mid  air leap of a great white shark as it engulfs a hapless sea lion . it is this frail balance that has been fatally disrupted by the selfishness of our own species .  br    br   aside from these main stories  we are also treated to brief snippets of wildlife from around the world  including the birds of paradise of papua new guinea  and the autumn migration of the demoiselle cranes . of course  entire films might have been dedicated to these species alone  and an inevitable consequence of having to sift through so much footage is that some interesting ecosystems are glossed over far took quickly . by choosing to focus most closely on the polar bear  elephant and humpback whale  tracing their lifestyles  via some astonishing high  definition time  lapse photography  throughout a calender year  the filmmakers were able to avoid any structural problems that might arise from having so much to show  and only   minutes to show it . consequently   earth  left me thirsting for more  and  fortunately  i now have approximately eleven hours more  as soon as i can track down a copy of the dvd box  set for  planet earth .  uplifting and tear  jerking  awe  inspiring and heartrending   earth  is a truly magnificent documentary experience  and it might just be my favourite film of     .  ,1
  de grot  is a terrific dutch thriller  based on the book written by tim krabb . another of his books   het gouden ei  was made into the great dutch mystery thriller called  spoorloos    the vanishing   in     . this one is not as good as that thriller  although much better than the american remake also called  the vanishing   but there are times it comes close .  br    br   especially the opening moments are terrific . we see a man  later we learn his name is egon wagter  fedja van hut   coming from a plane in thailand . when he picks up his bags it is pretty clear that he is smuggling something across the border . these scenes are perfectly directed  photographed and acted . a kind of suspense is created that you would normally not have in an opening scene like this . later we see how egon makes his deal in thailand with a woman  both stating that they have never done anything like this .  br    br   from this point the movie is constantly flashback and flash  forward . we see how egon  still as a child  here played by erik van der horst   befriends a guy named axel  as a kid played by benja bruijning  . we learn how they grew up as friends  sort of  and how axel  as an adult played by marcel hensema  became a criminal . egon in the meanwhile goes to college and settles with a woman . around this time he sometimes meets axel but does not really want anything to do with him .  br    br   the movie is chronological in a way . it shows egon and axel as kids  than as students  young adults  and in their mid  thirties . but from time to time  like i said  the movie goes back to when they were kids and jumps forward again . every time we see them as kids it explains something that happens when they are adults .  br    br   minor spoilers herein .  br    br   the title means  the cave   and it is the cave that gives the movie its happy ending  although it is in fact not that happy . like the beginning  the ending is terrific . the middle part of the movie is entertaining and in a way it distracts our attention of the first scenes  only to come back at that point in the end . it is the editing that gives the movie its happy ending  although we can say the dramatic ending is happy in a way as well .  ,1
this particular episode of smallville is probably the best episode to air since reunion . this is for many reasons . for example  it takes the series back to some of it  s roots . it welcomes back lionel from a supposedly long absence  with the luthorcorp plaza office in metropolis . this room hasn  t been in smallville for a very long time  and seeing it again brings back many memories from the smallville  s past . not to mention  lionels conversations with lex are always admirable .  br    br   another pleasant return is  well uv guessed it  is bart allen  aka impulse   ac  aka aquaman  and victor stone  aka cyborg  . not only does steven deknight reunite the former justice leaguers  he blends them in with the smallville formula in such a unique way  that it almost feels like it is a feature length movie .  br    br   from there you get the basic story  green arrow forms the league  attempts to blow up   .   bart gets captured  clark saves him  and the facility is blown to kingdom com . all is good and graceful  with a good mix of stealth  action  pace and suspense . oh  and cyborg has some cool new upgrades true to the justice league character   .  br    br   the music is probably what makes this episode work so well . if you remember correctly  the first episode steven deknight directed was agless from season  . this was a mediocre episode  but something felt out of place . maybe it was the music  or the acting  or the fact clark sais at the end  we didn  t find you  you found us   kind of made people lose faith in the formula . but thankfully steve deknight redeemed himself in this justice episode .  br    br   i had a few quivvles about justice that made it fall short of the full   . first of all  the far too cheesy exit of the justice league from the ridge facility expolsion . i mean it would have been soo much cooler if say green arrow and cyborg took off on oliver  s bike  rememeber from the arrow episode  . clark and impulse should have obviously ran  and aquaman should have swam via another route . but that was soo incredibly cheesy  it nocked off  points from the full   .  br    br   secondly  another cheesy moment  not as bad as the first  but when green arrow sais  let  s go save the world  . that made me cringe . all in all  judging by the acting performances  music  direction and production values  the pros do outweigh the cons  and this is still one of the best episodes in smallville history  and maybe the  nd best episode in season  .  br    br    out of   . . .  ,1
i was lured to see this movie by its starpower  but ultimately that  s all it delivers . it plays much more like a greek tragedy than a modern thriller about big city corruption . it  s greatest flaw is its predictibability and utter lack of suspense . we know who the bad guys are from the beginning  and just follow along as they fall like dominoes . the film to its credit does abstain from gratuitous violence and sex  but has forgotten to substitute good  clean romance or excitement in any other way . all the flavor of a good  flat decaffeinated diet cola .  qa   which also takes place in new york  is a far better alternative  as is  la confidential  .  ,0
this movie is funny and suitable for any age . it is definitely family  type entertainment . the cast does a fine job playing folks in the mid  western town of big bean  illinois . where we must assume nothing ever happens since the excitement  pre  invasion  of the decade is the new  and only  exit ramp from the interstate . the location appeals as suitably boring and totally unlikely for the invasion of earth by martians . but these martians are totally inept  despite being well  equipped with an arsenal of suitably ghastly and deadly weapons . . . including one set on eradicating the martians  too  the martians dead  pan their lines and throw in just the right accents to make us the viewers and the locals wish to help them . . . leave earth . j . j . anderson playing the very young halloween carnivorous duck has just great lines . watch this movie for laugher and entertainment thought  provoking it isn  t . but subtle and enjoyable it is .  ,1
this work is less about steve martin  s character davis  than it is about kline  mack  and glover  simon   and kline and mcdonnell  claire   but the dialog inserted via davis is pondering  contemplative  near  poetic existentialism at its best . he is witty  intelligent  and thoughtful in both dialog delivery and content . the writers deserved an oscar .  br    br   the performances are easy  relaxed  and natural just what you would expect from  a list  actors . martin contributes the performance which leads into his more recent shopgirl  guiding you through life  love  and the pursuit of wisdom if not happiness . kline is the straight  the suit  the conformist of the film  and as such his performance is crisp and refreshing .  br    br   this work deals with life in all aspects . it engenders a true emotional investment in its characters  and leaves you feeling hopeful that mankind is not doomed  after all  no matter what you believe  deep down .  br    br   all in all  this is delightful  with a gritty moment or two  and easy natural dialog which draws you in  assisting its audience in gaining a high enjoyment from this work . it  s definitely worth your time  though it may not be every one  s top choice as friday  saturday night entertainment .  br    br   i really enjoyed the intelligence this exhibited . it  s not typical  and was an unexpected surprise . another wonderful surprise was the honesty exhibited herein . the couples and friends hold detailed conversations  which feel and sound fully honest and  again  natural . i was very impressed with this work  and will be adding it to the dvd collection soon .  br    br   it rates a  .     from . . .  br    br   the fiend  .  ,1
i first saw this film when i was about  years old on tv in the uk  where it was called  laupta the flying island   . i absolutely loved it  and was heartbroken when it was repeated a while later and i missed it . i was enchanted by the story and characters  but most of all by the haunting and beautiful music . it would have been the original english dubbed version which i saw  sometimes erroneously referred to as the  streamline dub   the dub was actually by ghibli themselves and only distributed by streamline  which is sadly unavailable except as part of a ridiculously expensive laser disc box  set .  br    br   unfortunately i feel that the release has been partly spoiled by disney . the voice acting is ok but the dialogue doesn  t have the same raw energy that the  streamline  dub or the original japanese had  and i think james van der beek sounds too old to play the lead . they have made some pointless alterations  such as changing the main character  s name from  pazu  to  patzu   and added some dialogue . but worst of all i feel that they have ruined many scenes with intrusive music  the opening scene of the airships for example was originally silent but has been spoiled thanks to disney  s moronic requirement that there be music playing whenever anyone is not speaking  which i find annoying in many disney films .  br    br   this film still blows away most recent animated films  and i cannot recommend it highly enough . the plot is simple yet captivating and the film shows a flair which is sadly missing from most modern mass  market  homogenized animation .  ,1
initially  i would have thought that secret sunshine had something critical to say of religion  and here being christianity   and wondered if it would be something of a rant against the ills of blind faith  or the manipulative power of those who are supposedly holier than thou . surprisingly  it was none of the sort and was largely non  judgemental  putting in place events as a matter of fact  and allowing the audience to draw their own judgement and conclusion .  br    br   and i can  t help but to chuckle at the role of song kang  ho  a man who  s taken a liking for widower shin  ae  jeong do  yeon   and starts going to church when she does . the reasons for church going are many i suppose  either to find inner peace  to seek help  being afraid of eternal damnation in the fires of hell  to reaffirm faith  or even things like wanting to get married in a church  or to skirt chase  i kid you not  . but to each his own reasons for turning up in church every sunday and participating in prayer groups for fellowship  what is indeed dangerous  is when the underlying ulterior motives  do not get satisfied  and that  s when frustration sets in . or when you discover how hypocritical man can be  portraying one face inside the house of god  and displaying yet another outside .  br    br   shin  ae and her son jun moves to the town of miryang  which is the birthplace of her deceased husband . wanting to start life anew  she opens up a piano shop to give lessons  though in discovering her new found freedom and in a moment  s lack of good judgement  has another tragedy befall her . and that takes one hour to get to . secret sunshine really took its time to get to this point  where things then begin to get slightly more interesting with shin  ae now taking to embracing religion to deal with and accept her current state  reveling in the comfort that religion  and fellow believers  can offer .  br    br   what began as crying out for sympathy turns into acceptance and belief that religion offers that silver bullet to solve the ills of all mankind  and sometimes you wonder if it  s because of your personal myopic view of what the almighty is doing for you  that you begin to adopt a somewhat selfish opinion that everything  s good going your way  and in shin  ae  s case  her magnanimous attitude in wanting to forgive others who had trespassed against her  forgetting something very fundamental that it the feeling can cut both ways too .  br    br   the last act is probably the most fun of the lot as it says plenty  where most of us can identify with  why me  and why not someone else  as we rage against our faith and start questioning  unfortunately  with no hard and fast answers available . it is then either we fall by the wayside  or continue with destructive deeds so rebelliously . but somehow the plug gets carefully pulled in secret sunshine so as not to offend  and what could have been an ugly character mouthpiece  got muted .  br    br   if you bite into the hype this movie is generating  then perhaps you  ll realize only jeong do  yeon  s excellent portrayal is worth mentioning  as she totally owns her role as the widow shin  ae who is probably the most unluckiest person on earth in having to deal with that many tragedies over a short period of time  and if you look at it carefully  most of which are of her own doing . watching her transformation  is worth the ticket price  and despite having my personal favourite korean actor song kang  ho in the movie  this is something he just breezed right through .  ,1
this is the first time i ever saw a movie with jamie foxx  and i bet it will be my last . i failed to see why he was funny  although people in the audience thought it was very funny when he made a face to the camera  or for saying  i am going to take a shower  .  br    br   the plot is completely predictable . the bad guy comes after the good guy . the good guy has a woman  so the bad guy uses her . in between  the officials screwing up . the final scenes are utterly unbelievable . you spend  years and millions of dollars chasing a guy  but you don  t do your home work to solve a trivial riddle   br    br   there  s no great acting  there isn  t much of a plot or storyline  and the shooting is done mtv style . don  t waste your money on this one .  br    br    ,0
i just saw this at the venice film festival  and can  t quite decide about it . we were never allowed to get close enough to any of the characters to care about them . maybe that was the point  that we are all in a  bubble  of our own  but these people didn  t compel me to be concerned about them or shocked at their various fates . at a running time of just over an hour  the characters weren  t very well developed . lots of time was devoted to shots of factory equipment  forklifts  conveyor belts  shovels   and the slightly  creepy  looking baby dolls with surprisingly lifelike eyes  that most of the characters made for a living  were somehow more interesting than the live people . an interesting experiment  but somehow it never quite came together .  ,0
i absolutely loved this movie when i was a kid . i cried every time i watched it . it wasn  t weird to me . i totally identified with the characters . i would love to see it again  and hope i wont be disappointed   . pufnstuf rocks     i was really drawn in to the fantasy world . and to me the movie was loooong . i wonder if i ever saw the series and have confused them  the acting i thought was strong . i loved jack wilde . he was so dreamy to an   year old  when i first saw the movie  not in     . i can still remember the characters vividly . the flute was totally believable and i can still  feel  the evil woods . witchy poo was scary  i wouldn  t want to cross her path .  ,1
snuggle down in your favourite chair and switch on the play  station  as you toss this into the waste disposal unit . spend a useful   min . living your favourite game . disjointed  poorly filmed  non directed junk . it takes a bits from several other  science fiction  movies and badly attempts to join the parts into a pathetically weak story . there  s nothing new here  the filmmakers do not seem to realise that providing simple entertainment would achieve a monetary game  but a touch of skill ingenuity and flair is required to turn it into a good film . any money spent watching this is a waste  and personally i would like my   min of life back .  ,0
i was looking through the movie listings in my area on yahoo and seen a movie that had not been advertised . i looked closer and noticed that peter falk and paul reiser were in it . having watched  mad about you   once  i was not a fan of paul reiser . however  i am a big fan of peter falk . so the spouse and i took a chance . we were both swept into this story . the beautiful scenery  the heartfelt acting and the sense of family and moral values that are seldom seen in movies and the world today . not that sappy emoted junk  but real life situations from real life  like people . i even have to say  paul reiser was excellent  although  i still won  t watch  mad about you  . i don  t know where this movie has gone . i heard it was put out in limited release . it should be shared with the world . it is one of the finest movies i have seen . m .  ,1
dear me . . . peter sellers was one of the most oddly talented actors there has been . but his choice of films  say  after      was very unfortunate . he didn  t seem to realize how to use his talents . he would have been better off working with more of the kubricks of the film world than the people he did . of his later films  only  the optimists of nine elms  and  being there  have impressed me of those i have seen .  br    br   that said  the boultings and sellers had made a few films prior to this that hardly sound that bad  i have yet to see  carlton browne  and  heavens above    at least in the sense of using sellers well to a degree . but   there  s a girl in my soup  really is a poor film and a dire choice on sellers  part in terms of character . in his films from         you can usually expect at least some very inventive twist and always an enigmatic conviction in his roles . here  you have peter sellers trying to play a typical romantic lead . it  s almost sellers playing a niven cad without the joviality . he certainly does not convince  try as he might  or create an interesting character . he should have left such parts to masters of suavity such as cary grant  and concentrated on those intriguing dramatic and comic roles that he was famed for .  br    br   hawn and sellers really do not establish any genuine chemistry this is no easy  genial romance of the like perfected by william powell and myrna loy . it is very artificial seeming  all the way through  i know that it is part of danvers  character that he is a dry procurer of ladies  but he doesn  t really change from that in a way that convinces . sellers has a very grating way of playing  charm  as well . . . this character really has no depth  and really does not gain the viewer  s sympathy or interest . sellers goes through the motions in a way one would not think possible when remembering the magnificence of his shifty  iconoclastic performance in  lolita  .  br    br   there really is nothing to say about the plot  direction or characters  as frankly they leave little or no impression . this is truly one of the most anaemic  complacent  misguided and lightly dull films i have ever seen . a nonentity of a  vehicle  for sellers  undisputed talents .  br    br   rating         ,0
the explosion of tv channels must be eternally grateful to the randolph scott western production line  because any any moment there must be one of what seems like a hundred randolph scott movies playing on at least one no  budget station .  br    br    man behind the gun  is a typical early      s period melodrama with pre  wwii production values that relies on a historically  topical murder mystery plot peppered with action scenes to disguise the script  s complete absence of character development  and thus lack of suspense . in years to come the role of these films would be taken over by tv shows like  gunsmoke    bonanza   etc  and these actually did the job better . randolph scott  looking particularly grizzled in this  is the good guy  struggling against the bad guys against whom he will eventually prevail . there  s no more interest in what he goes through emotionally than in what his horse is feeling  unless you count wondering whether he  ll sort out the initial misunderstanding with the female lead by the end . the music is a stronger indication of the emotional state of the  characters  than the acting is . but it  s fine if that floats your boat and i wouldn  t berate you for enjoying  diagnosis  murder   either .  br    br   workmanlike  pedestrian  and ageing rapidly .  stars for being competently put together  for artistic endeavour .  ,0
although robert  knox  benfer has his fans  i  m not one of them . his films are asinine and amateurish  and and just not very funny  unless you  re a   year old with an underdeveloped sense of humor .  br    br   he  s certainly not famous  as him immature fans would like you to believe  by harassing people at wikipedia  or stuffing the ratings votes here at the imdb . he  s certainly not been profiled by any major media outlets  which speaks volumes about his and his creation  s  fame  .  br    br   benfer does have some slight skill at limited animation  but he needs to get away from his young sycophants and learn to write some actual funny material before he  ll be taken seriously as a real entertainer . as of this moment  though  he  s just a kid with a camera  and it shows .  ,0
anyone who has read my review for uwe boll  s  alone in the dark  will remember that i compared the unenviable task of sitting through that piece of human waste to having each and every hair on your arm pulled out . well  take that analogy a step further with this irredeemable gutter trash and try to imagine the pain of getting your teeth extracted without novacaine . do that  and you  ll have a general idea of what eli roth  s  cabin fever  is all about .  br    br   i never believed any one film was capable of topping the sheer agonizing dreck that uwe boll cranks out as the  worst film ever made .  but  in all honesty  i have to say  cabin fever  comes very close . this is yet another sad excuse for a motion picture that had absolutely no valid reason to meet with any form of theatrical release . for somebody who claims to love the horror genre as much as eli roth does  he has created the single most annoying and convoluted patchwork of a movie i think i have ever seen in my entire life . how do you screw up a story like this  think of the potential this plot would have had without the poorly written characters  without the bad writing  and without all that unnecessary and unfunny comedy . a movie dealing with a grotesque flesh  eating virus could and should have been so much better than what roth dished out for us here . this script failed on so many levels with me . and  while i do not doubt the evident talent this director possesses  i do know that he fumbled the ball big time on an idea that could very well have redefined the horror genre .  br    br   to say this was a production of missed opportunities would indeed be a gross play on words . a generous amount of blood and unsettling special effects can  t even save it  and that is one element i normally go for . there really was nothing about  cabin fever  that i could easily recommend to anybody . when three quarters of the crowd walks out of the theater halfway through  you know the movie is sinking fast . my best advice to those reading this would be to simply rent before purchasing . one viewing was more than enough for me to know that i will most likely never bother with it again .  ,0
i just couldn  t stop laughing   this movie is incredibly funny and stupid  but  never mind that  it is very entertaining  in this film  you don  t need to pay attention to anything  the acting is the same  lame  the dinosaurs are the same  rubber  oh  my i could see the stick that holds t  rex head for a moment .  the raptors are the same from the carnosaur   t  rex is also the same  but . . . in some scenes his head looks kinda stuffed and it looks like some kind of project failure from kindergarten . action is fast  sometimes too fast  actually i talk about fast editing  they edited it so fast  so that we cannot see the rubber dinosaurs  but oopps  to late  they are rubber  well  only things interesting here is to see rick dean in this sequel .  br    br   what can i say . . . don  t rent it . . . watch it on tv  with friends  it is much more entertaining   ,0
this kid is rather bad  but in no way do they make him the type that outsmarts adults and can foil experienced thieves at every turn . no  he is not so much a brat  as he is a kid with severe emotional problems . a nice couple looking to adopt get rather suckered into adopting him and while the husband is a bit more willing to give this kid a chance the mother is not . through in a bizarre michael richards character and the always annoying gilbert gottfried and you have yourself a rather bad movie with a few laughs in it here and there . i actually prefer the sequel to this film as i like the fact they brought amy yasbeck back as a different more likable character as there are one to many characters in this film that are thoroughly unlikable as it is . even the kid is rather annoying at first in this one  and they kind of chill him out in the sequel too . the plot is simple enough though as the prospective parents go to adopt this kid that they think is great by the way the orphanage is throwing a party as they depart  they soon realize they have themselves a little hellion . add to that this little hellion getting into contact with a convict of some sort . not sure about this character  at first i thought it was supposed to be his real father or something . not all that good  but i will pick this ahead of that culkin kid any day of the week .  ,0
this is not really a proper review since i did not see most of the film . i stopped watching it . the film is very violent  with nasty drug dealers and street punks  but that is not why i stopped watching .  br    br   here was the problem i watched just enough to be introduced to several characters  all of whom were not interesting . everyone was a tedious  despicable psychopath  with no engaging personalities  giving me nothing to look forward to . i found myself not the least bit curious about what they would do next or what might happen to them .  br    br   if there had been even one person of interest  and i don  t mean good or nice person  i mean an interesting person  i could have stayed with it . watch  state of grace  to see what i mean . in that film the gary oldman character is a complete lunatic  but he is very interesting . al pacino perhaps did a good job in scarface  but his character just did not engage me .  ,0
perhaps the most polished and accomplished of all indian films  pakeezah does not fall into any of the traps commonly associated with bollywood film  ie tackiness  farce  wholesale and unsuccessful imitation of western film themes  genres  . pakeezah is indigenous to the sub  continent and authentic  almost madam butterfly  like in plot . characters are well  developed  direction  although sometimes unrefined by today  s standards  perceptive and convincing . the urdu  speaking milieux at the time of pakeezah were masters of understatement and how the dialogue conveys the subtleties of the age  the acting  particularly the  looks  and the dynamic between characters  are a delight to behold although the nuances may be lost on contemporary viewers or those not acquainted with the mores and customs of muslim india .  br    br   coupled  with a captivating screenplay is a beautiful musical score  enhanced by the protagonist displaying eminent command of classical indian dance  kathak  . as is the case with most romantic tragedies  the heroine must die  but she does not take her leave of the audience without the viewer feeling he  she has been party to a truly memorable cinema experience . pakeezah is surely the pinnacle of what indian cinema has produced and is unlikely to be paralleled .  ,1
it  s cheesy  it  s creepy  it  s gross  but that  s what makes it so much fun . it  s got over the top melodramatic moments that are just plain laughable . this movie is great to make fun of . rent it for a good laugh .  br    br   the film centers around three women newscasters  during a time way before cellphones . they go to a small town to cover a festival  but they can  t get a room to stay the night . and that  s when they meet ernest keller . he  s creepy in a psycho kind of way . and he offers to let them stay at his home . but he doesn  t tell them the truth about who lives there .  br    br   stephen furst  s performance is so amazing as  the unseen   that he really carries this film . most of the movie is kind of dull  although finding out the truth of ernest  s family is kind of interesting .  br    br   just seeing this cast in these scenes makes it worth a look . barbara bach and doug barr make nice eye candy .  br    br   i consider the movie an old gem  hard to find and worth a look .  ,1
how can a movie that features the singing of curtis mayfield be bad  it can  t  the groove tube is a series of scatological black  out sketches that makes fun of anything from     to the olympics . the highs   koko the clown  the easy lube recipe  outnumber the lows  an all too long  the dealers    but even the lows are funny . best of all is ken shapiro  s manic dance down a busy manhattan sidewalk .  that is shapiro  not nat king cole singing just you  just me  . definitely dated now  but at the time the groove tube was irreverent  bold  shameless and hysterically funny . ken shapiro made this minor cult hit  then  years later made the christmas day opening bomb  modern problems  though i enjoyed it and since then  unfortunately  nothing .  he could possibly be playing drums in a jazz group  the groove tube remains to me an unending burst of positive energy  a movie that   years after my initial viewing  still brings me real joy   ,1
white fire was recommended to me by a guy who owns it on two separate dvd releases and on vhs . he claimed it  s one of the funniest and coolest low budget actioners ever made . i generally don  t watch movies knowing that they  re going to be bad  but i made an exception for this one . . . and i was very glad that i did .  br    br   it  s filled to the brim with action  much of it surprisingly  graphically gory   sleaze  isolated to nudity with a key female character  but there  s so much of it in one scene that it becomes hilarious  and outrageously awkward dialogue  all of which adds to the laughter  inducing tone of the film .  br    br   ginty  the unusual looking star of the exterminator  and countless other low budget action turds  is amusing in the lead  giving the best performance he could muster . williamson is better than usual  clearly hamming it up with unparalleled glee  and he doesn  t come in until midway through  . the rest of the cast is also fun to watch  particularly the villains  one of whom is a sadistic sexpot who speaks with an accent that appears to be a mish  mash of spanish and italian . she  s priceless .  br    br   again  i can  t stress enough how gory it was . it  s not so bloody that it  s nauseating  but it  s uncommonly violent in parts with some meaty squibs going off in the shootouts and it has a grueling torture sequence that no man will soon forget . also  when ginty is being swarmed by a pack of bad guys  he conveniently gets a hold of a chainsaw and the splatter moments that follow will have any and all action fans cheering and spilling their beers .  br    br   don  t miss white fire . it  s a rollicking  if mind  numbingly stupid  action classic .  ,1
i caught this movie about  years ago  and have never had it of my mind . surely someone out there will release it on video  or hey why not dvd  the ford coupe is the star . . . . . . . if you have any head for cars watch this and be blown away .  ,1
amy heckerling  s second film johnny dangerously is a parody of      s gangster films made in the warner brothers  tradition . michael keaton stars as a middle aged gangster looking back at his life of hard knocks when he catches a kid trying to steal something from his pet store in     . keaton  s mother  maureen stapleton  has continuing health problems  so keaton falls into crime at an early age via peter boyle . meanwhile  the fargan richard dimitri plays a rival crime lord to boyle and keaton eventually rises through the ranks . joe piscopo has a hilarious turn as danny vermin  yeah that  s right  vermin  griffin dunne is keaton  s younger brother turned district attorney  glynnis o  connor his wife  and marilu henner plays keaton  s moll . the film looks notoriously cheap  making it seem like a television show instead of a theatrical film .  br    br   the film starts out great and then slows down as expected after the first half hour . due to the combination of dialog and gags  the film holds its own for the first half  but then it rapidly loses steam and descends into mediocrity and vulgarity in the second half . keaton chews the scenery doing his best james cagney impression . stapleton has several vulgar lines that are only obnoxious  not funny . piscopo does the  once  bit one time too many . several supporting actors try to hold up the fort like danny devito  dom deluise  ray walston as a street vendor  alan hale  jr . as a desk sergeant  and sudie bond as an unscrupulous cleaning lady . the second half evolves into a hit or miss television show type tone and never recovers . the closing scene utilizing the roaring twenties is an anachronism as is the call of the wild clark gable film seen on a marquee earlier in the film . i think heckerling should have known better  since the targeted audience would certainly be aware of the roaring twenties  actual     release date .     of  stars .  ,0
i would highly recommend this movie  and i certainly shall be personally recommending it to my friends and family here and abroad  it was with excited anticipation  that i have just pre  ordered it online  i enjoyed it so much  it is not out until february  march      but it will be well worth the wait  but first go and see it in the cinema if you can . there is nothing quite like the cinema  experience of a cinema  made movie  insist that your local cinema puts it on  i went to see  seachd  the inaccessible pinacle  tonight  down here in london  and was really impressed . it is a marvel a truly beautiful film set in the scottish highlands you will laugh  you will cry  you will be moved in may different ways  you will be intrigued  and as the story within the stories is revealed  you will be amazed at that revelation .  br    br   this movie is in scottish gaelic with english subtitles  but do not let that detract you if you are not a speaker of the gaelic i am just starting  and my son does not  nor did many people there tonight  and it did not spoil it for us by any manner of means  superlatives do not suffice  the photography is superb  there is no cgi here  and the movie is all the better for that  here you have true photography  the script is so skilfully and subtly written . the many  layered plot weaves the magic art of the ancient storytellers . the music is at times rousing  at times haunting  but always adding to the atmospheric ambiance . and the acting  . . . it is to behold . . . and the actors  . . . they the true weavers of this delightful yet profound film  particularly the two main actors   padruig  the  young  and  padruig  the  elder   a true bard  if ever there was    who both carried a very heavy load  and the direction  well watch out richard  and the producer  responsible for raising funding  hiring key personnel  and arranging for distributors  a task well done  i hope that you will make sure that distribution goes out to our communities abroad  and the gaelic community  uill  without you it could not have happened  we were told that this movie was made on a low budget  but you would not know it  and i think it might well be because  for what they might have lacked in money  they more than made up for with the richness of the heart  and the warmth and co  operation of the local scottish gaelic community .  br    br   a heartfelt thanks to all concerned in the making  and the sponsoring  of  seachd   mran taing   many thanks   from the gaels to the world  from the world to the gaels   ,1
this is the worst brain damaged  ultra cheap  super stupid  silly  pointless piece of trash i  ve ever seen  an unbelievable garbage of instant cult status among fans of the bizarre . if you think that ed wood  s  plan   is bad  well . . . let me tell you  looks like  citizen kane  compared to that one . special effects  . . . again   plan   is  star wars  . acting  . . . thor johnson is al pacino . . . so it  s beyond bad  really . but if you are looking for that kind of incredible movies  it  s for you  i  m a fan of american international for so many glorious horror movies  the price  corman  poe saga and some great blaxploitation stuff  but with  star creatures  they descend right down to the z level . of course  my  out of   works in reverse if you like to watch bad movies for fun  the guy playing an indian chief is great  so have fun and enjoy . . . if you can .  ,0
i gave this a four purely out of its historical context . it was considered lost for many years until it popped up out of the blue on showtime in the early nineties .  br    br   moe is the straight man and larry and curly act as a duo . spade cooley has a couple of numbers . i guess it had something to do with working on a ranch . i  m not quite sure because the plot was so minimal nothing really sticks in my memory . i vaguely remember it being a western musical comedy . even the stooge  s seem to be going through the motions . overall there  s nothing much really to recommend here .  br    br   if you  re not a stooge fan then don  t bother . if you are a stooge fan  then stick with the shorts .  ,0
intrigued by the synopsis  every gay video these days has a hunk on the cover this is not necessarily to be construed as a good sign  i purchased ben and arthur without knowing a thing about it . this is my second  and i assure you it will be my last  purchase of a culture q connection video . as far as i am concerned  this dvd is nothing but a blatant rip  off . i do not make this observation lightly  i am a major collector of videos  gay and mainstream  and i can state with some authority and without hesitation that ben and arthur is quite simply the worst film i have ever sat through in my life . period . my collection boasts over      films     on them on dvd  and of those  well over    are gay and lesbian themed . i hardly own every gay movie ever made  but i am comfortable in stating that i pretty much purchase almost every gay video of interest that gets released  and very often i buy videos without knowing anything about the film . sometimes  this makes for a pleasant surprise  aimee  jaguar  it  s in the water  urbania and normal are all examples of excellent gay titles that i stumbled upon accidentally . so when i read on the box that ben and arthur concerned a conflict between gay lovers and the christian right  one of my favorite subjects  i decided to take the plunge sight unseen  despite my previously disappointing purchase of another culture q connection title  visions of sugar plums . that film was pretty bad  but compared to ben and arthur  it viewed like gone with the wind . so what was so wrong with ben and arthur  plenty  to begin with  the  plot  such as it was  was totally ridiculous . this film almost made me sympathetic to the christian right  we are asked to believe not only that a church would expel a member because his brother is gay  but that a priest would actually set up a mob style execution of a gay couple in order to save their souls  like this even makes sense  . the writing is so poor that many scenes make no sense at all  and several plot points reflect no logic  follow  up or connection to the story . murder and violence seem to be acceptable ends to the gay activist  right wing conflict on both sides  and the acting is so bad that it  s difficult to imagine how anybody in this film got hired . the characters who are supposed to be straight are almost without exception clearly gay  and nelly stereotypes to boot the gay characters are neither sexy nor interesting . this film is enough to put off anybody from buying gay themed videos forever  and the distributors should be ashamed of themselves . the only advantage this picture has over my other culture q connection purchase  visions of sugarplams  is that this one has a soundtrack with clear dialogue . hardly a distinction  since the script is so insipid that understanding the script only serves to make you more aware of how bad this film truly is . it is an embarrassment to queer culture  and i intend to warn everyone i possibly can before they waste their money on it . at   .   this film would have been way overpriced i understand that it  s soon to be re  priced under     which is still highway robbery . i paid the original price of    .    and i never felt more cheated in my life . the only true laugh connected with this drivel is the reviews  i have seen  user reviews  for this film on numerous websites  and there is always one or two that  praise  the director  writer  actor in such a way that it  s obvious that the reviewer is a friend of this ed wood wannabe . how sad . how desperate . i just wish imdb would allow you to assign zero stars  or even minus zero . if ever a film deserved it  this is it .  ,0
i thought this was one of the best movies i  ve seen in a very long time . it was a great story line and showed that people are so intricate in all kinds of different ways . have recommended it to all my friends   i always enjoy a good story line and this movie had one of the best i  ve seen in a long time . i could see myself having a daughter and doing the same things that natalie did to find out more about her life and loves . it showed how we not only have lives with our families  but also have parts of our lives that we don  t share with them  as it may not be in their best interest to know all the details of things we don  t do that we are so proud of .  br    br   i look forward to another such movie  and will keep my eye out .  ,1
in the     s studios would use short films like this one sort of as testing grounds for new actors  given their relative ease of production in comparison with full length feature films  so it  s interesting that this one should star shirley temple  who had long since established herself as the most famous child star of all time . then again  she probably wasn  t the one being tested  i would imagine that would have been frank coghlan jr .  who played shirley  s brother sonny in the movie and delivered a comparatively less impressive performance . then again  a   year  old shirley temple was probably not an easy act to accompany .  br    br   the film opens with an unimpressive sight gag involving a leaky ceiling  which i suppose was designed to have shirley temple give a scornful look at the ceiling  illustrate the working class status of the family in the movie  and provide a clean transition into the next scene  which features shirley gleefully stomping in the rain .  br    br   it  s sonny  y birthday  and his father makes occasional and horrendously botched efforts to hide the fact that he wants to give sonny a dog that he really wants for himself  but sonny is afraid of dogs because he was bitten by one once and has been creeped out ever since . it  s curious that  when his father insists on getting a dog  sonny decides to run away from home rather than have a dog in the house  and as he is running away with no destination in sight  it  s also curious that the movie illustrates what seems to be an indifference to homeless people that surpasses even the astounding indifference that exists today .  br    br   sonny passes a man cooking bacon in an iron skillet at the side of the train tracks  right after a train flew by which  given how close to the tracks he was  you would think would have blown the guy right off the tracks  but no matter  . after sonny gives up on sharing breakfast due to the sour stare that his gleeful smile receives from the guy  he continues on and the homeless guy disappears from the movie . it  s interesting to consider what a longer film would have done  because this one leaves this poor guy as a loose end .  br    br   not that that matters  sonny soon hears a dog whining underneath a trestle as he passes over it  and jumps down to find a dog covered in burrs . it might seem trite that he immediately takes the dog up and adopts it since he just left home because of his fear of dogs  but it seemed to me that he just needed to be reminded not of his power over dogs  but of their lack of power over him . as soon as he saw a dog in need he overcame his fear .  br    br   hey  if that  s all it takes  all i have to do is find a helpless spider and i  m set   br    br   it  s a very convenient movie in which everything works out exactly as it is supposed to  but it  s cute enough and enjoyable enough  and short enough  as it were  to still be a fun movie . we already don  t expect an epic plot in a    minute film  but pardon my pups still packs in a substantial amount of story and character development in its short running time . and it also features a fight scene at the end of the movie that must have made charlie chaplin proud . i am hardly an expert of shirley temple  s films  but it  s not hard to see how she became the most famous child star of all time .  ,1
normally the best way to annoy me in a film is to include some reference to orson welles . but here is a sci  fi comedy quoting the war of the worlds broadcast . . . . and it is gold  the very concept of a small bunch of diminutive  aggressive and stupid aliens being mistaken as kids in halloween dress is magnificent . don  t be fooled by the notion that because it seems like a kids  movie it is unsophisticated  it isn  t  there  s a lot of hidden treasure . . . a gem   ,1
when i was a kid it was lex barker  s time as tarzan . i often heard from older people that johnny weissmuller  was  tarzan and i wouldn  t understand why since i saw a couple of weismuller  s last films in the character and i thought he was sort of out of shape . it wasn  t after many years that i came across  tarzan and his mate   and then i understood . weismuller is in shape in this picture and has the presence and rugged looks the character demands not matched yet by other tarzans such as barker  gordon scott  jock mahoney  denny miller  miles o  keefe and cristopher lambert .  br    br   as for this film i was also surprised by the sensual presence of beautiful maureen o  sullivan a strong  self minded  active and  no  inhibitions  woman as jane way ahead of the times in which the film was made  tarzan pushes her into a pond naked as she is amused one of the explorers kisses her by surprise and though she doesn  t kiss him back she sort of let him do for a bit and makes no big deal out of it   such behaviors were unthinkable with the  janes  to come such as brenda joyce  vanessa brown  virginia huston or dorothy hart  all playing sort of too perfect sweet vulnerable women making it hard to believe they could survive in a hostile place like the african jungle .  br    br   o  sullivan character  s sparkling personality steals the show out of tarzan himself  except of course when it comes to action and weismuller takes the lead easily the combination is perfect . another highlight in the movie is cheeta  s secondary role and not as the main lead like in later tarzan pictures where she often saves the day .  br    br    tarzan and his mate  stands as a fine product in its genre  tarzan films  and perhaps as the best  though i have to admit that i also enjoyed  tarzan  s greatest adventure        made with a higher budget and a strong supporting cast  and in spite of the just acceptable gordon scott in the leading role with his too perfect  all gymnasium  physical looks that doesn  t fit for a rustic ape man  .  br    br   good for jane and her mate   ,1
in order to rate this movie fairly you have to think about the genre it  s supposed to be children  s . they had more guidelines to follow in order to make this movie  meaning it could not get away with some of the humor and or language from the  st  taking all that in this movie was fun and enjoyable to watch . sequels usually make me nervous  however this one did pretty well for itself . knowing that it didn  t have the star power of fraiser as george they capitalized on the humor and i believe showeman did pretty well as the lead . the plot being easy to follow and maybe campy at times fits well for a younger audience  if you want to watch a movie and hope for academy award honors this is not it  but if you want to watch a simple  fun  energy filled movie you would make a good choice with this one .  ,1
i  m not a fan of adam sandler . in fact  i don  t think i  ve ever liked him in anything i  ve seen him in . the opening scene of this movie confirmed my worst fears . there was adam sandler  playing a somewhat ridiculous looking character riding around new york city on a motor scooter  looking pitiful and lost . typical sandler  type loser character again  i thought . i almost gave up then and there . but then  as i stuck with this  i actually discovered something i never knew before adam sandler can act  he is truly outstanding in this movie as charlie  a lost and lonely figure  whose entire family  including the dog  was killed in one of the hijacked planes on     and who has apparently lost all touch with reality as a result . don cheadle plays his former college roommate who unexpectedly reconnects with charlie and takes it on as his mission to help him get better . of course  cheadle  s alan johnson has his own problems and sources of unhappiness  and somehow these two men manage to help each other through their difficulties . the two of them made a completely believable team  and sandler in particular made charlie real  working through his emotions and feelings . this is not a sandler comedy . if your looking for that go to some of his other  sillier  stuff . this is a pretty heavy movie  sometimes sad  sometimes hopeful and always engrossing . there are some funny parts in it . i loved the scene in which charlie convinces alan to confront his partners by reminding him of how tough he was in college  and then the conversation the two of them have afterward .  br    br   i personally didn  t think that saffron burrows added much to the movie as donna  an obviously needy patient of johnson  s . the only reason for the character seemed  based on one flashback  to be that she looked eerily like charlie  s late wife  but that was never really developed  and i just didn  t care that much for the character . do look for the part of the judge  however  played by donald sutherland  who i thought nailed the part bang  on . as far as i  m concerned  though  this is sandler  s movie  and kudos to him for a great performance . definitely his best in my opinion .      ,1
during eddie murphy  s stand up a women from the audience yells at eddie and a man from the audience responds . what is said is   women  do mr rob  this is a character from saturday night live   the man responds with shut up bitch . unlike the previous post saying the women yelled do gumby  this is incorrect  although the post  er said he was there they must have a hearing problem  despite what the post  er says about not being able to here it on dvd have a close listen as you actually can hear it on the dvd  do mr rob     i hope this helps anyone curious out the outburst cheers gaz                                                                                     ,1
for people interested in business and the corporate world  this show is simply the best of the best . as one of the former contestants of the show wrote in his blog about this innovative show people in business finally had an audience . the whole idea is perfect having a group of businesspeople competing against each other in business  related tasks  set in the best place in the world  new york city . donald trump is perfect as the boss  even though his ego is bigger than the whole universe times infinity . he also makes a lot of questionable decisions about whom to fire  which is one of the negatives about the show .  br    br   season   great season overall  the best season of the  normal  ones . this season was the one that was most about actual business skills . later on the series almost drowned in marketing related tasks with way too many product placements . great and interesting contestants overall  with the most likable character ever in this series troy . i know i  m not the only person who suspect that the trump world tower  episode where he got fired was rigged to have amy and nick win this particular task .  br    br   season   also a great season . the tasks were still pretty much ok  and it had many interesting contestants . jen m was terrible and should never had made it to the final  imo . also  this season had the worst firing ever  pamela  .  br    br   season   terrible . actually  i liked the concept of book smarts vs . street smarts  but the cast was so utterly terrible  it turned out that trump hated the cast as well  that the whole season was a total disaster . best moments was the second episode  motel renovation   with pm brian fired  a guy who added nothing but huge amounts of comedy value .  br    br   season   an excellent season  much because of the interesting and entertaining contestants this season  especially randall  alla  marcus and the total disaster whose name was toral  . the  take me out to the boardroom  episode is one of the absolute classics of this show  ending with the well  remembered quadruple firing . sadly  i think we got robbed for the randall vs . alla final . i think trump was afraid that she could have won  and prevented that from happening .  br    br   season   a boring season with really no special things to it . brent was just an embarrassment and obviously only there to create drama . the tasks were terrible overall  how has creating a jingle anything to do with business at all   . i guess the best man won  but personally i couldn  t care less .  br    br   season   i can see why they wanted to try out l . a . as a new location for the show  but looking back it was a mistake . new york will always be the place for this . this season added so many new things  most of them terrible  like losing team having to sleep outside in tents  winning pm continues to be pm  for example  . the tasks were terrible and trump also chose the wrong winner . james deserved it  no doubt .  br    br   season   celebrity edition . best season ever . totally different rules  like the use of rolodexes   but all fun and entertainment . the biggest problem was that many of the contestants were not real celebrities at all  especially the women where everyone were unknown to me except for omarosa  who is a total disgrace to everything she takes part in . this looked to be gene simmon  s season  but after he made a complete fool of himself during the kodak task  another man emerged from the shadows piers morgan . never has anyone dominated a season like he did . he crushed his opponents and also came across as a guy with a great sense of humor  although some uptight americans  not all americans  of course  don  t take me wrong  sadly didn  t have the social skills to understand it  . way to go piers    br    br   for fans of this i highly recommend the uk version starring sir alan sugar as the boss . in fact  the british version is way better  and that says something since the american  and original  truly is a great show . one thing about the uk version is that the contestants normally tend to behave like decent human beings in the boardroom  unlike the constant yelling and rude behavior that takes place in the us version .  ,1
i didn  t at all think of it this way  but my friend said the first thing he thought when he heard the title  midnight cowboy  was a gay porno . at that point  all i had known of it was the reference made to it in that  seinfeld  episode with jerry trying to get kramer to florida on that bus and kramer  s all sick and with a nosebleed .  br    br   the movie was great  and surprisingly upbeat and not all pissy pretentious pessimistic like some movies i can  t even remember because they  re all crap .  br    br   the plot basically consisted of a naive young cowboy joe buck going to new york trying to be a hustler  a male prostitute  basically   thinking it  ll be easy pickings  only to hit the brick wall hard when a woman ends up hustling him  charging him for their sexual encounter .  br    br   then he meets enrico salvatore rizzo  called  ratso  by everyone and the cute gay guys who make fun of him all the time . you think of him as a scoundrel  but a lovable one  like han solo or lando calrissian  and surprisingly he and joe become friends  and the movie is so sweet and heartwarming watching them being friendlier and such and such . rizzo reveals himself to actually be a sad  pitiable man who  s very sick  and very depressed and self  conscious  hates being called  ratso  and wants to go to florida  where he thinks life will be much better and all his problems resolved  and he  ll learn to be a cook and be famous there .  br    br   it  s heartwarming watching joe do all that he does to get them both down to florida  along with many hilarious moments  like ratso trying to steal food at that hippie party  and getting caught by the woman who says  gee  well  you know  it  s free . you don  t have to steal it .  and he says  well if it  s free then i ain  t stealin  it   and that classic moment completely unscripted and unscheduled where hoffman almost gets hit by that taxi  and screams  hey  i  m walkin  here  i  m walkin  here     and the acting is so believable  you  d never believe joe buck would grow up to be the distinguished and respected actor jon voight  and ratso rizzo would grow up to be the legendary and beloved dustin hoffman . it  s not the first time they  ve worked together in lead roles  but the chemistry is so thick and intense .  br    br   then there  s the sad part that i believe is quite an overstatement to call it  depressing  . ratso rizzo is falling apart all throughout the movie  can barely walk  barely eat  coughs a lot  is sick  and reaches a head  point on the bus on its way to florida . he  s hurting badly  and only miles away from miami  he finally dies on the bus . the bus driver reassures everyone that nothing  s wrong  and continues on . sad  but not in the kind of way that  d make you go home and cry and mope around miserably as though you  ve just lost your dog of   years .  br    br   all in all  great movie . and the soundtrack pretty much consists just of  everybody  s talking   played all throughout the movie at appropriate times . an odd move  but a great one  as the song is good and fits in with the tone of the movie perfectly . go see it  it  s great  go buy it  ,1
one would think  as i did   that with steve martin  goldie hawn  and john cleese  a movie should be  at the very least  decent . these stars  especially martin and cleese  have produced some of the funniest works of comedy of all time .  br    br   well  apparently i was grossly mistaken   this is single  handedly one of the worst movies i have ever seen . it boggles my mind how one joke after the other can be so profoundly unfunny . it pained me to watch these talented actors execute one of the most positively lame scripts i have had the misfortune to come across . based solely on the big names  i remained hopeful for a long time through the duration of the film  but it consistently failed to provide any entertainment whatsoever .  br    br   normally  both with movies and in life  i try to stay away from biased comments and broad generalizations . but with this film  it  s hard not to let loose . i can count on one hand  perhaps even two or three fingers  major hollywood productions that left me more bitter than this . this is easily one of the worst comedies ever made .  br    br   i tried to enjoy this    i really did . but the out  of  towners ultimately fails miserably . if you really want time  efficient entertainment  just take your money and watch it swirl as you flush it down the toilet . just please don  t watch this movie .  ,0
cusack does his best david niven in this one  although i don  t know if anyone besides me noticed it .  br    br   when seen with this in mind  its a deliciously over saturated  wants to be taken more seriously than austin powers but still be pretty dmn funny  reworking of an under  appreciated comedy classic .  br    br   hillary duff does an over sexualized britney spears lap dance version of mata bond . the writers built a little reverse oedipus twist into the plot  interesting choice .  br    br   i never knew how soothing montel  s voice was until this movie . . . i think he has found a new calling doing nav system voice overs   ,1
personally  i think sayonara was the greatest movie he ever made . it touched every emotion from anger to romance to complete tragedy . and brando should have won for best actor . anyway  the movie is awesome  the man is attractive to both men and women and now you have no reason not to see it  do so  and fall in love .  ,1
the version i saw of this film was the blockbuster rental with a similar title  but a swear word in it .  br    br   this film was funny as hell . it was also true to the bone . if you have ever spent time in hollywood or the area around it  you will understand the humor . if not  you may not  get it  at all .  br    br   the story of two people in the business struggling to make it until they finally reach a breaking point  it is a rare gem . it states it is a drama  but it is a drama as much as deer hunter is a comedy .  br    br   loren dean is wonderful  as always  as a supporting actor . jamie kennedy was able to hold his own well . his performance is especically impressive during the poodle scene . the only downside was carmen electra but we can  t have everything .  ,1
this movie surprised me in a good way . from the box i got the impression that it was an action thriller but it was too funny to be a thriller  even though it was somewhat exciting .  br    br   there  s a lot of nice one  liners and funny situations in this movie and james belushi was born to do bill manucci  he does a great job . the rest of the cast ain  t half  bad either and especially timothy dalton is a treat .  br    br   the story can get pretty confusing at times as new characters shows up during the film . things get more complicated as nobody seldom tells the truth about things . if you don  t pay attention things might get a bit messy in the end but i really liked it .  br    br   louis morneau isn  t all that well known but he has done a perfectly ok job with this one and i never really grew impatient while watching the movie .  br    br   made men is well worth checking out .  ,1
thats my bush is first of all a very entertaining show by parker and stone  i thought . its often very very funny  and its quite subversive and crazy . south park fans would surely get something here .  br    br   another surprise is the production value here . a lot of money must have been put into this  and it shows . a lot of expensive little details . its not a little show . and comedy central is not an extremely rich channel  but they put a lot into this show obviously . in a way i understand that was the death of the show as well though  too costy . it surely could have been done cheaper and went on the will was there .  br    br   the critics liked it  and it had its little fanbase  but it failed gaining a big audience . as we know  the show stopped after  episodes  which i guess is almost  season .  br    br   as i really liked the show it has its faults . the problem of the show is kind of that it doesn  t know what it wants to be really . its like it tries to be a sitcom and a parody of a sitcom at the same time . the actors do a good job  and some of them are well casted  but in my opinion they seem to not always get     the bizarre humor they  re supposed to present .  br    br   i personally think that the show needed some characters that were more down to earth for the show to work . in south park you have kyle and stan  that are kind of a realistic touch in the more looney universe . i think thats kind of what makes south park work . you need some sane characters that you can relate to in a realistic way  and that makes the insane stuff so much more interesting too because that forces you to take them seriously at some level . if everything is archetypes and stereotypes its difficult to get emotionally included in the show  which really is thats my bush biggest problem . kyle and stan is characters in south park that makes sense of the insanity in the show . we have nothing like that here  and this show suffers from it .  br    br   another anchorpoint is parker and stones flirting with republicans . its the only thing about them i don  t really get what they  re trying to do . not portraying bush as nothing else than a dumb homer simpsons lovable kind of character is kind of subversive in a world where a lot of people that can  t stand him and think he  s the worst president since nixon  and a parallel comedy world of letterman and so on that only satirizes his every move . . . but its difficult to understand if parker and stone actually means anything by it . its like the joke is on us  but somehow it doesn  t hit the mark . it seems awkward  because it doesn  t remind you of the real bush at all .  br    br   besides that i actually thought the show was very enjoyable . some of the jokes in here are hilarious . the pro  life supporter who was a surviving aborted fetus is probably one of my favorite jokes by them in any show . and the show is packed with great material  and is sometimes insanely funny if you use your head a little while watching it .  ,1
and i repeat  please do not see this movie  this is more than a review . this is a warning . this sets the record for the worst  most effortless comedy ever made . at least with most of the recent comedies nowadays  the gags are crude and flat  but the writers and directors put in at least some sort of effort into making them funny . i never get tired of repeating one of my favorite mottos everyone thinks they can do comedy  and only   percent of them are right . comedy is hard  this is not some genre any fool can play around with . i think it  s atrocious that the filmmakers are comparing this piece of garbage to  kentucky fried movie .  basically  these bozos are comparing their so  called comic talents to those of the brilliant jim abrahams and the zucker brothers . come on  i  ve seen pauly shore movies that are   times funnier than  the underground comedy movie .  here  s a sample of the comedy for those curious about seeing this movie one sketch involves a superhero dressed like a penis named dkman . the whole joke is that he defeats his enemies by squirting them with semen . that  s it . that  s the whole joke . wow . this is enough to make carrot top roll his eyes . another sketch involves a man having sex with a dead person in a porn movie . and in another sketch  there  s a bag lady beauty contest  in which we  re exposed to the horrible sights of bikini  clad middle  aged women with beer guts and stretch marks . plus  making fun of the homeless is more sad than funny . it  s a step away from mocking the mentally handicapped . the whole movie is supposed to be a satire . i think the filmmakers forgot that a key element of satire . . . is truth    for anybody who actually enjoyed this crap  explain to me what is truthful about any of these gags  some of the sketches might  ve sounded funny on paper  but anybody who  s taken any screen writing classes knows that if a sight gag sounds too funny on paper  it probably won  t be funny on screen . if i tell someone about a big  black  muscular gay virgin  who  s saving himself for the right man  he or she would probably laugh . but watching the premise played out on screen for about   minutes is a complete drag . i hate how whenever people criticize a low  brow comedy like this for not being funny  they  re regarded as stuck  up squares . i just saw  white chicks  recently . that  s another low  brow  politically incorrect comedy  but i laughed my head off . the most offensive thing about  the underground comedy movie  is it  s not funny  what the writers and directors don  t understand is that merely being filthy and tasteless doesn  t work . there has to be more  just think of the famous scene from  there  s something about mary   ironically  enough the bozo filmmakers put the farrellys on their special thanks list  . the joke about the semen wasn  t just funny because it involved bodily fluids . there was a buildup . ben stiller was masturbating in the bathroom to make sure he didn  t go out on a date with a  loaded gun .  then he looked around to see where all the semen went after it was released . a knock is on the door  and he has to answer it . his date  mary  is at the door and that  s when it  s revealed that the semen is hanging off ben  s ear . in this movie  there are multiple gags involving characters squirting loads of semen at people  with no buildup whatsoever . as jay leno always says   this comedy thing  s not so easy  is it   keep that in mind  vince offer   cause you weren  t cut out for this genre   the only reason people might laugh at these gags is because they want to feel hip . let  s face it  nowadays it  s hip to laugh at anything politically incorrect . i know comedy is subjective . . . but this movie shouldn  t be funny to anybody  except maybe the filmmakers themselves . as a side note  the movie had to have been made before michael clarke duncan  s fame in movies like  armageddon  and  the green mile .  there can  t be any other reason why an actor of his caliber would volunteer to be part of this amateurish freak show . all the others in the cast are either non  actors  has  been actors or b  movie stars . karen black made a good impression in  five easy pieces   but i don  t think she  s done anything of value ever since . slash was probably drugged into being in this film . gina lee nolin is nothing without  baywatch .  angelyne is the film  s biggest star  keeping in mind duncan wasn  t famous at the time   and there are still probably a ton of people who haven  t heard of her   for good reason . usually  i  m in support of extremely low  budget flicks  but this one deserves to drift into obscurity . i hope to lord this doesn  t become a cult classic  shouldn  t there be a law against distributing crap like this   ,0
i am totally addicted to this show . i can  t wait till the week goes by to see the next showing . it  s a great story line and it has the best actors and actresses on the show . i will tune in every week to watch it even if i am not home i always have my vcr set to tape monarch cove . simon rex is the best actor on the show . it is suspenseful and exciting . i think this show should stay on the air and i believe everyone should tune in to watch it . i saw the very first episode and actually i wasn  t going to watch it but i was watching lifetime one day and i decided to watch it because it was on and i absolutely love it and right now it  s my favorite show . i am really mean it .  ,1
many moons ago when i was seven years old  i can vaguely remember seeing a trailer for this movie . it appealed to my naive sense of curiosity and i decided to ask my parents to take me to this movie . being the wise adults that they are  they told me  absolutely not  it  s a bunch of trash .  of course  i was very disappointed that i would not be the first kid on my block to see the  incredible melting man .   br    br   little time passed  maybe a couple of days . i forgot about  the incredible melting man  and my disappointment faded . twenty  five years passed until it re  entered the forefront of my thoughts . while surfing through channels on digital cable  i found this long  lost relic of a movie . my curiosity was piqued and i decided to finally partake in this fruit forbidden by my parents . i should have listened to them . the  incredible melting man  is perhaps the worst movie known to man . it makes movies such as  def  con    metalstorm   and  freddie got fingered  look like oscar nominees . i feel violated for wasting almost two hours of my life watching this vile filth . the story was incoherent and the effects were crude even for     . how anyone convinced a film company to produce this movie beyond me .  br    br   don  t make the same mistake that i did . listen to your parents if they forbade you to watch this movie . they were right .  ,0
for a long time it seemed like all the good canadian actors had headed south of the border and  i guessed  all the second rank ones filled the top slots and that left the dregs for the sex comedies .  br    br   this film was a real surprise despite the outlandish plots that are typical of farces  the actors seemed to be trying to put something into their characters and what we  the viewer  got back was almost true suspension of belief . when the extras from the music video attacked the evicting police  you almost believed it was possible .  br    br   if you are a fan of some of the better sex farces  canadian or not  you should definitely seek this one out . and the big surprise  this sex farce is also loaded with some very good nudity .  ,1
well i gave this movie a  . it was better than  thirdspace  but not as good as  in the beginning  as far as the b  movies go . i really think the television series did a much better job overall with the special effects and character portrayal . let  s hope the producers and cast get the next series  crusade  up to the standards of b  .  ,1
i usually don  t write reviews but i can  t understand why this is rated so high and wanted to give a warning to horror lovers since i can only assume that all those high ratings were given by average tv watchers .  br    br   i have only watched the first two episodes but those two were so clich  it wasn  t even funny any more . the same old stories you  ve probably seen  read a couple of times already  living toys  evil things from other dimensions . . . and it  s not just that these stories aren  t innovative  they are also pretty bad versions of those clichs . i  d prefer e . g .  chucky  and  silent hill  over those two episodes anytime . and don  t even ask about the visual effects . . . the ones in the first episode are alright but the ones in the second . . . awful . looks like some film student  s project gone wrong . blood . . . or gore . . . erm . . . nothing worth mentioning .  br    br   it might be interesting for some ten year old kid who probably hasn  t seen  read that many scary stories yet  although i  d rather recommend  beyond belief   now that  s what i call a decent mystery tv show  . but for an adult horror fan this is worthless . i only gave the  points because there is in fact some beautiful cinematography  especially in the second episode  and some nice acting .  ,0
the human tornado is a campy    s blaxploitation movie starring nightclub comedian rudy ray moore in perhaps his most endearing role to date . the movie tells the tale of dolemite  a bad ass pimpin  hustler who gets on the wrong side of a white  racist sheriff by sleeping with his wife . dolemite barely escapes  and journeys to sunny california to visit an old friend  a nightclub owner  and madam to dolemite  s  ladies   named queen bee . however  it seems that a rival nightclub owner with mob connections is trying to muscle in on her racket  so dolemite takes matters into his own hands . rudy ray moore showcases many diverse talents in this landmark film  including strong dramatic skills  a mastery of kung fu  an impressive singing voice  he provides two of the songs on the soundtrack   a touching  compassionate side with the ladies  and an overall compelling charisma and keen sense of comic timing . this film has it all  people a deep plot  blistering action  laugh  a  minute comedy  beautiful women in distress  a slam  bang ending . . . what more could you ask from a movie  run  don  t walk  to your local video store and rent the human tornado today . and be sure to share it with your family .  ,1
while being an impressionable youth when first experiencing the gundam wing series  upon re  watching the series  i have reconfirmed my belief that this series is not only beautifully animated  but the plot  the gundam design  character design  and character depth are masterfully executed . while at first appearing like a boy band of sorts  the stylish attractiveness of the characters can partly be credited to just great art  with individual personalities creating clear and endearing distinctions among the characters . consequently  it is extremely easy to become to drawn to any particular character . personally  i liked heero because of his stoic personality . while i may be biased with a sentimental attachment of this show to my childhood  i can objectively say that gundam wing addresses the deeper questions of war and life in general  how can we obtain peace   while providing action packed battles in large robot suits  which  to say the least  is excellent .  ,1
madhur bhandarkar goes all out to touch upon taboo issues and gives the most realistic picture of the modern society . one gets the impression of the director even from his earlier movies like satta and chandni bar . the issues just hinted on in the latter movie are explored and exposed in totality here . the casting is amazing and one can see the judgements on each scene from many angles . mostly  the movie leaves you wondering on lots of facts around . as you start guessing the things  you end up at most being close  but missing the mark in many a scenes . it leaves a lasting impression in the end .  br    br   actors to watch are konkana sen sharma  boman irani  atul kulkarni among others . the dialogues are well written and you feel you  ve lived around some of these people . there are still some scenes that make you think of more depths . the songs are in the background saving time and lata  s voice in a very meaningful song  kitne ajeeb  leaves you feeling you  re left all alone in the midst of the modern society   ,1
  serum  starts out with credits that are quite reminiscent of the  re  animator  movies  and it owes a lot to them . the story is very similar a mad doctor develops a serum that he believes will alleviate pain  sickness and death  but he  s apparently not a big believer in clinical trials and so winds up with a brain  eating zombie on his hands in the person of his nephew . the zombie even looks like one of those from  re  animator   and in fact some of the make  up effects in  serum  aren  t bad . unfortunately  the script is pretty slow and unbelievable in quite a few places  resulting in a soap opera feel for most of the first    of the movie . for some reason  the director feels compelled to tell us the time of day every few minutes by flashing it in big white letters across the screen . i can  t see why this was important  other than being an attempt to provide viewers with a sense of time passing sometimes  that wouldn  t be present otherwise as the plot plods along .  br    br   there are a number of moments that just don  t add up here . for instance  one victim is bludgeoned with a sledge hammer  but when we see the victim  s head up close  there  s no sign of that trauma . in another scene  a character runs down a fully lit hospital corridor  we can see the circles of light on the floor  in fact  with a flashlight in hand  looking for all the world like he  s walking in the dark . . . but a moment later a second character walks down the same fully  lit corridor without one . these are just a couple of examples moments of what look like directorial or editorial sloppiness crop up quite frequently throughout the movie .  br    br    serum  is better in some ways than much of what goes straight  to  video as independent horror lately . in terms of technical items  sound and photography  for example  it  s got a more polished look than a lot of what lands on a dvd . on the other hand  there  s still a good deal of wooden acting  particularly by one of the lead characters  the mad scientist himself   and nonsensical moments that have nothing to do with suspension of disbelief and everything to do with writing and continuity . maybe these are things that the people involved with making this film will eventually get more experience with  though . one of the problems with low  budget independent horror lately is that the filmmakers often set out to remake more popular movies that had bigger budgets  and that almost never works out . it didn  t in the case of  serum   anyhow .  ,0
peter sollett has created an endearing portrait about real people living in poverty in the lower east side of new york  or loisaida  as it  s known by the locals .  br    br   mr . sollett  s heart is in the right place as he examines this dysfunctional family  that is typical of the different  inner cities  of the country . mr . sollett accentuates the positive in the story he presents . these are basically good kids  the children of parents that have left them and whose grandmother has taken under her wing .  br    br   instead of presenting his characters as losers  mr . sollett shows a positive side they all have . these kids are not into drugs  or are stealing because they are poor . had this story been done by hollywood we would have seen a parade of stereotypes  instead of children that are struggling  but deep down inside  they are not defeated .  br    br   victor rasuk  as victor vargas  was a revelation . he is a natural . so is july marte . her character shows us a no nonsense girl who will not be fooled or driven to do anything she doesn  t want to do . altagracia guzman  as the grandmother is excellent . she conveys her frustration at not being able to steer her grandchildren into the things she believes in and that are so important to her .  br    br   all in all  this was an excellent picture thanks to peter sollett .  ,1
robert urich was a fine actor  and he makes this tv movie believable . i remember watching this film when i was    and when seeing it a second time my opinion stays the same . people lose who they were when enter this exclusive club  in a computer rich californian town . urich try  s to figure out what is wrong with his family  and i love the halloween space suit idea  brilliant . this film is about the battle of one  s sprit . tv quality  that exceeds  the big budget  gangs of new york . i wonder if robert urich was the compassionate man he portrayed in many of his movie  i hope so   or  out of   .  ,1
a film as bad as this should be withdrawn from all stores world wide . so full of boring  dull  unimaginative characters  and with a lead character with such an annoying attitude and dry voice constantly giving a thoughtless voice over for every action and feeling  this film holds the record for the most challenging film i have ever watched . as i had payed money to own it  i felt a duty to see it through  and how i regret it . my head hurt throughout because of the terribly dull characters and their pointless  plot less lives . a bunch of kids who have zero knowledge about anything  are all frigid and worst of all  have terrible dialogue throughout  just mulling around as the main character tries to get a date with the girl . boring  so much so my friend was shaking with hatred and i was red with embarrassment that i  d thrown away   . the dvd was on ebay the following day  and i didn  t make much of my money back . avoid like the plague .  ,0
i awake suddenly  aware that i  m drooling onto the plastic couch cover  and realize it  s a warm saturday afternoon . why was i sleeping  did i hit my head  or accidentally swallow all of my grandma  s muscle relaxers  could it be adult onset narcolepsy   br    br   no  i momentarily paused on cheap seats while channel surfing  and the stunning lack of humor and talent drained my life force with such speed that i blacked out .  br    br   it  s that head  shaking  mouth  agape  shoulder  shrugging bad . but i have to give these moronic and boring twins credit for selling this idea through . perhaps they had the same effect on the espn programming executive that they had on me  and when he  she woke up  a few horrendous episodes were already in the can and he  she hoped that since all the viewers will be asleep  no one will now how awful it is and he  she can keep the         annual salary .  br    br   you  ve been warned .  ,0
despite the other comments listed here  this is probably the best dirty harry movie made a film that reflects   for better or worse   the country  s socio  political feelings during the reagan glory years of the early     s . it  s also a kickass action movie .  br    br   opening with a liberal  female judge overturning a murder case due to lack of tangible evidence and then going straight into the coffee shop encounter with several unfortunate hoodlums  the scene which prompts the famous   go ahead  make my day  line    sudden impact  is one non  stop roller coaster of an action film . the first time you get to catch your breath is when the troublesome inspector callahan is sent away to a nearby city to investigate the background of a murdered hood . it gets only better from there with an over  the  top group of grotesque thugs for callahan to deal with along with a sherriff with a mysterious past . superb direction and photography and a at  times hilarious script help make this film one of the best of the     s .  ,1
it should first be said that i have read the manga and therefore my argument is based on the differences .  br    br   this anime greatly disappointed me because it removed the comedy and high quality action of the manga and ova . what it left behind was merely a husk of what it could have been . many of the characters lacked the depth that is seen in the manga . alucard is not the sympathetic character that secretly wishes for death . walter  s story lacks the betrayal . and the nazi villains that plot to engulf the world in war are completely absent . instead  the anime provides the gary stu villain incognito who is defeated against what appear to be all odds .  br    br   my primary complaint is not that the anime diverges from the manga  but that it does such a poor job .  ,0
come on    they did that on purpose   two of my current faves on tv  meloni from  oz  and  l and o  svu  and janel from  west wing   hook up for a nice little sleeper  character study . plot  s nothing fancy  but the acting is right on the mark . tim busfield shows up for some neat bits . worth a look .  ,1
i went into this movie with high hopes . normally  i  m not too picky about my movies and creature movies are always fun to watch  or so i thought . i  ll list the good parts of this movie  the creature effects . all of the creatures were well  done  their movements were realistic  and they fit into the other imagery well . to be honest  the creature effects were the only reason i gave this movie a  rather than a  . now  the bad things  the acting . good lord  i  ve seen bad acting  but this movie takes the cake . not a single one of the characters is even close to believable . it  s like the director sent out a casting call and picked all the worst try  outs from it . i tried very hard not to giggle too loud  cause i didn  t wanna upset anyone else in the theatre  but the acting really was that bad .  the storyline the entire story is full of plot holes from beginning to finish . you can pick at least  plot holes out of any given   minutes of film . the plot holes  of course  are complimentary with the cheese . this is probably one of the most clichd  not thought  out  and outright dumbest stories i  ve ever seen put on screen since i had the grave misfortune of sitting up one night and watching parasite on the scifi channel .  the dialogue this is a world where everyone says the cheesiest and most clichd thing they possibly can  at every chance they possibly can . in this world  it seems like every line has been spoken before in at least   other low  budget creature movies . it is the world of cheese and clich .  the special effects . while the creature effects were downright awesome  the special effects fail miserably . yes  they are better than those seen in other movies  but a lot of it is in the presentation . and this movie has no presentation whatsoever . it looks kinda like the special effects used on the power rangers tv show  to be honest . to sum up dragon wars is worth neither your time nor your money . the concept is good  but it is trapped in the bad directing  acting  dialogue  and cheesiness of the film . wait til the next big monster movie comes out . it  s gotta be better than this  cause dragon wars is absolutely horrible .  ,0
i got to see this on the plane to nz last week  and was wondering how it would measure up to both the uk film and the book . i have to say i was favorable impressed . if anything the fanatical attachment to the red sox during the lean years works even better than the original devotion to arsenal fc  who have had success through the years . as a brit i was also interested to see that you don  t need to understand baseball to get what  s going on . one question springs to mind  was the screenplay written using the sox as the team even before they finally broke the curse of the bambino  or was another team in the frame  as a red sox fan myself  weird i know  a brit who understands baseball  i have to say that it added to the enjoyment .  ,1
this movie is so great . its set back in probably the    s and meg ryan  s character struggles to be known as  smart .  plus tim robbins is so cute in this movie . and everything about it has a magical feeling towards it . everytime i watch it i feel happy . it  s definitely a girl movie  and i  m a girl  so i like it . i also love the music . the violin is awesome . but besides that i think it  s a cute story and everyone should watch it .  ,1
robert mitchum stars as clint tollinger in this short but tough western man with the gun . tollinger is a professional town tamer  as in  when a town needs someone to save itself he is the one who is brought in to do it . tollinger  s latest gig comes by as an accident strolling into town looking for his former fling  he stumbles into a town being played like a puppet by a local western gangster . but many townspeople begin to rue the day they hired tollinger  as his way of cleaning up the town becomes very taxing  suddenly high plains drifter seems less original  .  br    br   man with the gun starts off as an average western tough  guy film but begins to surprise you more and more as the film progresses . what starts off as forgettable and run  of  the  mill ends up dark and character  centered . the entire film is very well shot and the cast is very enjoyable . mitchum is his usual excellent self here in man with the gun  not one of his very best performances  mitchum still has his classic and effective tough  guy screen presence in high gear and he knocks the action  packed  meaningful  and shocking scenes of the film right out of the park . man with the gun is a nice mitchum western and is easily worth one  s time .  ,1
don  t be fooled by the silly title folks  this is one sweet ride  a true successor to tetsuo the iron man and ichi the killer  this gem starts with a bang and lays the gore on thick until the credits roll . it seems that aliens are taking over people  s bodies and modifying them into war  machines  which are then used to fight each other in a twisted game for the amusement of their species . the winner of the battle eats the loser alive . that  s mostly it for plot  but who cares when the gore is this good  i have no idea how many buckets of slime were used  but it  s disgusting to behold . there is interesting and effective use of stop  motion when the takeovers are in progress  and loving care is lavished on all of the creature and make  up effects . the cgi is a bit limited  but that actually doesn  t detract from the overall quality one bit  at least for me . this was truly a fun and stomach  turning film that deserves much praise  and has truly earned its place in the stack of cult classics . find it and watch  you won  t be disappointed   ,1
reading the various external reviews of roger ebert and other well  known film critics makes me hesitate to admit how much i love this movie  even though i only have a dubbed  into  japanese video version of it .  br    br   apparently  many critics seem to take it as a minus that the story premise has been used before  most famously in the very great  it  s a wonderful life .  to me  a great premise is a great premise no matter how many times it  s used  and i  d be happy to see more movies using this particular premise   the discontented man who gets a chance to gain a fresh perspective on his own life through a bit of  divine magic .   br    br   i suppose folks and critics of a more intellectual bent are not as pulled into the story  but i don  t go to movies to critique them with notebook in hand   i go to movies to throw myself into them and let them take me where they will .  br    br   if you are sentimental sort like myself  you  ll be well rewarded by seeing this picture . the performances are excellent throughout  and the movie was very well cast . wonderful choice of music  too . michael caine is superb as the sympathetic bartender . jim belushi does a great job as an  average joe  kind of guy who wonders if his life hasn  t gone as it should . linda hamilton  always excellent  is again right on target here as the loving wife . jon lovitz entertains as usual  and even has some surprisingly moving moments in  mr . destiny .   br    br   no   mr . destiny  is not  it  s a wonderful life   but who says it has to be  taken on its own terms   mr . destiny  is an enjoyable  well  made  funny  and moving film . i  ve seen my japanese  dubbed video of it numerous times  and i  m sure i  ll see it several more times . if that somehow makes me a  lowbrow   so be it  i  m just glad that i hadn  t read any reviews of  mr . destiny  before seeing it .  br    br   i suppose i should have the courage of my convictions and give the movie nine or ten stars  but i couldn  t help but doubt myself after reading all the critical reviews   ,1
it seems the makers of this film had trouble deciding what their message really was . consequently  they had even more trouble delivering it . they began by poorly describing principles of quantum physics which relate to sub  atomic particles . having established a fuzzy picture of heisenberg  s uncertainty principle  they presented a barrage of talking heads who built a case of ridiculous logic intimating that every living person is an entity which follows the same quantum rules on a cosmic scale . then there was a lot of talk about ideas upon which stephen covey and tony robbins have made their careers positive thinking  interrupting bad patterns  always look on the bright side  etc . next came a bit about how our brains can change our bodies through production of proteins hormones which we more or less choose to create . if you are sad  you will create sad proteins . if you are happy  you will create happy proteins . it  s just so simple  isn  t it  interwoven with our lessons we follow the fictitious life of amanda  a photographer who pops anti  depressants and hates her thighs . the film makers slowly but surely were trying to get us all to say   hey  amanda  just cheer up   why can  t she cheer up  obviously it  s because the world is a bad place where there is crime and poverty and religion  that  s why . the conclusion of the film  which is basically the entire second half  brought on a barrage of contradiction . we are all a part of a whole energy where we are not beings  but a collective consciousness  but we are individuals who can change the world  but there are many of each of us because of all the different dimensions  but we can choose who we are  and we have a purpose to do good  but there is no god because there is nothing better than us  so there is no such thing as right and wrong  so there is no such thing as reward or punishment  so nothing good ever came out of religion  but we should still do good anyway  even though there is no such thing as bad and good because there is nobody to decide what that is  except for the fact that we each can make life good if we all meditate  and then crime will cease  and if we say nice things  our water will freeze into pretty shapes . still with me  good because there is more . according to robert l . park in his book  voodoo science   the whole meditation experiment put on by john hagelin in washington  d . c . was a farce  the numbers were doctored  and the murder rate was higher that year that any year before or since . and what about your positive attitude keeping you young and healthy  this was a message delivered by an older man who looked his age and a woman who was overweight .  br    br   so does all this work or not  i was lucky enough to see the film at a theater where betsy chasse  one of the film  s three directors  yes  three  fielded questions following the show . i call myself lucky because i had first  hand confirmation that these people don  t know what they are talking about . several of the questions asked by audience members had her so stumped that her husband  a chiropractor  had to step in and recite the answer . i finally had to leave when the discussion inevitably turned political  and everyone  including ms . chasse  began speculating as to how wonderful the world would be if only president bush could see this movie .  ,0
this is a romantic comedy where albert einstein  played wonderfully by walter matthau  and his cronies play match maker to his niece  meg ryan  and a talented auto mechanic  tim robbins  . the interplay among these major roles is augmented by a terrific supporting cast of well recognized character actors . this movie is cute and fun . . . a  feel  gooder   hearty recommendations .  ,1
a friend of mine was in the cast as a feds agent  a non  speaking part  as i recall  . he brought it over on dvd so i could see it . it was  interesting   but very much felt like an amateur film . a well made amateur film  though . really boring and poorly written . it was probably fun to make and be involved in  but it definitely didn  t deserve any kind of wide release . maybe in omaha they  d enjoy it  but this california girl was bored and honestly kind of embarrassed for my friend  s involvement .  br    br   if this film maker has made or makes any more films  he really should try to have a really interesting story line  and good actors . i  m sure this was a great learning tool for them . i wish them luck in the future  and hope they can improve their film making .  ,0
h . g . wells in     was past his prime and the books of his that will survive were long gone by . he was coming to the end of his life and he was confronted to his dream gone sour . at the very beginning of the   th century he defended the idea that the world was doomed because the evolution of species  natural biology  on one side  and marxism  market economy on the other side  were necessarily leading to the victory of the weaker over the stronger due to the simple criterion of number . the weaker were the mass of humanity and the stronger were the minority elite . he defended then a strict eugenic policy with the elimination of all those who were in a way or another weakening the human race . first of all the non  caucasian  with the only exception of the jews who would disappear thanks to mixed marriages . then  within the caucasian community all those who were not healthy  the alcoholics  the mentally disabled  all those who were genetically disabled  etc . that was not hitler . that was h . g . wells and that was not after the first world war . that was more than ten years before . and twenty years before the first world war he had published the time machine that defended the idea that the human  race   left to its own means and due to the vaster cosmological evolution of life on earth  would see the differentiation of the human  race  into two  species   the working class would become a subterranean laborious species and the bourgeoisie would become an idle surface species . the point was in the novel that the surface sophisticated and weak idle species was the prey of the other species who were the predators . wells was convinced humanity was in danger and politicians were supposed to stop this evolution by imposing a strict eugenic policy . the first countries to follow this injunction were the scandinavian countries who were also the last to drop it only very recently for some of them . the film here proposes a vision of     with a world government that is absolutely dictatorial in the fact that there is no election  no parliament  no really democratic institution  only peace imposed by military conquest  and the government is dominated by one man or at the most one man and his few councilors . and in that future world all  absolutely all human beings are caucasians . wells was able to imagine humanity being completely white by     . amazing . wells envisaged some kind of a rebellion but that would be short lived and lead to nothing at all . the last sentences are the vision of this white civilization conquering the whole universe when contemplating the sky and its stars and planets . frightening . and that was produced in     . all the more frightening since nowhere the slightest mention of hitlerism  fascism  japanese imperialism or stalinism can be found . but it is essential to have that film in a good restored edition because it is crucial to have a full vision of h . g . wells . we are obviously very far away from the brave new world of absolute  democratic  social selection  or the animal farm of the dictatorship of the porcine proletariat  or the     of the abstract mediatic dictatorship of big brother . this vision is at least just as much frightening as the three others . and i only want to compare wells with the british science fiction writers of his days . it would be unfair to go beyond . this reveals that in england in these first three decades of the   th century there was a tremendous fear among intellectuals the fear that the future would only be somber  bleak and in the form of an impasse of some kind .  br    br   dr jacques coulardeau  university paris dauphine  university paris  pantheon sorbonne  university versailles saint quentin en yvelines  ,1

take a pinch of goodfellas  mix it with the godfather  add some roman mythology and plenty of lowbrow comedy  and you have the sopranos  about a mob clan operating out of northern new jersey . it  s almost as entertaining as pro wrestling . i am not the biggest fan of this show  but i do admire james gandolfini  s very complicated tony soprano  a psychopath with an occasional glimmer of conscience . i also have come to admire te contributions of folks like gravel  voiced dom chianese as the bewildered but murderous uncle junior  silver  haired tony sirico as the perpetually perplexed paulie and the very beautiful edie falco as the duplicitous  tough  as  nails carmela soprano . the violence is sudden and graphic  the body count steadily climbs each season  but it is often the small moments that matter most here . watch paulie and tony  s nephew christopher  michael imperioli late of law  order  as they get lost in the pine barrens and sit out a bitter cold night in an abandoned trruck  both convinced they  ve had it .  ,1
this is one of my favorites along with the mariette hartley and robert lansing  sandy  and the agnes moorhead  and  the  tiny  spacemen episodes .  br    br   it is an important take  from mid       on the long cold war that the u . s . was then embroiled in . the beaten  down city  scene  the near  starving characters  sparse dialog  their threadbare uniforms  and the minimal action  says  it all the absurdity of an on  going conflict that threatens to destroy human life  modern civilization  and all that is sweet and redeeming about it .  br    br   it is a  fable  because it was made in a time in which  had events turned out differently  such as the second berlin crisis  spring      and the subsequent cuban missile crisis  oct .       it would have actually been a reasonable representation of one of the u . s .  s major cities  ruined and replete with a few miserable survivors . i also see it as a  fable  because it is not only a cautionary tale  but because it is the most redemptive of all our popular myths it is a love story  set in an impossible situation  and involving two highly mismatched lovers .  ,1
what the hell is in your minds  this film sucks  each minute i was getting more and more bored . i strove to watch the end because i hope something at least would at last happen  but instead of that  i got amazed how dull the end was treated . . . what is this story about this bloody  bogeyman   how comes he doesn  t die  he is a bloody human being for god  s sake  a mere boy that killed his silly sister   years ago . then what  his stay on a psychiatric hospital made him immortal  this film a fascinatingly stupid . . . it  s a must of silliness . i  m gonna resell it right now to some silly guy who will understand this silly film .  ,0
the sunshine boys is a terrific comedy about two ex  vaudevillians who reluctantly reunite for a tv special despite the fact that they despise each other .  br    br   the comic genius of two masters at work  george burns and walter matthau are stellar  some of the best scenes are when the duo is fighting over the silliest little trivial things  the material is fast  paced and witty  appealing to all ages .  br    br   mild spoiler alert there are some mildly sad moments toward the end of the movie that deal indirectly with the affects of aging that gives the film a soft  sincere  tenderness that shows to this reviewer that what the pair really need the most for success  are each other .  br    br   if anyone loves the odd couple  you  ll adore this movie . an excellent film   ,1
as the one  line summary says  two movies have left such a remark on me when i walked out of the theater . the one was  stir of echoes  with kevin bacon  and the second was  vanilla sky  .  br    br   its one of those movies that you sit deep in the theater seat and stop thinking about anyone around you  stop wondering what the end of the movie will be and just leave the movie swift you where it wants . . . walking out of the cinema was a bit weird  like that feeling you get when you are sick and cant think of anything . one of those movies that you become one with the guy  and feel that nothing else moves around you than the things in the movie .  br    br   one thing is certain . the actors are awesome  the sound track is excellent  and everything in the movie is   .  br    br   surely one of the best movies i ever saw  and the movie that made the best and most shocking awaking about my life and my purpose in this world .  ,1
i honestly had no idea that the notorious b . i . g .  bert i . gordon the director not the murdered rapper  was still active in the    s  i always presumed the deliciously inept  empire of the ants  stood as his last masterful accomplishment in the horror genre  but that was before my dirty little hands stumbled upon an ancient and dusty vhs copy of  the coming   a totally obscure and unheard of witchery  movie that actually turned out a more or less pleasant surprise  what starts out as a seemingly atmospheric tale of late dark ages soon takes a silly turn when a villager of year     inexplicably becomes transferred to present day salum  massachusetts and promptly attacks a girl in the history museum . for you see  this particular girl is the reincarnation of ann putman who was a bona fide evil girl in     and falsely accused over twenty people of practicing witchcraft which led to their executions at the state . the man who attacked loreen lost his wife and daughter this and wants his overdue revenge . but poor and three centuries older loreen is just an innocent schoolgirl   or is she   burned at the stake  unfolds like a mixture between  the exorcist  and  witchfinder general  with a tad bit of  the time machine  thrown in for good measure . way to go  bert  the plot becomes sillier and more senseless with every new twist but at least it never transcends into complete boredom  like too often the case in other contemporary witchcraft movies like  the dunwich horror  and  the devonsville terror  . the film jumps back and forth between the events in present day and flashbacks of      which keeps it rather amusing and fast  paced . the ann putman girl is quite a fascinating character  reminiscent of the abigail williams character in the more commonly known stage play  the crucible   also depicted by winona ryder in the     motion picture  . there are a couple of cool death sequences  like the teacher in the graveyard or the journalist in the library  that are committed by the ghost of malignant reverend who made a pact with ann putman and perhaps even the devil himself . the film gets pretty spastic and completely absurd near the end  but overall there  s some good cheesy fun to be had . plus  the least you can say about bert i . gordon is that he definitely build up some directorial competences over the years .  ,0
allison dean  s performance is what stands out in my mind watching this film . she balances out the melancholy tone of the film with an iridescent energy . i would like to see more of her .  ,1

with lots of sunshine  gauzy light and shadow filtering through windows and into rooms  tracking shots moving through crowds with hand  held camera  quick  paced editing and extreme close  ups here and there  the photography is the thing in this interesting  artistically done film .  br    br   the plot of this film starts out as a bit of fluff about a beauty contest . the film begins on a warm sunday at the local swimming pool  where we meet the lovely lucienne aka lulu  played by louise brooks   a bit of a show  off in front of the gawking men by poolside  she soon decides to enter herself to represent france in the miss europe beauty contest  much to the chagrin of her very jealous  stick  in  the  mud fianc  a pretty annoying fellow  really  . strutting down the runway the ten contestants display themselves in swimsuits  while the winner is chosen as the contestant who receives the longest applause  i was wondering  couldn  t the girls just walk slower to prolong their length of time  and thus applause  on the catwalk    . lulu is soon being chased by a prince and a maharaja  but her hot  headed beau doesn  t like the attentions paid to her by other men or her adoring public  for that matter  i guess he just wants her in his house  cooking his meals  and staying out of sight  eh    .  br    br   louise brooks is beautiful and charming  her presence helps enhance this film  but it  s really the way it is photographed that held my interest the most . a bit distracting is the odd dubbed sound  which is a bit off . the print on this version looked very clear and full of nice contrast though . watching this i just tried to overlook the sound problems and watch the film visually  and i found the movie to be excellent  well worth seeing .  ,1
this movie is one exception of the rule that a sequel is worser than the original . its comedy at its best . this movie is a fast action slapstick comedy where something seems to happened every second . at more than one occasion the entire audience laughed loudly at a joke .  br    br   its a big advantage to have seen the first movie but its not a requirement .  br    br   gta kanal  also have the advantage of being a parody on the latest decades reality production tv series such as survivor  expediton robinson in swedish  this is a swedish movie for the swedish audience . thus don  t see it if you aren  t familiar with sweden and its language . otherwise have fun  johan  ,1
  slaughter high  is a totally ridiculous slasher flick about a high school nerd marty  who gets pick on all the time by some pranksters . the prank goes wrong and he ends up getting savagely burned . five years later his tormentors all attend a reunion  just the ten of them of course  and low and behold marty murders them one after another . british actress caroline munro   maniac   leads the cast as the heroine  who dies anyway   . the acting is completely awful  there  s also no suspense at all . plenty of grotesque death scenes to satisfy the gore  freaksa guy  s stomach explodes  another female victim literally gets an acid bath  a couple having sex in bed get electrocuted  a guy is crushed by a tractor  one girl is drowned  and a doctor gets a hyperdermic needle in the eye . the killer wears a decent and rather creepy jester  s mask and the setting  a beautiful old english castle  is really nice . however the dream finale is utterly pathetic . all in all it  s true that  slaughter high  is a piece of garbage  but i enjoyed it . only for fans of truly bad slasher flicks .  ,1

master cinaste alain resnais likes to work with those actors who are a part of his family . in this film too we see resnais  family members like pierre arditi  sabine azema  andr dussolier and fanny ardant dealing with serious themes like death  religion  suicide  love and their overall implications on our daily lives . the formal nature of relationship shared by these people is evident as even friends  they address each other using a formal you . in      while making l  amour  mort  resnais dealt with time  memory and space to unravel the mysteries of a fundamental question of human existence is love stronger than death  it was   years ago in     that resnais made a somewhat similar film je t  aime je t  aime which was also about love and memories . message of this film is loud and clear true and deep love can even put science to shame as dead lovers regain their lost lives leaving doctors to care for their reputation . l  amour  mort is like a game which is not at all didactic . it is a film in which the musical score is in perfect tandem with its images . this is one of the reasons why this film can easily be grasped .  ,1
man to man tries hard to be a good movie it has its heart at the right place  it aspires to be epic and it has a message that no doubt everybody will appreciate . but there lies also some of the problems of this picture . it strives so hard to be good and to get its message across that sometimes the viewer must feel unchallenged . so it is only adequate that the images which are used by this picture are simplistic  man to man doesn  t let the viewer decide what he thinks is right but is hammering its message in his head . joseph fiennes exemplifies this in his role he does his best to look concerned  genuinely moved and all the other emotions you can express with the single one facial expression his repertoire has to offer . add that the movie is overlong and loses its speed towards the end you would be easily led to the conclusion that man to man is not worth watching . but there are enough points to defend it it is entertaining  has some humorous scenes and the show  stealing kristin scott thomas . of course you should not compare it to humanistic masterpieces like the elephant man  david lynch  but you  ll be leaving the theatre satisfied . it tries to grab your heart  even if your brain thinks that it is too obvious  and succeeds most of the time .  ,0
maybe you shouldn  t compare  but wild style and style wars are original hip hop . beat street does have a lot of the original artists of early hip hop  but they  ve been obviously made clear that this could be their big break  of course for some it was and that  s nice . but if you view this as original hip hop culture you  re wrong . it  s overproduced and has a hollywood sauce . rather look for the first two movies i mentioned . they have convey the grittiness that comes with life in the ghetto . yes  the rating for this movie is low  but the reviews are mostly positive or even raving . this is probably because although the story  the acting  the dialogues and the direction all are dreadful  the music and dancing is what the people love about it . me  i do love the dancing but at the time thought that electro was the death of hip hop  i was so glad when round    a new generation of now classic hip hop artists appeared  like krs one  public enemy  ultramagnetic mc  s  jungle brothers  bizmarkie to name a few   and i still don  t like most of the beats in this movie and that is why it doesn  t work for me . i mean  wild style has not much of a story but the music there is great and authentic . of course tastes differ and that  s alright . but as far as i  m concerned  this movie is trash except for the break dancing and some of the music and so i can  t rate it higher than a  out of ten .  ,0
i almost burst into tears watching this movie . not from laughing but from the memories of a great rodney dangerfield movie . candyshack was his first and stole the movie  easy money had him at his best  and back to school is by far an    s classic masterpiece . then there was ladybugs and that  s when it started to show . poor rodney was getting old  meet wally sparks was a slight step up from ladybugs but not saying much  .  br    br   in my  wives rodney plays monte  a name he must love since that was his name in easy money  a rich  isnt he always  guy who loves women and gets married like its nothing . well now he inherits a huge piece of land and since the land was run by the amish  he inherits  wives . this sounds like a great idea for a dangerfield movie . the problem is everything . the script is so poor that rodney seems to be saying his one liners to the camera and all the side characters have nothing to do . the movie looks like it was shot on video with some really poor stunt sequences that are obviously not rodney . andrew dice clay plays a gangster who looks like he is dying to say the f word  which he should since the film is rated r but plays as if it was pg  and jerry stiller has a nice  minute cameo . don  t get me wrong  at times i did laugh at a few of rodney  s jokes but the poor man is getting way too old and way too slow . we can see his jokes coming from miles . and the film turns way too pc which thanks to the horrible      s  the    s and    s rodney just doesn  t work anymore .  ,0
  unhinged  is one strange little film  a forgotten slasher from the golden age of the genre . it  s hard to really write a satisfying review of this film simply because of the fact that the film is so unique . it  s plot is fairly overdone   three young women on their way to a rock concert get in a car crash and end up stranded at the mansion of an eccentric old woman and her spinster daughter . very quickly  the ladies realize something is not quite right when they hear strange breathing and noises from the attic . on top of that  the mother and daughter seem to have a very  very strange relationship  as they quarrel intensely in front of their houseguest at dinner . the old mother even goes as far as calling her daughter a whore and slut and accuses her of sneaking guys in at night to sleep with them . halfway through the film  when one girl finally decides she better wander off to find help  the killing begins .  br    br   as far as the acting goes  this film is at the bottom of the barrel . none of the three stranded girls can act  particularly the  lead  girl . it is almost unbelievable to hear them deliver their lines in the same  wooden tone throughout the film . the mother and daughter are better  but not much . the film is also quite dull in parts and really  really drags . the killings are gruesome  but nothing we haven  t seen before . however  as mentioned on here  the film really gains points with it brilliantly disturbing and gory ending . it comes totally from left field and has the same shock value as the ending the the camp classic  sleepaway camp .  unfortunately  the rest of the film is a bore and suffers from horrendous acting and boring  boring pacing . the isolated  creepy looking mansion and the dark  foreboding lighting does give the film a grainy realism  but that is quickly shattered when one of the characters attempts to act . it may be worth it if you can stick it out until the end  but i say you are better off just fast forwarding to the last   minutes .  out    ,0
this place in england during     . three orphans  carrie  charles and paul  are sent to live with miss price  angela lansbury  . she doesn  t want them but reluctantly takes them in . it seems she is studying to be a witch through a correspondence course with the college of witchcraft .  ok   i realize this is a family film but   college of witchcraft    come on    before she can finish the course though the college is closed because of the war      and she seeks down the head professor browne  david tomlinson  . and her and the kids travel around on a bed with the help of a magical bedknob .  br    br   i first saw this when i was  and vaguely remember loving it . it sure doesn  t hold up as an adult  the story is silly  even for a fantasy   the kids are terrible actors and one of them  charles  is incredibly obnoxious . also roddy mcdowall is third billed and only appears in two short scenes  there  s also a trip to the isle of naboombu which is run by animated animals . i thought that might be fun but the animation is poor  for disney  and it has a very violent and far too long soccer game between the animals . there are a few saving graces here lansbury and tomlinson are just great the songs  while forgettable  are pleasant the long dance sequence on portobello road is very colorful and full of energy and the oscar  winning special effects are still pretty impressive at the end . but the weak story line  poor animation and unlikable kids really pull this one down . i heard the extended version is even worse  i can only give this a  .  ,1
this was great . when i saw the japanese version first  it was probably the scariest movie i had ever seen . it was not blood and guts  it was eerie  atmospheric and terrifying . when the mother ghost lent over the bed in the japanese version  i nearly had a heart attack . . . i was concerned that the american version would be watered down  and that buffy would take away from the dark creepy nuances of the original version . i needn  t have been concerned . the makers of this movie wisely kept the same japanese people who were involved with the original movie on hand  and gave the direction of the movie to the same man . they also set it in japan in the same location  in the same house . in fact  the japanese director took pains to remake the same movie as it was in the original  the only difference was the casting of american actors . that actually turned into a benefit as it added the element of  strangers in a strange land  to the overall horror . not only were they being haunted by an absolutely terrifying and relentless ghost  but they were also stuck in a completely foreign land  having difficulty integrating into society . it just added to the overall anxiety built into the movie and i thought it was an excellent touch .  br    br   buffy actually does a very good job . she looks vulnerable and is able to convey her fear well . there are none of the smart aleck remarks that are so common to american horror movies  or one liners that detract from the overall darkness and horror of the characters  situation . in fact  it was easily as good as the ring which i also thoroughly enjoyed . i hope the future of american horror follows more closely the japanese new wave of horror started with the incredible success of ringu . we are finally getting movies that actually can be categorized as  horror         ,1
from everything i  d read about the movie  i was excited to support a film with a christian theme . everything about the movie was very unprofessionally done . especially the writing  without good writing a movie doesn  t have a chance . the writer  director said in an interview that he didn  t want to give away how the title relates to the story . believe me  it was no big surprise . i kept waiting for the teenage  young adult back  story to unfold  but it never did . as someone who has gone through a divorce  i was very disappointed . this movie would have been no comfort to me when i first went through the emotional turmoil that divorce can bring to your life as a christian   ,0
i  m from romania i  ll try to speak in english . all i want to say about this movie is that it is and will be my all time number one . seen it above   times at least and will see it for many years now . it has all the little things i like in a movie  it  s very touching makes me cry . shows a whole lot of twisted love things and questions about love and reality  and the true things that matter for different people . it so happens that for me this matters the most  the love  the soul of a man  he  s inner being  and this i see in this movie . perhaps for me it  s much more than a motion picture  it  s a proof in my mind that it could really exist and that you most make the best out of every moment you live with your soul mate . it  s a long way from reality to sci  fi  but . . what if . what if all the capitalism disappeared and economy would go down  would fall  we would all be concerned about other issues and my thought is that  on your death bed  the bigger thing you remember  is not the wealth  not the adventure  not the countries you visited and the people that remember you . but the true friends and your true love and the hope that after you die  all will be god damn perfect and people would be good and care more . watch this movie and probably it will guide you through your life like it did to me   hail from romania  ,1
i saw this documentary at the cannes film festival  in a small     seat cinema at the top of the main building at the cannes film festival .  br    br   i absolutely was into it . i love the mix of awesomely made fictional scenes . it is amazing set  design . the scenes look really like they were filmed in     ies or     ies .  br    br   and the music is so nice .  br    br   i rate this experience     .  br    br    spoilers ahead   br    br   the documentary tells about awesome blues  men  with black  and  white old  looking scenes of the black man playing the guitar and singing . it is really amazing . but this also mixes in new bands and that is maybe one thing i might dislike in this documentary . it is the too abundant use of links to modern rock  bands playing those blues songs in a modern way . i didn  t really appreciate their trashed way of playing such awesome blues songs . this is the same kind of un  perfect musical taste i found when watching wim wenders buena vista social club .  br    br   the documentary was such a standing  ovation at this first screening in the little cinema  that the next day this documentary was shown for everyone and normal tourists on the beach of the croisette at the open  air cinema . though the sand  the quality of the projection and the bad quality of the sound probably made it a difficult experience to enjoy for the thousands of people who were sitting in the sand that night .  ,1
freebird is the perfect marriage of road trip comedy  gang caper   stoner  film and feel  good british movie .  br    br   it is the brilliant lead characters that set this movie apart from other films in this genre . stars phil daniels  gary stretch and geoff bell have a great chemistry and make their characters hugely likable and realistic . the main story centres around their road trip from london to wales  and the adventures and mishaps that occur along the way . this small film also has a great heart  it is not just for bike fans  as it bases around the character  s relationships with each other including dreams and regrets  such as gary stretch  s fred longing for the family he left behind . the cinematography is also great  a love letter to the welsh countryside as well as capturing the grittiness of london streets and typical pub life in the welsh country towns .  br    br   stylish  slick  fantastic soundtrack  likable characters and funny storyline  i would recommend freebird in a heartbeat   ,1
after   seconds  you already realize that there was no real budget for this cheap knock  off . the story is taken from great movies like  texas chainsaw massacre  and  hills have eyes  . i like those kind of movies  even if they  re duplicated well  wrong turn  timber falls  carver  .  br    br   but  side sho  is hard to watch the actors are really bad  the dialogue is cheesy and the music is stupid and totally misplaced . you do not care at all what happens to the characters . the so  called bad guys are also not interesting at all and rather stereotypical . so how about the blood and gore  well there is some  although it is rather cheap and the action is executed very poorly .  points  just for the gore and blood but do understand that this is hardly worth a look  even for the gore  hounds . .  ,0
some very interesting camera work and a story with much potential . but it never comes together as anything more than a student  s graduate thesis in film school .  br    br   there are two primary reasons for this . fist  there is not a single likable character  not even a villain we might admire for his  her chutzpah . secondly  all the acting is awful  even from veteran willem dafoe . the ham is so plentiful here  you feel like you  re at a picnic  but one of those wretched company employee picnics where you drink too much cheap beer and get your hangover before you even stop drinking . then you eat an underdone hotdog and throw up .  br    br   all right  i  m being a little rough on a young director who might still go places  as i said  the camera work is quite good .  br    br   but i feel cheated  the blurb for this film suggests we will get to watch a  modern western   and the dvd packaging has pictures on it that suggest this as well  but nobody actually connected to the film  s making seems to know that this is the kind of film they  re supposed to be making .  br    br   that betrayal is what hurts but even without it  the fact remains that we don  t like these characters  we feel embarrassed for the actors  the story is hopelessly muddled  and in the last analysis  we just don  t care .  br    br   i took it out of the dvd player about half way through . but the rental store wouldn  t give me my money back .  br    br   now  that really hurts .  ,0
this is a funny film . it has all the usual disney components  music  great range of characters  story  appeal   entwined with superb animation and the excellent voice talents of less well known actors as those in say  antz  and  price of egypt  .  br    br   the characters work really well  and have a strong appeal  and the humour is aimed at a wide level which overcomes generational barriers . the movie is also presented in superb cinemascope format  which adds to the cinema experience .  br    br   call me crazy  but i have seen the film three times  and i intend on taking more friends to see it this weekend . many skeptics have seen this film on my recommendation and not been disappointed . i work in a multiplex  and i can honestly say that no  one has ever walked out of this movie without a sense of satisfaction .  br    br   see it  and don  t be put off because it is animated . you are sure to enjoy this movie  and make sure you stay for the end credits  the bloopers and out  takes at the end are the funniest part of the film  which is packed with laughs throughout .  ,1
i have seen this wonderful production  and i wonder if anyone can tell me anything about the actress who played the blacksmith  s wife  i am not sure of her character  s name . i went to byu with her and lost touch with her  her maiden name was kim luke  and i wonder if anyone has any info on her . she is not listed in the credits . this production was outstanding  a tear  jerker on all accounts  superb acting by all . i guess i don  t even want to put it in the general category of  acting   more like  portraying with feeling the amazing events that led to the opening of the heavens for this the final dispensation  . . . . . something like that . if anyone worked with kim or has a website or something please let me know    she was fantastic in her role  by the way . . . . thanks  melissa thorne  ,1
men in black  was a real disappointment for me . while the actors did a pretty good job  especially smith  there just isn  t a cure for a poor script once in production . the movie really had a  sequel  kind of feel  playing off partial events of the first film . the story was  in a word . . . bad  at best . it wasn  t thought out well  and seemed very choppy and incoherent at times .  br    br   in the first flick  the mib organization had a kind of  elite  force feel . you had a few special agents  and it had a  clandestine  kind of feel to it . in the sequel  the mib organization has a jrotc summer camp vibe .  br    br   the movie wasn  t terrible or anything . . it just lacked the  coolness   for lack of a better phrase  of the first movie . a lot of the same old humor was recycled from the first to the second  and didn  t really add any originality to the mib universe .  br    br   a perfect analogy would be episode  to the first  films . was it decent  yeah . is it worthy of bearing it  s title  not really .  ,0
i have seen it . it  s not  good  but interesting in an understated way . the boys in it are quite naturalistic but . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . the graphic  gratuitous final gang rape scene is repugnant and  oh yes  the arbitrary insertion of second world war footage is offensive in the way it attempts to compare real horror with this misogynistic contrivance . real atrocity is real  this film is just atrocious . however  the film has a look which can draw you in . but it seems to me that is the  emperor  s new clothes   but in fact in reverse . the film looks good  but the direction  story  content and final feeling you take away from this film is vacuous . if a feeling can be vacuous  this is it .  ,0
yet another remake of  fistful of dollars   sergio leone  s remake of kurosawa  s  yojimbo   suggested by the novel  red harvest   .  br    br   this one is strictly a b  movie taken as that  it is rather enjoyable . the direction is crisp  the acting full of verve  the limitations of its  direct  to  video  photography well  handled .  br    br   the weakness of the film is in the disastrous decision to marry the  fistful    yojimbo  plot to a sub  plot from leone  s  once upon a time in the west  . although leone directed both  fistful  and  west   his motivations behind the two films couldn  t be anymore different . the  man with no name   eastwood  is a borderline socio  path with a soft spot for broken families . harmonica  chaeles bronson  is obsessed with his own broken family  and obsessed with revenge . these two characters would not have had much to do with each other . in order to bring them together   gun crazy  has to twist it  s plot and complicate it until we lose track of which story we  re actually following .  br    br   but this is a b  movie after all  and filled with action and silliness it  s entertaining on that level  just don  t expect anything more .  ,1
i should have listened . i was warned  and still  i paid money for this  after reading all the reviews  after knowing the original is  so bad it  s good   and that part  does not fit into that category at all  still  even then  i couldn  t resist . exactly what happened here  part one was hilarious  it had so much politically incorrectness  and other crazy  fat entertainment  and this one  there just couldn  t possibly be a worse sequel on god  s green earth  not basket case   hell  not even troll  . this is truly the worst sequel in history and that  s really saying something considering the groundbreaking  bottom of the barrel qualities of the original . criminally insane part  was just a completely different brand of bad . shot on video  zero score  zero entertainment value     consists of flashbacks of the original  and on top of all that  crazy  fat ethel has lost a portion of her girth . i mean  honestly  is this some kind of sick joke    thank  s a lot  nick milliard .     ,0
on the surface the idea of omen  was good . it  s nice to see that the devil child could be a girl . in fact  sometimes  as in the exorcist  when girls are possessed or are devilry it  s very effective . but in omen   it stunk .  br    br   delia does not make me think that she could be a devil child  rather she is a child with issues . issues that maybe only a therapist  rather then a priest could help . she does not look scary or devilish . rather  she looks sulky and moody .  br    br   this film had potential and if it was made by the same people who had made the previous three films it could of worked . but it  s rather insulting really to make a sequel to one of the most favoured horror trilogies  as a made for tv movie special .  br    br   on so many levels it lets down . it  s cheap looking  the acting is hammish and the effects are typical of a tv drama . the characters do not bring any sympathy  and you do not route for them . i recently re  watched it after someone brought it for me for christmas  and it has dated appalling .  br    br   if your thinking of watching this  then i would suggest that you don  t . watch one of the others  or watch the exorcist  or watch the good son . just don  t waste your time on this drivel   ,0
this is one of the finest music concerts anyone will ever see and hear . i grew up when all my lovin  was brand new and to hear it again today by the original artist today is a measure of sir p mc  s power to spellbind any crowd of any age . this doco goes way behind the scenes to show us life on the road not just for the band but everyone down to the roadies . i saw this guy live in aussie     and can assure you his performance here on this dvd is no less than he gave almost   years ago . i have a huge  .  surround sound system that does do this justice and would recommend this anyone especially a beatles fan . this is the closest you will get to a beatles concert today . singer  songwriter  lead  rhythm  bass guitar  piano  ukulele  just pure genius . there are few entertainers who can stand alone with one instrument and hold the crowd in his hand . if you want note perfect music  buy a studio recorded cd . if you want to hear raw music as it is intended and spontaneous to the crowd  with all the excitement and emotion of the crowd  this dvd is for you .  ,1
what a great actor to have in such an awful story . . .  br    br   the film and its production  however  is quite good  even though set in london but with exteriors in bristol . no matter  see one cathedral  you  ve seen  em all  sort of .  br    br   the story however . . . is about a man born with the power to wreak death and destruction upon anybody and anything  should he so wish . with just a passing reference to true life instances of telekinesis  the narrative builds a picture of a man misused and misjudged as a boy  a teenager and finally as a man so much so  in fact  that he exacts vengeance at will  literally . over time  he comes to the conclusion that the whole world is heading the wrong way and thus sets out to destroy the lot  just by thinking about it   br    br   the trouble with the narrative  however  is that it tries to mix genuine scientific data about strange mental powers and merge it all with quasi  religious claptrap to produce a hodge  podge theory about it all . mixing fact and fantasy in this fashion rarely works  and i  m afraid richard burton had to overact awfully on some occasions when trying to sound convincing . his very best scene  however  is when he gave his wife and her lover a verbal pasting as they left his home sharp  witty and deadly dialog  delivered as only burton could .  br    br   a good supporting cast helps to make things look and sound a lot better  though  beginning with lino ventura  whom i last saw in garde a vu        as inspector brunel harry andrews as assistant commissioner the much under  rated lee remick as dr zonfeld derek jacobi as a publisher  towney  and a few other well known character actors .  br    br   i liked the way the story was presented  as flashback within flashback to fill in the back story and thus solve the immediate mystery of the attempted murder of morlar  richard burton   the writer with the killer disposition . up till that point  it was a good piece of visual detective work by brunel and his english sidekick . still  it was very predictable as it became quickly very obvious to me about the identity of the would  be murderer .  br    br   then  they went and spoilt it all in the last fifteen minutes . if you want a clue about what that is  think samson and delilah        from the illustrious cecil b . de mille  and how samson got the bad guys in the end . and  the very last scene is just plain stupid . why  because there are at least a hundred ways that morlar  s rampaging could have been stopped  absolutely .  br    br   shame  actually  because this could have been a lot better story and movie . i guess burton really needed the money .  br    br   if you  re burton fan  then spend the time to see that scene i mentioned above . otherwise  don  t bother .  ,0
no  it  s not the horror movie . . . this one is actually a love story .  br    br   the ring is a silent film from     that stars two boxers and the woman that comes between them . she loves the boxer known as  one round  jack . she loves him until the champion comes along  that is . even though she marries one round  she starts overtly flirting with the champion until the climactic final boxing fight between one round and the champion . she comes back to one round  s corner  just when things look their bleakest  and he miraculously finds the inner strength to win the fight and win his wife love back .  br    br   this film was very early in hitch  s career  but the limitations of the time must not have made him make a lasting film . although there are special film tricks  and some comedy relief  this film just does not hold up to any of his later work . it must have been extremely risqu for the time period though  with the shameless adulterous wife . that may have been the draw back in     . while looking through all of these old films  it is amazing how i think that they could be redone on today  s screen and really come off . maybe i should be the one . . . .  br    br   skip this movie unless you are planning on watching all of hitchcock  s films . you could fall asleep in the middle .  ,0
double exposure was a tremendous surprise . it contains outstanding acting  particularly from the underrated callan   fine cinematography and a compelling storyline . in other words  it  s one of the finest horror efforts to emerge from the     s .  br    br   callan plays a fashion photographer who experiences dreams of murdering his models  at a time when he is reunited with his psychologically volatile brother  who happens to be missing an arm and a leg  . when the models callan dreams about killing actually turn up dead  the photographer begins to doubt his own sanity . . . but there is more to the picture than he is seeing .  br    br   this film never received the praise it deserves . most critics and filmgoers lump it in with the horde of slasher films released at the same time  but it stands high above the bulk of that sorry lot . it  s clever and unique  which isn  t something one can comfortably say about most films of this genre  but it  s also passionately crafted and performed . double exposure is a gem of its kind .  ,1
this  along with  hare tonic   ranks as one of the best bugs cartoons  indeed one of the best bugs  ever . there are some comments about how bugs in these cartoons is  basic   meaning  i guess  that he is as yet not fully developed . i actually prefer this  basic  version from the mid    s  chuck jones  was the best version  who is actually more rabbit  sized and far more amusing than the eventual long  legged version who towered over yosemite sam and daffy duck . the latter  day bugs came to be too suave and sophisticated for my liking . also check out  hair raising hare        and  rabbit punch        for great examples of classic bugs and classic chuck jones .  ,1
i really enjoyed this movie . britney is an excellent role model for teens and should be more appreciated . this movie is about following your dreams and never giving up no matter what people might do or say to discourage and criticize you . holly fulfills her dreams just like britney .  br    br   there are times in everyones  lives when people judge them for what they are not who they are . watching this movie will make you understand that you are special in your own way and that you should follow your dreams no matter what happens .  br    br   i would like to thank britney for encouraging me and my friends to follow our dreams . she will never know how much that means to me . bravo britney . you are the greatest     ,1
this is a very dark and intriguing horror type thriller based on the idea of religious murders . the storyline centres on a deranged man who lives in texas  us who suddenly goes on a killing spree with his two young sons after being instructed by god to redeem the world of bad people .  br    br   bill paxton who directs this movie plays the deranged father who is known as the hand of god killer while matthew mcconaughey plays his finest performances to date as the oldest son  fenton meiks . the film revolves around fenton who decides he can no longer hold the burden of his murderous childhood alone and uses flashbacks to hauntingly tell the story to fbi agent wesley doyle  played by powers boothe  .  br    br   i cannot think of many movies that literally keep the viewer chained to their seat from start to finish and this is definitely one of them . even if you want to stop watching  you wont be able to because of the sheer power of this movie .  br    br   the directors have filmed this movie very well  and they help to set the plot through the good scenery . the acting in this movie is great but if there is any drawback it is that some parts are very powerful and may disturb some people .  br    br   whilst the concept of this film is very dark  the young children help to portray the idea through brilliant acting . this really is a spine tingly movie and it is guaranteed to have you at the edge of your seat throughout . i would highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys horror  disturbing and powerful movies or anyone who just wants to see something different .  br    br        ,1
though derivative   labyrinth  still stands as the highlight of the mid  half of the six  year  old show . finally a story allows welling to show how he has grown as an actor . it  s not easy playing a character that is the embodiment of  truth  justice  and the american way  on a weekly basis with very little variation . his performance  permitting him to show how one might react if he  she discovers that all that he knew may be a lie  was quite believable .  br    br   welling rose to the occasion marvelously .  br    br   as always  michael rosenbaum  as the  handicapped  lex  delivered  as did kristen kreuk as a too  sweet  to  be  believed lana . allison mack  the ever  present chloe  also scored as a slightly  off  her  rocker  version .  br    br   the use of an annoying hum in the background added to the tone of the installment and made for an engaging drama .  ,1

  written on the wind  is an irresistible  wonderfully kinky film  as only director sirk could have done it . the movie is submerged in a bucket full of freudian symbols  weird melodramatics and colorful contrasts . the connection between financial success and moral decay is the film  s main theme . sirk seems to suggest that sexual dysfunction is one of the side effects of capitalism . however  i prefer to see the movie as a prime example of what sirk could do with kitschy material . the palette of colors is particularly impressive . the acting in the film is great too . rock hudson and lauren bacall are terribly glamorous and give the film an aura of elegance  but the movie belongs to robert stack and dorothy malone  she deservedly won the best supporting actress oscar   who manage to keep the film at a boiling point . kudos to frank skinner  s pulsating score  russell metty  s brilliant camera work  every single shot is a masterpiece in itself   and the production design department . also  the title tune is a beauty . it  s an unforgettable movie .  ,1
this is an interesting left turn for reel   indies . two harbors is a bw   minute film from minnesota that features non  actors and is about two people finding a connection through a search for alien life . i applaud the boldness of the reel   programmers of thinking out  of  the  box when selecting this film . i just wish they had picked a stronger film to be bold with . as a matter of fact  i wonder if the choice had more to do with the uniqueness of the film than with the actual quality of the film itself  not that two harbors is completely without merit  but i  ll get to that a little later  .  br    br   as is common with independent films  two harbors is limited in terms of location . there are only two real locations  a large junk dealership market and a very teeny trailer  which is the home of the middle  aged main character  vic  played by alex cole . writer  director james vculek uses the market setting to provide exposition about vic  who is one of the dealers there . he has various people walk up to vic and start very long conversations that provides us with just two pieces of information  vic sells space toys  he prefers to call them  outer space action figures   and he is a caustic asshole . this is emblematic of one of the two key problems with two harbors  all the chatting . i  ve said it before and i  ll say it again  we are dealing with a visual medium and filmmakers need to work harder to tell their stories visually . there are exceptions  of course  but generally  endless patter is not so engaging on film  particularly if the dialogue is being used as exposition . pretty much all the conversations in the film are long and unnecessarily verbose . a notable example would be a few scenes which feature vic trying to play himself off as a boy scout leader in order to get a discount at a store . he argues with the clerk back and forth and these scenes don  t even advance the plot one iota . this is the kind of thing that makes even a   minute film feel long .  br    br   the other problem with two harbors is the acting . i may be a bit of a curmudgeon when it comes to performance in film  but i really don  t feel like there  s a good excuse for not having good actors in your films . there are plenty of good actors out there  many of which willing to work on low  budget projects  even in minnesota . many filmmakers eschew the importance of acting ability as being secondary to their visuals  but that is nave . in narrative film  making  next to the story  nothing is more important than the acting  performances . if you don  t believe the people enacting your story  your audience is lost .  br    br   originally  i thought vculek was using non  actors  but as the film went on  i decided that they were probably community theater  type actors . it wasn  t that they were uncomfortable on camera . it  s that they were overly theatrical  i . e . big  . granted  the best of the actors were the two leads  cole and catherine e . johnson as cassie  a lonely young girl that gets caught up in vic  s extra  terrestrial hunt . they seemed to have the most training  but they were still a little rough around the edges . the eccentricities they displayed seemed to be surface only  not coming from a real  organic place within . ms . johnson  in particular  is an interesting case . she definitely has a presence  a midwestern charm about her  but that charisma belies the multitude of issues her character is supposed to have . she struggles to portray the idiosyncrasies that stem from a supposed life of solitude and  slave   labor  relying on stock gestures like eye rolls  lip biting and stammering to suggest her discomfort with the outside world .  br    br   i mentioned in the first paragraph that two harbors is not completely without merit and here  s what i mean . without giving too much away  there is a fade to white an hour into the film . after that  the story takes a stunning turn  which allows the last fifteen minutes to be evocative and downright powerful  it  s like a sucker punch to the gut  but in a good way . it  s almost a huge relief to feel something after so long with these characters . the last five minutes of the film don  t have any dialogue at all and the result is the best part of the film  subtle  detailed  cole does his best work of the film  and most importantly  cinematic . then  with the closing credits comes the most staggering revelation of all  that it  s based on a true story  which got me to thinking . with all the dialogue  the minimal locations and the lack of cinematic qualities  it occurred to me that with two kick ass actors and a tightening re  write  two harbors might make a really kick  ass stage play  maybe even a one  act . if there are

  possible spoilers   br    br   someone once asked dr . seuss if they could secure the movie rights to his     christmas classic how the grinch stole christmas . he turned them down  insisting that no one could do better than the marvelous chuck jones tv special from      also in mind  perhaps  was his bitter experience writing the script to      s the      fingers of dr . t  . when the good dr . died in      his widow  audrey geisel  still obstinately refused to sell the movie rights . but with the commonplace use of cgi effects becoming a reality  mrs . geisel had a change of heart . universal made her a generous offer she accepted she also accepted the casting of jim carrey as the title character . supposedly she was satisfied with the final result . well  mrs . geisel  that makes one of us .  br    br   the film was given a             budget  which is more than even heaven  s gate cost  including the adjustment for inflation   which obviously went towards the very elaborate makeup  set design  and special effects  which are undermined  br    br   somewhat by the rather hazy cinematography  . unfortunately  it seems that none of that money was set aside to get a better script than what jeffrey price and peter s . seaman  scribes of who framed roger rabbit   which made much better  br    br   use of a high budget  turned in . whereas the tv special was a trim   minutes without commercials  this film tries to fill a running time of    minutes with more background information about the grinch . it turns out that  as a child  he was the subject of ridicule  including an especially humiliating experience one christmas at the age of eight . so it turns out that everything that ails our poor mr . grinch is directly because of the whos . trouble is  it seems like a rather long    minutes  with too much dead wood clogging up the story . that might not seem so bad if only the grinch were a little more . . . well  grinchy . the character that dr . seuss wrote and chuck jones later animated was a sly fox whose slick attempts to hijack the holiday season were undermined by his sudden change  and exponential growth  of heart . carrey  s grinch is a loud  hyperactive oaf and  at times  a thug who  when made the holiday cheermeister   trashes the whoville town square in anger  br    br    hopefully the scenery tasted as good as it looked  . this undermines the script  s attempt to make the grinch more sympathetic  with all the whos down in whoville so unsympathetic  at least in this interpretation  .  br    br   the whoville of dr . seuss  s vision was a small town populated by honest folk who knew in their hearts the true meaning of christmas . the whoville of the movie is a rather noisy and crowded place populated by spoiled  selfish  materialistic ninnies an obvious attempt to comment on american consumerism . this is offensively  br    br   hypocritical inasmuch as the film industry has benefitted greatly from american consumerism  and as this film contributed to it with a huge merchandising  br    br   campaign .  br    br   the film also expands and redefines the character of cindy lou who  a small but crucial character in the original . the innocent two  year  old waif who walked in on this spurious santa is now older and wiser  constantly questioning the false values of the whos and trying to understand the grinch  s point of view  her one major scene from the original is re  enacted  making it seem out of character  . she  br    br   seems to be the only one who would ever know that christmas is more than just gifts and decorations  thus making her a completely different  and more annoying  character .  br    br   those who celebrate christmas should sooner accept a lump of coal in their  br    br   stockings on the morning of december   than a copy of this overlong  overacted  excruciatingly tedious  ham  handed  crude attempt to turn the children  s classic into a feature film . it proves once and for all that darkness  vulgarity   br    br   manipulation  and heavy  handedness are inadequate substitutes for charm  wit  sincerity  and heart . the folks at universal should get down on their collective knees and thank god that this truly bilious     million stink bomb grossed     million domestically or they  d not be here today . furthermore it made mike myers  the cat in the hat possible   ,0
set in the   s   seed  centers around convicted serial killer max seed  will sanderson   who killed    people in  years . he is sentenced to death  but in the electric chair he doesn  t die  even after being shocked three times .  br    br   detective matt bishop  michael par  and other officers cover up this secret by burying seed alive . seed breaks out and goes after the people who put him in his living coffin .  br    br   filmed by the worst director in the world  uwe boll    seed  is nothing more than a snuff film about trying to stretch the envelope of decent society and fails to deliver in any aspect of a storyline . and he said this is based on true events because if a person survives the electric chair after being shocked three times  they will be set free . this is an urban legend  and it would never happen . much like boll  s other abominations   alone in the dark  for one    seed  is just utterly horrendous .  ,0
i am a huge ziyi zhang fan and will go to any film to see her which is what took me to purple butterfly . as much as i wanted to like this movie  i have to agree with many others who have commented on it . it is very confusing and also extremely slow . because all of the film appears to have been shot with a hand held camera  significant portions of it are out of focus .  br    br   the film has very little dialog and what there is doesn  t tell you much . there are endless scenes of people just standing around smoking cigarettes or sitting in a room staring at each other with no conversation . the way the film time shifts is also very confusing and hard to follow . even having read a number of reviews beforehand and having a general idea what the film was about  i still had a difficult time understanding what was going on .  br    br   i knew beforehand that the movie was not remotely similar to previous ziyi zhang starring films but was looking forward to seeing her in something different but unfortunately i was ultimately disappointed . she never smiles in this film although admittedly most of the time she doesn  t have anything to smile about . i could have done without the sex scenes as they were about as sexless and without any obvious feeling between the participants as you could hope to find .  ,0
not only was this movie better than all the final season of hlots . but it was better than any movie made for tv i have ever seen   br    br   looking at the  top     i see that only one small screen movie has made it how the grinch stole christmas . i think it is time to increase that group to  .  br    br   i will admit that the original series had several shows that were better than this  but i didn  t mind . i just loved being able to enter the world of the baltimore homicide squad again   ,1
with one of my very favorite actors  james spader  i expected this film to be at least tolerable . it wasn  t . after the first half hour i watched the rest of it with the remote control in my hand so the fast forward was at the ready . so trite  so standard  one knows what  s going to happen in each scene . one can even predict the dialogue word for word . this is one of those movies that makes one scratch ones head and say   how did this movie ever get made   in an effort to say something positive  i  ll add that there are some mildly entertaining special effects . but  on the whole  if you  ve seen  sci  fi movies  or you are over  years old  do yourself a favor and skip this one .  ,0
this entry is certainly interesting for series fans  like myself   but yet it is mostly incomprehensible . the plot is confusing  as is the sequel continuity . some striking effects  to be sure  but we never find out what it all really means .  br    br   try to see the  nc     workprint version which contains the gore that was cut to be re  rated  r  .  ,0
although nothing can compare to vampires vs . zombies . . . in any realm of film making i will attempt to judge this movie .  br    br   firstly  the special effects were breath  taking . when there was an explosion on the television screen i thought my entire house was going to explode  and when automatic machine guns were fired i thought the shells were landing on the floor right next to me . simply stunning my friends .  br    br   but the scene when the jack black sound  a  like is giving the worst monologue i have ever heard i nearly killed myself  but don  t worry since he was getting blazed in the movie he can pass his awful acting off on  i must be high  . seriously  he must have watched himself mindlessly babbling about non  congruent thoughts that make absolutely no sense and just added that he must be  high  to justify his awful acting . well if you can say that to excuse terrible acting then if you talked to the writers  directors  executive producers  sponsors you will probably get the same response . . . seriously .  br    br   with a production team called  shock  o  rama  i was shocked i didn  t place a sawed  off shotgun in my mouth and ended my life after this shockingly terrible excuse for a movie was played .  br    br   if you want to see this movie  then you should be murdered  br    br   yours truly   br    br   the general  ,0
i very much enjoyed  the revolution will not be televised  . it gave me  once again  a positive feeling about the power of people to decide for themselves how they wish to be governed .  br    br   it is unfortunate that in venezuela the twenty percent of wealthy citizens have made all of the decisions for the eighty percent of the poor for decades  if not centuries . however  when their coup failed after the interim government dissolved the supreme court  and the constitution  and the ombudsman  and the electoral boards  and all civil rights  no one took the plotters out behind a barn somewhere and shot them . they haven  t even gone to jail . the major plotters are living in florida  carrying on . and the protection that they had was the  bolivarian constitution  passed by a large majority of the venezuelan people . it is not only history that bites . democracy can give you one hell of a nip if you let it loose . and in venezuela it is loose .  ,1
snl is pretty funny but people who say this is like watching a short skit on snl is a little dumb minded . it  s nothing like snl  it  s just a stupid piece of crap .  br    br   andy samberg tries to act like jon heder but fails . although jon heder is only funny in napoleon dynamite andy tries his hardest and people think he  s funny .  br    br   only funny people in the movie were danny mcbride and bill hader . the only part that was decently funny with andy was the pool part .  br    br   they could have made the  quiet place  a lot better if they didn  t make the falling scene  freaking minutes .  br    br   the part where he  s pronouncing his h  s more is retarded . they try going with it too long and half the time it looks like andy is laughing while he acts . . . he  s a horrible actor and doesn  t deserve to be in a movie .  br    br   this movie is a joke and is for the simple minded people with the brain of a   year old level of comedy . which is about half the united states .  ,0
this is the last of four swashbucklers from france i  ve scheduled for viewing during this christmas season the others  in order of viewing  were the uninspired the black tulip       from the same director as this one but not nearly as good   the surprisingly effective lady oscar       which had originated as a japanese manga   and the splendid cartouche       . actually  i had watched this one not too long ago on late  night italian tv and recall not being especially bowled over by it  so that i was genuinely surprised by how much i enjoyed it this time around  also bearing in mind the baffling lack of enthusiasm shown towards the film here and elsewhere when it was first announced as an upcoming dvd release from criterion  .  br    br   incidentally  fanfan la tulipe has quite a bit in common with the afore  mentioned cartouche not just cast and crew members  producers georges dancigers and alexandre mnouchkine  cinematographer christian matras  actor noel roquevert  but plot  wise as well  in fact  the hero is a womanizing soldier  jean  paul belmondo  s cartouche had also had a brief military spell  who  s loved by a fiery girl  in this case  gypsy gina lollobrigida  while he  s himself obsessed by an impossible love  here  it  s none other than the king  s daughter   as in the later film  too  fanfan  an ideally cast gerard philipe who  ironically  is so full of life here that one finds it hard to believe that he would be stricken down by cancer within  years  time  is flanked by two fun  loving yet cowardly men  one of them is actually his superior officer and the heroine  s own father  and opposed by an unscrupulous figure within his own ranks  the ageing roquevert  with whom the hero eventually engages in a rooftop duel since he too has amorous designs on the gypsy girl    for the record  lollobrigida will rejoin philippe in her next film  rene clair  s delightful romantic fantasy les belles de nuit       .  br    br   fanfan proved to be a big box  office hit on its home  ground and even copped a surprising  but well  deserved  best direction award at cannes over more renowned films like an american in paris        detective story        othello  umberto d . and viva zapata  in fact  its popularity ensured its re  release in a computer  colored version  presumably for the benefit of viewers who wouldn  t touch a black  and  white product with a ten  foot pole  and the criterion dvd itself contains a sample from this variant being obviously a foreign  language title  there  s also the dubious choice of an english  dubbed soundtrack but  even if these proved not especially painful to sit through considering  when all is said and done  there  s simply no substitute for the original   br    br   fanfan la tulipe  a nickname given the hero by a young genevieve page as the celebrated madame de pompadour  contains about as much comedy as  the expected  action and romance while some may find this overwhelming  i don  t agree myself as i enjoyed the sharply satirical narration and  on the whole  this combination is comparable with jerzy skolimowski  s equally droll the adventures of gerard       . that said  the swordfights here are remarkably forceful for an essentially lighthearted enterprise  particularly a scuffle in the woods and the ambush at a convent  and the film itself rather adult at times  with numerous allusions to sexuality as well as coarse language adopted throughout  when viewed back  to  back with vintage hollywood fare as i did now the climax  then is quite ingenious the enemy forces  who  amusingly  are made to speak in speeded  up gibberish   are depleted by our heroic trio alone  much to the king  s amazement who  as portrayed by marcel herrand  best  known for his role of leader of the parisian underworld in marcel carne   s children of paradise        is himself something of a lecher .  br    br   p . s . an italian tv channel has been threatening to screen christian  jaque  s promising champagne for savages       for months now but  despite programming it three times already  with a tentative fourth one slated for next week   they have yet to show it even so  i do have three more films of his in my unwatched vhs pile  equally culled from late  night italian tv screenings   the three  hour epic la chartreuse de parme       also starring gerard philippe   the second twin       and the legend of frenchie king       with brigitte bardot and claudia cardinale  .  ,1
the marriage of maria braun  mmb  is about a german girl  maria  getting married to a german soldier  herman braun  just at the ending of the war . after being married for half a day and a night  herman is send to the front again . to make ends meet  maria starts working at a bar for mainly american soldiers and get to know a black soldier . she got word that herman died at the front  and things develop between her and the american soldier . herman walks in on them  in bed  and after a confrontation between him and the american  maria killed the american . herman admits to the murder  ends up in jail and maria vows to wait for him . the country is in shambles one sees people leaving everything that they are busy with for a cigarette . there are food shortages . it is in short  a time of survival of the fittest .  br    br   basically this film projects maria  s attitudes  those attitudes she permits herself under the mentioned circumstances  as a metaphor for germany  s loss of soul after they lost the war  and how it proceeds to rebuild itself . for example  maria has the following conversation with a peddler  played by fassbinder himself   the peddler tries to sell her an excellent copy of kleist and she remarks that  kleist burns out to quickly  it does not provide enough heat for the cold  . the peddler answers  that  s another way to look at it . right now  it  s probably the correct way  .  br    br   maria meets a french  german business man  karl oswald after she bargains her way into the first class train compartment . she decides to get involve with karl   you  re not having an affair with me i  m having an affair with you  . she also takes responsibility in the company  and after a while has the complete trust of the firm . when karl says  i suppose we  ll just have to wait for a miracle  she replies  i prefer making miracles  then wait for them  . in her own words  she has become the  mata hari of the economic miracle  .  br    br   in a lot of fassbinder  s films he tried to expose the psychological processes which lie behind social mechanisms  see freud   in other words  he liked pointing his camera at the bullsht  the false social mechanisms  the pretending . the direct approach maria takes in this film is successful to convey this ideology . for example  she phones karl and when he picks up the phone her request is straight to the point  i need someone to sleep with  . as fassbinder said  the emotions people felt did not exist at all and were only a kind of sentimentality which we thought we needed to be properly functioning members of society  . he also remarked that his films are anti emotional .  br    br   i particularly liked the scene when karl and maria meet in the munich restaurant  apparently  frequently visited by hitler himself  . maria appears in control and karl a bit on the down side  as if maria  s  brutal honesty  wears him out  as if he is not completely up to the situation anymore . karl says  i have to tell myself over and over that i love life  . maria replies  that  s life isn  t it . as if we signed a contract to enjoy life . and then we go out to eat and talk about food  . i guess this is also about fassbinder attitudes on relationships  to never submit completely to anyone . and why would you  if the central matter of most of his films is about  what love becomes in this society  a commodity  an instrument of power  a weapon .   br    br   it was remarked that it is typical fassbinder to have the scenes with maria and betti walking in expensive dresses in the ruins after the war  with these clothing essentially the wrong period . what i think he wanted to portray here were those attitudes  when you feel bad  that  you can always put on your make up and face the day looking great  . but  fassbinder was not interested in perfection . any mistakes made in a film could just be corrected in the next project . since he completed films  approximately  a year  the way other people rolled cigarettes  it is not peculiar that this film has some very bad scenes . peter marthesheimer  who wrote most of the script  mentioned that fassbinder likely dreamed up the whole scene with maria and the american in the park  overnight .  br    br   hanna schygulla is brilliant as maria . mostly  she just stares bluntly into the camera . in maria  s own words  it is a bad time for emotions . but  i like it like that  .  br    br   there are different opinions about the end . after karl died of a hart attack  herman finally shows up .  herman left for australia after he got out of prison  to  become human again  .  after the testament is delivered  made out to her and herman in half   maria forgets to close the gas on the stove when she lights her cigarette  and blow her and herman up . for me it is obvious that she just did that by accident . at the same time  she must have been rattled when her dreams finally seem about to come true . she must have felt as if she was not herself anymore . she felt as if she had outlived herself .  ,1

the thing about calling  house of the dead  the worst movie of all time is that it  s really not . there are worse movies out there . i watch alot of hong kong ninja movies that are basically the result of an unfinished japanese police drama having footage of ninjas inserted at the end to create something that could technically be called  a movie .   br    br   house of the dead is however one of the worst films i  ve ever seen at the theatres . walking out half way through  i actually felt i was somewhat dumber for having set through   minutes of this piece of garbage .  ,0
there  s really not a lot to say about las vegas lady . it  s harmless enough  but it is little more than a dull heist film from the   s . the movie is neither as clever nor as sexy as it strives to be . the plot is a retread of the tired old casino robbery storyline that  s been done to death . except in the case of las vegas lady  i think the robbery plot was designed by a  year  old . the plan involves three women  one to unnecessarily and in plain view scale the outside of the circus cicus building  one to pose as a waitress only to blow her cover at the first opportunity  and one to stand around exposing her cleavage . that  s pretty much it . intricate  huh  other than stella stevens and her aforementioned breasts  the other women involved in the plot aren  t particularly memorable . las vegas lady co  stars stuart whitman . when not pawing stevens  his involvement in the movie is highlighted by one of the most idiotic gun fights ever put on film .  br    br   i really wanted to like this movie . it does have that   s feel to it that i always enjoy and some nice shots of las vegas circa     . but the movie itself is too dull to rate any higher than a      and that  s probably overstating it . in the end  las vegas lady is a waste of some perfectly good cleavage .  ,0
this wrestlemania just didn  t do it for me . while some things  such as the battle royal and involvement of celebrities were a throwback to the good old days  so to speak  it seemed to be more of a highbrow  in your house  than anything else . above average . . . worth it for several matches such as the tag team title match  although worthy of note is that the title change meant nothing  as it was reversed the next night .  ,1
playwright sidney bruhl  michael caine  has had a series of flop plays after a huge hit . he receives a play written by a student of his  clifford anderson  christopher reeve  which is fantastic . it  s so good sidney says he would kill for it . will he   br    br   a thinking man  s thriller . it was originally a play . . . and it shows . it  s mostly on one set and all talk but i was never bored . it  s very well  written with plenty of twists and a good cast working full force . caine is just great as bruhl   another one of his great performances . reeve is  surprisingly  very good . i never thought much of him as an actor  but he  s really good in this role . dyan cannon does wonders with an underwritten role as bruhls  wife . irene worth is also good  and quite funny  as helga ten drop  a psychic . however  her accent did get on my nerves . director sidney lumet does very well with his one set . the camera is always moving and keeps your attention going .  br    br   extreme spoiler dead ahead      my only complaint is that two gay characters in this movie turn out to be raging sociopaths and it also contains one of the most unromantic kisses i  ve ever seen   but these are mild complaints .  br    br   a very good thriller . critics hate this movie  for some reason  and it seems to have completely disappeared since it premiered in     . that  s too bad   it deserves better .  ,1

this film was made in saskatchewan and manitoba parks and returned the world eye again to what little of the  wild western canada  is left . when archie began to write his stories for the papers the thought of the day was to tame the wilderness and convert  absorb the first nation peoples .  br    br   the film puts forward and asks the question why would a well  educated  obviously talented englishman become an indian   br    br   archie  as an english boy dreams about becoming something but grasping the full meaning of that dream is unique and priceless  no mater what it is . sounds like a famous puppet story doesn  t it .  br    br   in my opinion  i saw archie become my living image of the  cigar store indian  a very wooden character and not real at all  very well done acting on the part of mr . brosnan . he also portrayed the wild indian in the dance scene for the tourist . the fullness and or reality of it weren  t realized till he met and married his wife  annie .  br    br   annie pushed archie in a direction that would bring him to the forefront of the englishman  s world stage  not as himself but grey owl  an canadian native of the wilderness frontier .  br    br   this is the closest archie get to becoming the noble savage prototype .  br    br   mr . brosnan  s interpretation as well as the directors is both well done . i have watched documentaries on grey owl and i think this is a good big screen movie to add to my collection .  br    br   spoiler  i thought the final scenes with archie going to meet the grand council of chiefs was a great a great moment in the film .  br    br   very beautiful canadian lake scenery and real  grey owl  locations .  br    br    ,0
i loved the first  azumi  movie . i  ve seen ms . ueto in a variety of her tv appearances and i  ve seen my fair share of samurai and ninja flicks . i have to say that this movie was much weaker than i  d expected .  br    br   given the movie  s cast and set up in  azumi   they should have been able to do a much better job with this movie  but instead it was slow  plodding in parts  and sprinkled with very poor  unconvincing  and wooden acting .  br    br   when they bothered to reference the first movie  they did so in a manner that was pretty loose and weak . in  azumi   the title character is the best of a group of superior killers . in  azumi   she seems somehow diminished and less  impressive .  br    br   that  s not to say it was a total loss . there were a few decent fight scenes and some over  the  top characters . unfortunately  the movie suffers overall from the simple fact that shusuke kaneko and yoshiaki kawajiri are not ryuhei kitamura and isao kiriyama . the latter two truly captured the  manga  feel in their screenplay whereas the former never quite  got it .   ,0
sitting on the front porch of his burbank home  ted mapes told me that he and reed hadley wore the exact same size in every item of clothing except hat .  br    br   ted  one of the greatest of the stunt men  said that every time zorro put on his mask  he was the one on the screen .  br    br   that was a little bit of an exaggeration there were times that zorro was obviously reed hadley  but in the stunts we can be satisfied it was ted at work .  br    br   and what stunts   zorro  s fighting legion  is  as witness the comments here  one of the greatest of serials . it is exciting and generally very well made .  br    br   reed hadley was a fine actor  and  as someone else commented  he made a very good fop .  br    br   but  admittedly  it is the action that makes this movie so great .  br    br   and what else could we expect  with direction by that excellent team  witney and english  with great music from the amazingly prolific william lava  the listing here says he was uncredited  but that is incorrect those other composers listed here were indeed uncredited  and i don  t know if they did write any of the music   it sounds like lava   and with villainy from  among others  the great charles king  and with dozens of bit parts   br    br   also noteworthy was a villain played by the radio tarzan  jim pierce  who was edgar rice burroughs  son  in  law .  i urge you to read his mini  bio .   br    br   there is one chapter that slows things down depressingly  but  heck  it  s only a few minutes long  maybe    and when you wade through it  well  you  re back to the excitement .  br    br   turner classic movies deserves a great big thank you for presenting this excellent serial  and we should ask tcm to bring us more .  br    br   and we should thank everyone involved that we get to see it as a chapter  play  or serial  and not as a re  cut feature .  ,1
d . w . griffith could have made any film he wanted to after the enormous financial success of  the birth of a nation   he chose to make the most technically ambitious film to that date   intolerance .  he took a risk with such innovations in film montage and form  and the well  known financial train wreck resulted . buster keaton doesn  t take that kind of a risk with  three ages   a parody of  intolerance .  this is keaton  s first feature  length film of his own  he only acted in  the saphead   . he had the fallback plan of dividing the three episodes in this film into three separate shorts  which griffith did do with  intolerance .  keaton didn  t have to . chaplin had already succeeded with feature  length comedies  so if keaton was taking a risk here  it was completely calculated .  br    br   chaplin had already done a parody of another film  too  with  burlesque on carmen        . keaton appears to allude to that film  as well . the wrestling scene in the ancient rome episode references the swordfight that turns into a wrestling match in chaplin  s film . the comical distance from the plot of both scenes is the same  too . furthermore  chaplin  s film imitated the glossy style of demille  s  carmen   and chaplin  s film seemed a tribute to that film . keaton doesn  t attempt the radical editing  narrative structure or monumental nature in his parody  but it seems respectful of  intolerance  nonetheless . at least  the stories aren  t told completely straightforward as in other post   intolerance  films  such as dreyer  s  leaves from satan  s book   blade af satans bog       and fritz lang  s  destiny   der mde tod       . there is some mild jumping back and forth between episodes .  br    br   where keaton did take risks  however  is in his physical  daredevil comedy . that  s keaton unintentionally failing to jump across buildings in the modern episode . reportedly  he was convinced to alter the scene rather than attempt the jump again . and  it wasn  t just keaton who took risks the anachronistic baseball gag  for example  was rather dangerous . thus  although in a different way  keaton  like griffith  took risks with his big film . and  i think they both succeeded .  ,1
eytan fox  whilst generally leaning on the apologist side of israeli politics  has made several quite interesting films in the past such as  walk on water  and the simply wonderful film   yossi  jagger  . in  the bubble   however  he has taken this illogical and unfair approach to the extreme .  br    br   far from giving this film a standing ovation  the people at the screening i attended quietly got up and left . i also quietly left  fuming with anger at such a ridiculously one  sided film that translates self  preservation as racist bullying  and racist bullying  and terrorism  as outbursts of justified anger which implies that arabs are so wronged by the evil israelis that they react in anger to a constant stream of one  sided israeli aggression against them  and that they  therefore  should not be held responsible for their actions .  br    br   this film wasn  t worth the money i paid for the ticket  indeed  i considered demanding my money back   and was basically an israeli apeing of the palestinian film  paradise now  . if you want to be an anti  israeli  then by all means watch this film  as it really justifies just such a belief system . the fact that this film was made by an israeli director and  even worse  such a talented israeli director  is a crying shame . indeed  just how israel can be surprised to be regarded as a pariah state when israelis themselves make such anti  israel propaganda  beggars belief .  br    br   what a shameful  horrid little film   ,0
great movie  enough laughs and action for any audience .  br    br   since the last person who posted on this movie took it upon themselves to call woody allen incestuous and not comment on the film  here i am .  br    br   the film follows an unlikely duo  johansson and allen  as they follow a tip given to them by the ghost of a recently deceased english reporter . their search takes them into the home of the killer  and eventually to a somewhat tragic end . but don  t let the plot fool you  the film truly is hilarious and the acting is superb .  br    br   it seems that as directors reach a certain age they really get things right . clint eastwood  allen and pollack all seem to making some of the most imaginative work of their respective careers . also  from watching the movie in a pact theater  you can just tell that people really love woody allen and are ready for him to really make a comeback . the second he walked on screen audience lit up . there  s just something about the man and he really shines in scoop .  br    br   check it out  it  s worth the trip .  ,1

this quasi j  horror film followed a young woman as she returns to her childhood village on the island of shikoku to sell the family house and meet up with old friends . she finds that one  the daughter of the village priestess  drowned several years earlier . she and fumiko  another childhood friend  then learn that sayori  s mother is trying to bring her back to life with black magic . already the bonds between the dead and living are getting weak and the friends and villagers are seeing ghosts . nothing was exceptional or even very good about this movie . unlike stellar j  horror films  the suspense doesn  t really build  the result doesn  t seem overly threatening and the ending borders on the absurd .  br    br   this movie is like plain white rice cooked a little too long so that it is bordering on mushy . sometimes you get this at poor asian restaurants or cook your own white rice a little too long . you end up eating it  because you need it with the meal  because what is chinese or japanese food without rice  but it almost ruins the meal because of the gluey  gooey tastelessness of it all .     http   blog . myspace . com  locoformovies  ,0
daniel day  lewis is christy brown  a victim of cerebral palsy who uses  my left foot  to write and paint in this incredible     film . the movie also stars brenda fricker as christy  s mother  ray mcanally  fiona shaw and hugh o  conor . their brilliant performances  great script and wonderful direction by jim sheridan help to paint a vivid portrait of christy brown  an artist and writer who died in     at the age of   .  br    br   brown was born into a lower middle  class catholic family where his mother was constantly pregnant    children in total    of whom survived  . his father considered christy mentally retarded as well as physically handicapped  but he would not permit his son to go into a home . the children in the family would bid goodbye to him each day as they went off to school  and then his mother would feed him and talk to him .  br    br   in the movie  fricker conveys the sense of a woman who  despite being surrounded by a huge family  needs someone to talk to . christy doesn  t talk back . eventually a cart is found for him to ride in  and the neighborhood kids  all of whom have known him since he was a baby  include him in all of their activities . the only part of his body that works really well is his left foot  and when the kids find out how well he kicks  they put him into soccer games for just that purpose . one of the nicest parts of the film is the relaxed way the in which the other children treat him .  br    br   there are many powerful scenes  but none as powerful as christy writing  mother  on the floor holding a piece of chalk between his toes .  he  s a true brown   his father declares  hoisting him on his shoulders and carrying him to the pub . walking into the pub  he announces   my son  s a genius .  things change when christy grows older because he has a young boy  s desires and emotions . he develops crushes  is rejected and goes more into himself  turning to painting . eventually he goes into therapy in a nearby clinic and works with a therapist  eileen  fiona shaw  at home . he falls in love with her . when he finds out she  s engaged  he nearly goes crazy . but he survives to live  to paint  to write  three books in total  and to love again .  br    br   because it  s a film  by necessity certain things had to be left out and characters combined . brown wasn  t actually diagnosed with cerebral palsy for some time  which was left out of the movie . the therapist eileen is actually a combination of three important therapeutic figures in christy  s life  and though we know that his mother believed he had a good mind  in truth  she worked very hard with christy when he was a child teaching him the alphabet  etc . also  before mary  christy had a    year relationship with the woman to whom he dedicated  my left foot .  and the typical hollywood ending   years before his death where neglect by his wife may have been a factor  doesn  t finish the story .  br    br   despite all of that  christy brown  s biopic is incredibly powerful  all the more so because of two performances hugh o  conor as young christy and daniel day  lewis as the adult christy . o  conor  s facial expression and the way he drags his warped body is gut  wrenching . one is exhausted for him and heartbroken at the same time .  br    br   and what can be said about daniel day  lewis  one of the greatest actors in the world  he brings christy totally to life  a fully fleshed out  intelligent human being capable of swearing  becoming angry  bitter  drunk  pushy  lecherous  funny and loving . a well  deserved oscar won in the same year that tom cruise was nominated for  born on the fourth of july .  i remember someone writing a letter to the editor somewhere that cruise was so sensational  what was wrong with the academy  uh  nothing for a change . nothing at all .  br    br   brenda fricker is amazing as christy  s mother  who never stops believing in him and what he can do and who holds her family and husband together during the hard times . the wonderful thing about fricker  s performance is that the support  love and work ethic seem to come naturally to the mother . the character would never consider herself a heroine or as someone doing something out of the ordinary . fricker shows us a religious but not fanatic woman who believes her duties on earth are to be a good wife and mother . and no matter what  even when her husband is out of work  throws their daughter out of the house for being pregnant  whatever  she manages . she saves money for christy  s wheelchair  she receives photos of her daughter and the baby  she starts building a room for christy in the back of the house . all part of a day  s work . a performance worthy of the oscar she received .  br    br   brown  s life was more complicated than this inspiring film  but this is an amazing achievement by all involved and a must  see .  ,1
even with a cast that boasts such generally reliable names as val kilmer and lisa kudrow  wonderland fails to yield any sense of depth to this film . it barely brushes the surface of the incidents that happened on that july night in     . kilmer just goes through the motions as john holmes and kudrow and kate bosworth are both hopefully miscast in the other two lead roles as holmes  s wife and underage girlfriend  respectively . the rest of the cast has such small roles that it  s impossible to get any dimensions from them . the film also stars carrie fisher  ted levine  franky g  mc gainey  dylan mcdermott and a cameo from paris hilton .  ,0
first of all  this plot is way overdone  girl wants to make it  everyone loves her  snobby girl intervenes  all looks lost  girl pulls through  everyone loves her again etc . throw in the fitting in thing  an attractive male crushing on the heroine  plus single  parent troubles and it  s so predictable that you can practically recite along with it .  br    br   second of all  i really hate how they keep on dissing classical music . they send out the message that everyone involved in classical music is uptight and snobby and close  minded  in fact  i don  t recall the quote exactly  but i remember at one point in the movie  holly says   why do they have to be so uptight . . . so classical   it  s really insulting how label classical music in this way .  br    br   third  i  ve went over it dozens of times  but the only reason that i can think of for making this movie is to promote britney spears . there just isn  t any point at all .  br    br   and oh yeah  while the actress who portrayed holly  i  m not sure whether that was really her singing or not  had a reasonably good voice  it wasn  t as amazing as they were making it out to be  especially when she was belting . she was oversupporting the whole time .  br    br       stars .  ,0
monster  he was great i loved the special  effects which created this monster which looked like an updated version of  the creature from the black lagoon .  the scenes with this beast roaming the land and capturing people ranged from good to jaw  dropping .  br    br   social commentary much of the story takes place in the quarantine area as the doctors  under orders from the government  state that sars  like disease is out there . in a nutshell  we get the familiar government cover  up story . you know  i expect this liberal paranoid mindset with hollywood films always painting our government as corrupt  but it looks like the koreans are copying the format  and it  s very tedious . in here  it takes away from the excitement and suspense of this  monster .  it just drags the film down . the main family featured in the film has to watch from a distance while the young girl in their family  presumed dead  was hauled off by the creature .  br    br   moral a typical  don  t pollute the water  message because this is what can happen  a horrible mutated monster . this used to be the anti  nuclear bomb message from the     when radiation caused giants ants  spiders  fish or whatever in those schlocky sci  fi films . now its  environmental issues  that are the focus .  br    br   the humor this was mostly stupid . i normally laugh at slapstick but this wasn  t funny . i don  t know if the korean sense of humor is that pitiful  or the film was purposely trying to be ultra  corny with a take on the old  godzilla  movies . let  s hope it  s the latter .  br    br   transfer  the video transfer was good . this was a sharp  looking picture and sound was decent with a lot rear  speaker crowd noise . i watched this in korean with the english subtitles . that might have been a mistake as the korean guttural voice sounds got annoying after a half hour .  br    br   overall  this had a promise but turned out to be a big letdown and even boring in too many spots  which is inexcusable for a modern  day monster film . two hours was way too long for this story . how this film drew record crowds in korea i don  t know . they must not have much in the way of films to enjoy and support .  ,0
this was the worst movie i have ever seen and i  ve seen a lot of bad movies . first of i  m from kansas this movie does not have a shred of truth in it at all . its like they took btk name and made up the rest . on top of that it looks like someone was like i  ve only got    bucks here take it and make a movie and oh yeah don  t worry about researching btk at all just make up something . seriously pure dookie no one should ever see this movie . the slaughtering cows scenes and making his victims eat stuff and describing animal slaughter btk did none of these things but the movie does so for the love of god never see this god awful movie . the made for tv ones are way better and way more accurate  ,0

orson welles manages to knock me on my ass with every picture of his i see . lady of shanghai is on the same level as his other masterpieces  the magnificent ambersons  touch of evil  the trial  and chimes at midnight . the plot can tend to be confusing sometimes  and sometimes it seems to be moving maybe a tiny bit too fast  about an hour of it was edited out when test screenings went poorly  . it doesn  t matter  however . you can  t watch welles  films and manage to concentrate too much on the plot . his direction defines what great direction is . almost any scene from this film can hold up with any other scene he directed . check out the courtroom scene . usually they are such stock scenes that i can  t stand them . case in point  try to sit through welles  own speech near the end of compulsion . in lady from shanghai  just pay attention to the level of detail in that courtroom scene . watch that juror who is always sneezing and interrupting the proceedings . or just take a look at the lighting in that scene . i know  it is just a simple venetian blind  and that it was used constantly in film noirs and crime films of the era  but welles gives it a beauty all its own . the dialogue is also remarkable . welles had the skill  a skill that no one else seemed to have  to make a crime film containing examples of the grandest poetry . whether he was speaking shakespeare or spitting out hard  boiled lines  it had the power to stir the soul .      .  ,1
speaking solely as a movie  i didn  t really liked it . not because there were no fx or because we had a single cabin as the scenario for the whole film  actually that was what kept me watching it .  br    br   i didn  t like it because the acting was shady  his  friends  are all happy and then they  re mad  but you have no idea why then they take distinct roles  one is the believer  other is the antagonist  but they never really make the point  also  the lighting was terrible and i  m just mentioning technical issues .  br    br   in a few words  i thing the movie could have just had a  ok i  m outta here   from some characters . like the lady who doesn  t want to hear his version of the bible .  br    br   about the story itself  everyone is free to write about what they want  and the story is proof of some good writing and imagination . i credit the book author for that  hence  my     .  br    br   so  in the end  hear the man  s story believe it or not  just don  t spend the whole time acting like you believe him and being shocked at what he says  and at the same time moving around and making jokes like you don  t believe him .  br    br   coherence .  br    br   thanks for reading    ,0
unfortunately the movie is more concerned with making lame social commentary on a real event  but doesnt have the balls to legitimately document what happened . the constant rhetoric of how violent video games are not to blame  i get the impression ben coccio is an avid gamer   or how media and music is completely devoid of influence is the obvious message  we even get a laughable scene of the two boys burning all their cd  s  talk about subtlety    but the movie only gets away with it because its  fiction  . nice try . yes its a great idea to relieve media of influence  but how do we know the kids that have actually planned and executed a school shooting werent influenced by media  or video games  we dont  and we wont with this movie because once again these kids are smart enough to completely relinquish the media  yet dumb enough to scorch a nazi symbol on the ground  haha i somehow dont think so .  br    br   the movie bats you over the head with its portrayal of the normalcy of the families  its almost doing a disservice to think that there wasn  t a serious flaw in the family dynamic of kids that have actually gone out and shot their fellow schoolmates . why is everyone so concerned with making killers seem  normal   when they are so obviously not  a completely false and phony depiction .  ,0
now  i haven  t read the original short story to know all the literary points that went wrong here  so i  m not going to go down that path here .  br    br   but i have some time ago learnt that stephen king movies simply  are not  horror films  with perhaps a couple of exceptions . this was not one of them . it started well enough  and for once i  m not going to complain about the acting  although fred gwynne was as usual wonderful . . also i will forgive the total lack of parenting skills  as they were necessary to make the story here move forward . . .  br    br   but there was one consistent point that i couldn  t help but get annoyed with . and that came pretty close to the end of the movie  and at least  characters partook in the activity of dumb stupidity . the moments i refer to are thus there is a tiny zombie running around the house . you suspect it is under the bed . do you  br    br    a  get as close to the bed as you can before blindly raising the duvet cover up  exposing pretty much your whole body to whatever damage such a teeny undead cannibal might inflict on you  or  br    br    b  move a little away from the bed so you can peer under the completely open end from a position of slightly increased safety  or at least see the mini terror coming at you  giving you a little reaction time .  br    br   i know  let  s go with  a  . i feel like offering myself up for the slaughter today . bleh  br    br   fun enough film though . . . just not very scary .  ,0
hood of the living dead is about a young scientist named rick who lives with his brother in the town of oklahoma where drug dealers and prostitutes fill the streets . then one night  rick  s brother gets shot by a gang driving down the street who fought with him earlier . desperate  rick calls his scientist partner to bring over the latest formula they  ve been working on that brings sick blood cells to health . the formula hasn  t been tested on a human  or even a dead body but rick is determined to bring his brother back to life . he gives the body a double dose of the formula but nothing happens . so rick calls    and the body is carted away only for it to come back to life and feast on human flesh . now rick must find his zombie brother before the whole hood is transformed into a neighborhood of the dead . hood of the living dead is one piece of trash . the plot is a direct rip off of resident evil  the acting is just horrible especially with rick  s fake crying for his brother  the guns are so fake because every time the weapon is fired it sends sparks out  and the make up is just lame . it  s only fake blood covered over the actors face . the zombies are also modified . they run  growl  and must be shot in the heart to die  zombies should only scuffle  moan  and must be shot in the brain to die  this film is so horrible  the outtakes is the only true good moment of this film . hood of the living dead gets a  out of    a little entertainment here and there but it only succeeds as a low budget cringe fest .  ,0
this movie doesn  t even deserve a one . this was an utter waste of time . it was a waste of film and money . it was not offensive but everything was provocative and disgusting . my spoiler is one that i think should be read by everyone . there is full frontal nudity and disgusting language . but not only that  there is no plot line  the actors are terrible  the accents are horrible  the actors are small time and i was even excited to watch this movie   br    br   the only reason i rented it was for brian van holt  who got only a fifteen second part  by the way  . i think this might have been a mistake on the directors and editors parts but they repeated the same segments two or three times  adding only a new sentence .  br    br   a film similar to this is eraser head  possibly the most disturbing movie in existence . there is no plot line  and is not funny . although it isn  t trying to be funny . do not watch either movie .  ,0

bollywood fans pretty much hold amitabh bachan  s mard in high regard but i think it is very overrated . manmohan desai collaborated before on movies like suhaag  parvarish  amar akbar anthony  naseeb  desh premee and coolie and i have seen all of them i liked so i had very high expectations before i watched mard and was bitterly disappointed . my main gripe about mard is that it feels like amar akbar anthony part   maybe mr desai ran out of ideas  after all he had been using that formula for years and years .  . first of all some members of the cast is repeated from aaa  for instance the police inspector who brings up amar  the muslim who brings up akbar  nirupa roy and a few more .  . in aaa nirupa roy loses her eyesight  in mard she loses her voice  . in aaa there is the famous song  shirdi wale sai baba  well in mard we have amitabh singing maa sherawali . having seen aaa for over     times i noticed that straight away .  br    br   my other gripes are that some of the situations just seem ridiculous  true manmohan desai made leave your brain at the door kind of movies but with mard i thought he went too far . my last gripe is that compared to songs in previous manmohan desai movies i found the songs rather disappointing . i know it has many fans that swear by it but i didn  t like it one bit . it actually pains me to write this review because i am such a huge fan and have loved his movies since i was a child .  ,0
scary movie  was a grave disappointment . simply referencing movies  like mission impossible  does not lead to comedy . the movie opens well enough with a funny white people rapping scene and an excellent use of james woods ands andy richter . the movie plummets from there unfortunately . the acting is awful . tori spelling looks and acts completely out of place . the movie looks hacked together and is surprisingly slow paced . some of the longer gags in this snail paced movie  involving joints and a previously mentioned tom cruise movie  werent funny to anyone in my theater . the movie  thankfully  comes screeching to a halt at   minutes in a shockingly unfunny ending .  i say shocking because the ending does not even attempt to end with humor  i dont know what else to say except that is a sloppy rushed sequel done to make miramax some more cash on the backs of dumb teenagers . overall  a very poorly done movie .  ,0
this is pretty much the first jason scott lee film i  ve seen . i say pretty much  because i have also seen soldier  in which he plays the villain . . . but from what i  ve heard  it  s not considered a jason scott lee film . this  however  is . and if this is any indication of the quality of such films  i won  t be seeing any of the others . lee is basically passable as a martial arts artist . . . as the lead  he  s awful . he gets in a fight with random no  name characters every few minutes of the film  probably because the script writer couldn  t figure out how else to stretch out the film to the minimum required running time for a feature film . the villain is the only character with even a hint of personality  and aside from the fact that he  s certifiably insane  he barely seems like a villain at all . the majority of the film is basically lee chasing the villain through time . . . or maybe it  s the other way around . i can  t say for sure . . . and i definitely wouldn  t watch it again to make sure . the effects are not completely horrible . . . but it  s close . the title comes from the popular idea of using a time  machine to go and kill hitler . somehow  the film screws up that interesting idea as well . the plot is too complicated for its own good . the pacing is poor . i can  t think of one positive thing to say about this film . . . i really can  t . it  s simply too formulaic and pointless . if only i had a time  machine  so i could go back and prevent this film from ever being made . . . no  never mind . i just hope as few fragile minds are exposed to this as possible . listen to the negative reviewers . avoid this turkey . i recommend this to fans of lee  and no one else . if you  re looking for a quality film . . . well  this isn  t it . that  s for sure .      ,0
gender bender sexes things up a bit for the x  files . this episode has an interesting premise  a good story  but an ending that is wanting . gender bender is also the x  files debut for actor nicholas lea  better known as alex krycek . in this episode he plays michael  a man attacked by one of  the kindred  . you need to see this episode just to see nic lea  s less than spectacular beginning . an interesting thing about the kindred  s  power of seduction  . when marty does it to his victims  they become turned onto him  her . however  when andrew seduces scully  she only because disoriented and groggy  and does not become attracted to andrew . maybe it  s because marty has more experience at it than andrew . this episode reminds me of why it would sometimes be miserable to film up in british columbia . throughout the episode it is so wet  soggy  and muddy  it could not have been that much fun . despite the disappointing ending  gender bender is still a decent episode to view .  ,1
to put it simply  the fan was a disappointment . it felt like as if i was watching taxi driver  except taxi driver was much better than this . it seemed like the filmmakers wanted us to root for robert deniro  s character    percent . this approach didn  t work .  ,0
not that i dislike childrens movies  but this was a tearjerker with few redeeming qualities . m . j . fox was the perfect voice for stuart and the rest of the talent was wasted . hugh laurie can be amazingly funny  but is not given the chance in this movie . its sugar  coated sugar and would hardly appeal to anyone over  years of age . see toy story  monsters inc . or shrek instead .      ,0
most of the atomic age monster movies i saw on television as a kid  and some of them  the blob included  scared the daylights outta me . movies like invaders from mars made it all too clear to us  small fry  that kids just weren  t to be trusted when it came to things like things invading the homeworld the blob just reiterated that fact . i recall  fondly  late evenings spent stretched on the floor watching as body snatchers and martian invaders and blobs seeped into an unsuspecting society . there was a summer  in the early     s  when a local science museum  in richmond  virginia  ran an atomic age classic every weekend . these were   mm films  and most were black and white  and the projector was noisy   and the  color  print of the blob had faded to a faint pink  but  man  was it fun . i dragged my mother along  and she enjoyed it as much as i did . it was there  at that science museum  that i truly fell in love with the blob . the filmmaker  s intent was  of course  to make money  but it was the sincerity of all involved  from the filmmakers to the  talent   the players   that made me fall in love with this movie . corny  you bet . cheesy  they don  t get any cheesier . but  man  what a movie   ,1
  stories of the century  was a half hour series and appeared in first run syndication during the        television season . it was also the first western tv series to win an emmy award . starring veteran western actor jim davis as railroad detective matt clark  the series set clark and his fellow railroad detective partners  mary castle as frankie adams for the first half of the season and kristine miller as  jonesy  during the second half  against historic western outlaws of various periods ranging from the mid       s to the early      s . the series was very satisfying  easy to watch  and fairly realistic due mainly to the easygoing charm of jim davis in the lead role . he seemed like an actual western character . one other note . when matt clark would arrive in town after a long ride he actually looked like he had been on a long horse ride as he would be covered in dust .  br    br   a very good early adult western .  ,1
after reading the comments to this movie and seeing the mixed reviews  i decided that i would add my ten cents worth to say i thought the film was excellent  not only in the visual beauty  the writing  music score  acting  and directing  but in putting across the story of joseph smith and the road he traveled through life of hardship and persecution for believing in god the way he felt and knew to be his path . i am very pleased  indeed  to have had a small part in telling the story of this remarkable man . i recommend everyone to see this when the opportunity presents itself  no matter what religious path he or she may be walking  this only instills one with more determination to live the life that we should with true values of love and forgiveness as the savior taught us to do .  ,1
i can  t believe currently this movie is rated a  .  . anyway this movie was probably one of the most touching real indian movies i have ever seen . it was really refreshing to see a movie that showed traditional family cinema . as for the story i thought it was great it was about shahid kapur being set up on an arranged marriage with amrita rao . he is kind of a happy go lucky kind of guy  while amrita rao is a traditional indian girl who is very helpful to her uncle but the only problem is her cousin doesn  t seem to get as much attention as she does so her aunt dislikes amrita with a passion . this upsets amrita because she just wants her aunt to love her . it was also very touching to see that although amrita  s family wasn  t that rich maybe just middle class to lower class  while shahids family was quite upper class  they still treated their family with respect and didn  t even ask put them down which really struck a nerve with me . this is because i  ve actually seen people being very rude to people who are not as well of thinking their below their standards which i feel is very shallow . this movie showed that shahids family was willing to look at the great values that amrita had been brought up with and turned a blind eye to the fact she wasn  t a rich business tycoons daughter or anything . all in all this movie deserved an     i wish more and more of these kind of movies were made .  ,1
a river runs through it is one of those movies that deserves to be seen in the theater so that the majesty of its cinematography can be truly appreciated . the acting is wonderful and understated  with every gesture and smile and nod carrying meaning . brad pitt gives a radiant performance and tom skerrit is powerful as the preacher father . the movie moves like a river  you have to be willing to follow it through ebbs and flows  but it is well worth it in the end .  ,1
okay  i  ve tried and i  ve tried  but i still don  t get this guy maddin thing . tales from the gimli hospital left me cold  that movie about the austrian villagers and the one about the ice nymph were pretty to look but lacking in the story department . . . and this nudie movie about abortion and hockey is just boring . i  m glad maddin has an appreciation for silent film  but i dislike his films for the same reason i dislike the films of quentin tarantino they  re empty homages to better  more imaginative films   films that advanced the art form or broke new ground   and are all style and no substance . no amount of jump cuts and odd camera angles can disguise the fact that maddin is an unoriginal david lynch wannabe  though he does have one advantage over tarantino he generally doesn  t write embarrassing dialogue  because most of his films rely on intertitles . the bottom line is  maddin  s schtick is clever clever film  making for aspiring film majors .  ,0
this film is absolutely hilarious . basically  the plot revolves around a serial killer being somehow turned into a snowman through some b  movie chemical accident . he then heads for town and starts terrorising the locals . its up to the local police chief and some other characters to try and stop him . its made on a wee budget and it certainly shows  but the great thing about this film is it knows that its rubbish . the improvisations of styrofoam and polystyrene mimicking the giant killer snowman are classic  and this is clearly the intention  its one of the few films that has its budget as its main selling point . alongside the comic tackiness there are some other great comedy moments  listen out right in the beginning for the voice over of a dad scaring his kids to death  and the funniest rape scene ever committed to film . fantastic tacky fun  ,1
having enjoyed joyce  s complex novel so keenly i was prepared to be disappointed by joseph strick  s and fred haines  s screenplay  given the fabulous complexity of the original text . however  the film turned out to be very well done and a fine translation of the tone  naturalism  and levity of the book .  br    br   it certainly helps to have read the original text before viewing the film . i imagine the latter would seem disjointed  with very odd episodes apparently randomly stitched together  without a prior reading of the text to help grasp the plot .  br    br   it  s amazing to see how  filthy  the film is  given that it was shot in dublin in     . the irish film censors only  finally  unbanned it for viewing by general audiences in ireland as late as      it was shown to restricted audiences in a private cinema club  the irish film theatre  in the late     s  . joyce  s eroticism is not simply naturalistic and raunchy  it offers many wildly  perverse  episodes . never mind that so many of these fetishes were unacceptable when the book was published in      they were still utterly taboo when the film was made in     .  br    br   it is astonishing and heartening to watch the cream of the irish acting profession of the     s  respected players all  daring to utter and enact joyce  s hugely transgressive text with such gusto .  br    br   bravo   ,1
i just saw this recently  after an interval of nearly forty years . it holds up well  especially lionel bart  s outstanding songs .   who will buy  with it  s magical counterpoint  just one of many standouts .   br    br   i disagree with the other post that decried its g rating . the ratings system  brand new at the time  never intended the g  general  rating to mean  completely devoid of conflict  .  br    br   characterizing it as unsuitable for kids reminds me of the description i once saw of the wizard of oz a girl arrives in a strange land and kills the first person she encounters . she then goes on a road trip with three male companions and kills again .  ,1
heather graham couldn  t play a convincing lesbian if her life depended on it . who do the producers of the movie think they are  the absolute worst  most unrealistic movie i  ve seen in as long as i can remember . this movie is so bad that i felt compelled to sign  up on imdb and make sure the rating of this  film  drops .  br    br   omg i  m heather graham  i just kissed a drunk chick  so while she  s passed out i  m really going to pace around my room for hours asking myself frantically  what have i done    . . jesus heather  get over it and grow up . . . and i  d like to forward that same sentiment to the idiot producers . . . and while i  m at it  instead of this movie being all about an pathetic excuse for a coming out story  perhaps it would have been more suitable to focus the plot onto a character who  s mentally unstable . . . like your so  called  lesbian  character . . . after all  i know the first time i had gay sex  when i left the next morning i jumped to the sky in excitement in the middle of the street . . . honestly btch  get a grip . . .  br    br   what a joke  and please note there are many many many more flaws and appallingly stupid aspects to this lame flick  but i  m so sick of even thinking about it anymore . bottom line  if you  re a smart person you  ll hate this movie  and if you  re not a smart person  then you  ll love it . . . it  s as simple as that .  ,0
now  i  m no film critic  but i truly hated  september    . this film was  on a general basis  bad . with the exception of alejandro gonzlez irritu  s segment  which was the most effective and direct about the subject matter  the short films were at best boring  and at worst offensive . the worst in my mind was youssef chahine  s pretentious segment in which he compared palestinian suicide bombers to american soldiers  even going so far as to suggest the suicide bombers were fighting for a greater cause . the segment was completely off topic and  considering chahine  s seeming lack of any decency whatsoever  a waste of my time and patience . the idea of getting eleven different directors from different countries to make a movie featuring their views on a tragedy was good on paper  but in practice  it was tasteless .  ,0
the summer has been so full of blockbusters and comebacks of films  and not to mention some of the disappointments of those comebacks  that i was woe to find a film i could just sit down and enjoy .  br    br   in case you don  t want to read further down the page  there aren  t any spoilers   i  ll sum it up here it  s more mature than ella enchanted  there are some questionably violent parts  plenty of death  and a handful of scenes with a little blood  not for small children   but doesn  t try to be overly corny or overstep its bounds . think of it as a bit more serious  bit more magical princess bride  and you  ll be close .  br    br                                                                 br    br   i am  perhaps  not as prodigious a movie goer as others . . . maybe once or twice a month  if i feel active . i  m also a huge sci  fi  fantasy fan . i get bored of remade repetitive story lines and films with more flash than filling faster than you can count to    and this film is the diamond in the rough .  br    br   by the end here  august   i was tired enough of fractured expectations from the big hits that i averted seeing bourne ultimatum in favor of stardust . having had my hopes thoroughly muddied by transformers for my fiction addiction  the previews of stardust seemed appealing  but i was certainly wary .  br    br   as many others here  i was utterly surprised . i had gone in thinking to see another generic fantasy movie clichd from here to breakfast . don  t be fooled  it is most definitely a fairy  tale  and it does indeed have witches  magic  and utterly requires suspension of disbelief . . . but the most refreshing thing i found  is that it  s not based on anything i  ve seen or read in the past   years  and it  s actually a really good movie .  br    br     unlike    of the other movies which seem to persistently re  appear like thorns in a side  perhaps a sign that hollywood is running out of ideas  i could read a book this year  and in two years the movie would be out as another  epic fantasy tale  the likes of lotr and the rest  so says the nyt and such and such no doubt .    br    br   stardust didn  t have me bolted to my seat because of jam  packed action at every turn  nor was i sweating bullets because of plot  hook after plot  hook threatening to tear the dramatic tension apart and echo throughout the theater in a loud boom . it didn  t even use enormous blasts of sound to grab my attention to what  s happening on screen  transformers  i  m looking at you  . it  s not trying to show off the latest cgi techniques  nor did it offend my intelligence with dimwitted dialogs and story lines that are simple enough i could  ve figured them out in  rd grade  boy i hate those  .  br    br   i just . . . watched . watched  and enjoyed a refreshingly creative storyline unfold before my eyes . sure  i may have known what was going to happen throughout most of the film  but it makes you forget that . it even made my heart twinge at some parts  but the most important aspect i noticed is that i left the theater feeling better than when i  d gone in .  br    br   it truly is a gem . after so much slush this summer with so many remakes and films that fell short of my expectations  this was like a cold sweet cup of tea to cap off all the hard work i  d done sitting through the others trying to come out of them with my money  s worth .  br    br   it  s probably not for everyone  but do yourself a favor if you enjoy fantasy films that stand the test of time alone  princess bride  black cauldron  the dark crystal  etc .  then you should really see this movie . this little diamond is finding its way into my dvd collection the moment it hits stores  you can trust me on this .  br    br   simply wonderful .  ,1
it  s been a long time since i saw this mini  series and i am happy to say its remembered merits have withstood the test of time .  br    br   most of the components of  a perfect spy   the adaptation of lecarr  s finest novel  in my opinion  are top  drawer . outstanding aspects of it are the musical score and the masterful screenplay  the latter written by arthur hopcraft who was also  i believe  the screenwriter for  tinker tailor soldier spy  with alec guinness a few years before .  br    br   the actors are mostly very good  some superb  like alan howard  s jack brotherhood and ray mcanally  s ricky pym . peter egan is fascinating to watch because his face changes with every camera angle . the passage of time and the effects upon the physical appearances of the characters is very believably done . so much so that i wondered exactly how old peter egan was at the time of filming . the only jolt comes after the character of magnus pym is transferred from the very able hands of a young actor named benedict taylor to those of a noticeably too  old peter egan  just fresh out of oxford . but this is a minor and unimportant seam in the whole .  br    br   egan has trouble being convincing only when the text becomes melodramatic and he needs to be  upset  emotionally  ie cry . none of the actors have a very easy time with these moments  aside from the wonderful frances tomelty who plays peggy wentworth for all she  s worth and steals the episode with ease .  br    br   jane booker is annoying as mary pym . she has part of the character under her skin but often displays an amateurish petulance that diminishes her as a tough cookie diplomatic housewife  which mary pym is . rdiger weigang is splendid as axel  amusing  ironic and brilliant . i also enjoyed sarah badel  s camp turn as the baroness .  br    br   the british view of americans is vividly rendered in some dryly hilarious scenes . when the yanks have come abroad to confab with bo brammell  head of mi   the american contingent are portrayed as empty  headed buffoons who appear to have memorized a lot of long words out of the dictionary and spiced them liberally with american jargon and psycho babble  much to the bemused scorn of the english .  br    br   the humor and sadness are subtly blended . lecarr has a knack for mixing disparate elements in his stories and hopcraft has brilliantly captured the melancholy  yet wistful  atmosphere of the original .  br    br   not a perfect production  what is   and yet the best of the lecarr adaptations to reach film or television to date .  br    br   highly recommended to all spy  thriller lovers and especially lecarr fans . dvd available from acorn .  ,1
if you are a crispin glover fan  you must see this . if you are a sean penn fan  you must see this . if you are a movie fan in general  you must see this . if you have no idea who crispin glover is and you have no idea who sean penn is  this film will probably still have a lot of value  but the more work you  ve previously seen by crispin or sean  the better .  br    br   this movie is so funny  but it is also pure genius . there is nothing that i know of that resembles this film . it is its own genre . i doubt that anything like it will ever be made again . i cannot say anything more about exactly why without partially spoiling it  and some of the other reviews here have already done a good job at doing that .  br    br   in response to any of the reviewers here that gave it a bad review  i ask that you view the film again . in reality  there is no point at which this film could fairly be called  boring .  this is possibly the funniest  most entertaining  and least boring film ever made . and it only gets better with age and repeated viewings . a timeless classic that  unfortunately  very few will be able to claim to have seen .  br    br   beaver trilogy is the brilliant work of director trent harris  also responsible for the amazing rubin and ed  which crispin glover also stars in .  br    br   unfortunately  copies of this film are rare and hard to find . i managed to find a vhs version after some diligent searching though  and there are a couple of ways to find it that i know of . but i really wish someone would put this onto a dvd .  ,1
scary  but mostly in the sense that will it be over before i turn   . i saw this as a late night re  run in about     and thought it would never end . like crackers  it  s better than nothing  but just  .  br    br   ray milland is a little scary because he looks as if he  s been stuffed by a taxidermist . yvette mimeux looks as if she  s smoked up all the beautiful downtown burbank brown .  br    br   it  s a sort of roy rogers version of rosemary  s baby . this is one turkey that should never have been made . if you have insomnia and it  s     on saturday morning and there  s nothing on but replays of the     roller derby chamionship  then i guess it beats that . but god help you if this is your only choice for entertainment .  ,0
i saw this series when it world premiered at the toronto film festival . i liked the idea behind the film  where two men got together and told a director from each country to direct a movie about    . these directors never met before until the project was complete  and they saw how it looked all together . warning spoilers ahead                       all the pieces were very powerful  and some were controversial . if you are an american  then you may not like this as some of the pieces may be found anti  american . however  i know a few americans who enjoyed these series . the piece that i found the best was the one from india . it was about how a muslim family  living in the states  had  sons  and one of them was missing . the americans gave them the cold shoulder and automatically assumed that he was linked with the terrorist bombing . it captures the mom  s despair and humiliation of these accusations so well  that it brought tears to my eyes . in the end we see that her son had died while trying to save the many victims from the crash of the towers . this was a true story  and that was what made it so real . there were a lot of emotional and powerful pieces  and the african piece was one of the best . it was humourous yet just as powerful as the others . a must see for everyone  and hopefully america will unban this  and let it play in their country .  ,1
i find it sad that christians  and i am one  feel that we must make movies like  left behind .  we have much better stories to tell that don  t have to be so preachy . i was very disappointed with this film . as an aspiring filmmaker who believes in christ  i see this film as the perfect example for what i am not going to do with my career in film .  ,0
not that i want to be mean but this movie really surprised me a lot . during the whole film  i was like . . . erm . . . what is this movie all about  i don  t get the animations at all . probably this movie will only be suitable for those who belongs to the     s . during the film  there is a group of people walked out . after the movie  many people said   that  s it   frankly speaking  i cannot believe that this movie was awarded the best children film award . if you are thinking of watching this film  i strongly recommend you not to . you will regret it . i  m not joking . you will find that you are just wasting both your time and money of you go and watch it .  ,0
the only reason i rented this was because of the article in fangoria magazine . the article made this film look interesting . well  it isn  t . this was a very boring  amateurishly written and directed movie . all the actors in this movie are awful  except faye dunaway  who is always a joy to watch . but too much time was focused on gina phillips and her ridiculous encounters with ravens and duilio marzio . marzio has such a thick argentinean accent  you can only understand every couple of words he says . also on hand is nicholas pauls  who plays the ultra  bland love interest to gina phillips . the bottom line this movie is not scary . there is only one good scene and that is the last five to ten minutes of the movie . i would have given this one star  but i gave it three just because i like faye dunaway so much . but even she wasn  t that great in this .  ,0
i think dolph lundgren had potential at being a big action star a la schwarzenegger  stallone  and even van damme to certain degree . he had some big moments in his career but he also made some poor choices and this is definitely one of them although made later in his career . the strange thing about jill the ripper  or jill rips . . . or tied up  is that i honestly think they seriously thought they were making a provocative and serious thriller  it shows in the way that they describe it on imdb  on the dvd case  in the commentaries  and this film is not serious . to call it campy would be a huge understatement . the film tries to be complex and intelligent when in fact it  s nothing more than shallow  confusing and gratuitous . on top of that they put lundgren  who is known for action films  in an attempt at a serious role which makes it even more campy because his range as an actor is pretty limited . the entire film revolves around the kinky sex world and yet they attempt at making it a serious thriller  just the plot and premise immediately make it a b  movie porn at very best .  br    br   dolph lundgren plays disgraced former cop and raging alcoholic matt sorenson who decides to play detective when his brother is murdered . i mean put aside the numerous plot holes that has lundgren getting free roam to investigate crime scenes  and witnesses and everything else even though he  s not a cop anymore and you still have a pretty strange and rather lack luster performance from lundgren . danielle brett is lundgren  s eventual love interest and his brother  s widow . brett plays her role decently enough considering the script and campy story . the supporting cast is huge and no one particularly stands out in their performances unless it  s on the negative side such as the absolutely horrible performance by victor pedtrchenko who seems to go by several different names in the film  boasts an awful accent and is a really awful villain .  br    br   i honestly tried to get into the mystery and film and watch closely but there wasn  t any reason to because it was all a jumble of ridiculous plot and gratuitous sex games including a downright ridiculously hilarious scene where lundgren goes under cover and is strung upside down nearly naked . to explain how classy and well done this movie is  sarcasm . . . sarcasm  the back of the dvd i picked up  it was really cheap  has lundgren  s character listed as  murray wilson   not the name of his character in the film .  while somehow lundgren manages to be usually watchable the film falls flat on it  s face trying to be serious . considering director anthony hickox is infamous for really b  movie horror flicks it only makes sense even though i think he was really trying to be serious . hard core cult lundgren fans will have to see it . . . no one else should . . . certainly for any sort of mystery or suspense .      ,0
although in many ways i agree with the other reviewers comments . i find that the plot and idea are very good . many of the supporting actors were very good . the fatal problem with this film is ellen pompeo . i am sure  i have never seen a less talented  actor  how this person has ever been in a film or on television  i cannot imagine . in my opinion she would be better as a greater at a wal  mart . to see a person with this low level of talent involved in paying roles  does beg the question . . . . . .  who does she know   i would very much like to see this film re  made with some talent . i do not fault the writer for the failure of this film to be worth the time to view it .  ,0
ironically the most talked  about american film in the     new york film festival is    in spanish . the extra  long film  s controversy began at the cannes festival . there were love  hate notices  and considerable doubts about commercial prospects . as consolation the star  benicio del toro  got the best actor award there . i  m talking about steven soderbergh  s  che   of course . that  s the name it  s going by in this version  shown in new york as at cannes in two   hour  plus segments without opening title or end credits .  che  is certainly appropriate since ernesto  che  guevara is in almost every scene . del toro is impressive  hanging in reliably through thick and thin  from days of glorious victory in part one to months of humiliating defeat in part two  appealing and simpatico in all his varied manifestations  even disguised as a bald graying man to sneak into bolivia . it  s a terrific performance one wishes it had a better setting .  br    br   if you are patient enough to sit through the over four hours  with an intermission between the two sections  there are rewards . there  s an authentic feel throughout   fortunately soderbergh made the decision to film in spanish  though some of the actors  oddly enough in the english segments especially  are wooden  . you get a good outline of what guerrilla warfare  che style  was like the teaching  the recruitment of campesinos  the morality  the discipline  the hardship  and the fighting   as well as che  s gradual morphing from company doctor to full  fledged military leader . use of a new   pound   mm  quality red  digital high performance cine camera  that just became available in time for filming enabled dp peter andrews and his crew to produce images that are a bit cold  but at times still sing  and are always sharp and smooth .  br    br   the film is in two parts   soderbergh is calling them two  films   and the plan is to release them commercially as such . first is  the argentine   depicting che  s leadership in jungle and town fighting that led up to the fall of havana in the late    s  and the second is  guerrilla   and concerns che  s failed effort nearly a decade later in bolivia to spearhead a revolution  a fruitful mission that led to guevara  s capture and execution in     . the second part was to have been the original film and was written first and  i think  shot first . producer laura bickford says that part two is more of a thriller  while part one is more of an action film with big battle scenes . yes  but both parts have a lot in common   too much   since both spend a large part of their time following the guerrillas through rough country . guerrilla an unmitigated downer since the bolivian revolt was doomed from the start . the group of cubans who tried to lead it didn  t get a friendly reception from the bolivian campesinos  who suspected foreigners  and thought of the cuban communists as godless rapists . there is a third part  a kind of celebratory black and white interval made up of che  s speech at the united nations in     and interviews with him at that time  but that is inter  cut in the first segment . the first part also has fidel and is considerably more upbeat  leading as it does to the victory in santa clara in     that led to the fall of the dictatorship of fulgencio batista in cuba .  br    br   during  guerilla  i kept thinking how this could indeed work as a quality european  style miniseries  which might begin with a shortened version of walter salles  s  motorcycle diaries  and go on to take us to guevara  s fateful meeting with fidel in mexico and enlistment in the   th of july movement . there could be much more about his extensive travels and diplomatic missions . this is far from a complete picture of the man  his childhood interest in chess  his lifelong interest in poetry  the books he wrote even his international fame is only touched on . and what about his harsh  cruel side  really what soderbergh is most interested in isn  t che  but revolution  and guerrilla warfare . the lasting impression that the   hours leave is of slogging through woods and jungle with wounded and sick men and women and idealistic dedication to a the cause of ending the tyranny of the rich . someone mentioned being reminded of terrence malick  s  the tin red line   and yes  the meandering  episodic battle approach is similar but  the thin red line  has stronger characters  hardly anybody emerges forcefully besides che   and it  s a really good film . this is an impressive  but unfinished and ill  fated  effort .  br    br   this   years  gestating  heavily researched labor of love  how many more ocean  s must come to pay for it   is a vanity project  too long for a regular theatrical release and too short for a miniseries . radical editing   or major expansion   would have made it into something more successful  and as it is it  s a long slog  especially in the second half .  br    br   it  s clear that this slogging could have been trimmed down  though it  s not so clear what form the resulting film would have taken   but with a little bit of luck it might have been quite a good one .

the ship may have sunk but the movie didn  t    director  james cameron  from  the terminator  did it again with this amazing picture . one of my favorite scenes is  the dinner table  scene  in which rose  s family and friends meet jack after he saves her . rose has a look on her face that every woman should have when you meet  the one  . . . i hope i have that look when i am in the room with my future husband .  br    br   jack and rose have a connection that is  movie stuff  but it  s good movie stuff . we have the greedy mom and all her elite stuck up associates who live off of their husbands wealth . rose almost commits suicide but the gilbert grape star rescues her . i really liked the hanging over the boat scene . it was a good risk .  br    br   the movie is long but it  s fantastic    good story  good flow  good actors    go see it twice if you want  its worth it     ,1
warning mild spoilers .  br    br   the story of joseph smith stands out as an amazing  even moving  episode in american history and world religious history . this movie portrays events in the life of joseph smith  whom mormons revere as the prophet of the restoration of the true church of jesus christ on the earth . i  ve so far seen the movie twice in its first month of public showing .  br    br   joseph smith is shown first to be the youngest of a trio of brothers  alvin  hyrum  joseph  who  at a very young age  needed an operation . the operation  done without our modern conveniences  was bloody and difficult . the scene helped to show the cohesiveness of the smith family and the bonds between the brothers and between joseph and his parents .  br    br   joseph  s religious confusion and subsequent praying which lead to what mormons call the first vision was interestingly portrayed . the face of jesus is never shown  but you see the unmistakable nail marks in his hands . the rejection by religious leaders and many in his small new york community is sweetened at least slightly by joseph  s marriage to emma .  br    br   this movie does not clearly map out the events of mormon church history  but merely jumps from scene to scene . this is not a critique  simply a note about the style .  br    br   the practice of tarring and feathering is shown  and it is especially dramatic and moving when joseph delivers a sermon about the savior  s love with a scarred face from having recently been attacked .  br    br   the movie masterfully portrays simultaneously the joy and growth of mormonism as an infant church  while at the same time the ever  deepening opposition that spread into the heights of local governments .  br    br   the film shows many scenes from joseph  s life  including a few beautiful moments portraying his relationship to emma . an attempt is made to show the depth and complexity of joseph  s life  including his fierce love for his wife  his endless love for children  his wit  his courage in the face of filthy and dangerous opposition  his religious sentiments  and his compassion .  br    br   as joseph and hyrum ride to carthage  never to return home alive  most of the characters from throughout the movie  whose lives had been touched by joseph  are shown along the way  helping to reinforce what was already seen but setting up the final scene to be more powerful .  br    br   at the end  the martyrdom of joseph and hyrum is portrayed  and moviegoers are left to ponder the events they just witnessed .  br    br   when i first watched the movie i assumed it was made by the church to introduce joseph smith to non  members . i no longer think that is the case  although i hope the movie can do just that . as an insider  i find that the film is a celebration of joseph and excellently reinforces the good things we already know about him . i am curious to see how outsiders will view the film  whether they will simply see it as propagandic  an epic story of an american religious man  or something else .  br    br   the film is beautifully shot  family friendly  moving and  hopefully  something good for everyone . that the events portrayed actually happened in these united states of america is interesting to ponder in light of the many aspects of our culture  including freedom of religious expression and respect  generally  for the law  we moderns take for granted .  ,1
as a  jane eyre  fan i was excited when this movie came out .  at last   i thought   someone will make this book into a movie following the story actually written by the author .  wrong    if the casting director was intending to cast a  jane  who was plain he certainly succeeded . however  surely he could have found one who could also act . where was the tension between jane and rochester  where was the spooky suspense of the novel when the laughter floated into the night seemingly from nowhere  where was the sparkle of the child who flirted and danced like her mother  finally  why was the plot changed at the end  one wonders whether the screenwriters had actually read the book . what a disappointment  ,0
huge ramones fan . i do like the ramones  and i suppose if you hate them  then  besides being a avid bush supporter  you might not like this classic .  br    br   it  s immensely better than the sappy john hughes teen films and the like that littered the    s . infinitely better than the american pie  s that plague us now .  br    br   there are some other great high school films switchblade sisters  fast times . . .  class of     three o  clock high  and the cheesy yet gripping  doesn  t seem possible  river  s edge . but rnrhs will always be my favorite because it  s the funniest and most fun  plus you can get up and dance with it .  br    br   i love you  riff randell .  br    br         ,1
i was one of the few non  liberals who showed up to see steve  s video . it was quite an experience . . . in propaganda film  making and boredom .  br    br   i was hoping the film might be an actual documentary of michael moore  s visit to my local school  uvsc  but it turned out to be another liberal  slash  and  burn effort to slam conservatives and the local religious community . it sure seems self  serving for a filmmaker to make a documentary that only reflects his preconceptions on issues .  br    br   what  s more surprising is to see all the     votes his homeys have posted here . did they even see the video  golly gee batman  this must rank with all the president  s men  their ratings are as obvious as the bias in this film .  br    br   yeah  like stacking the votes at imdb will help a lame movie . maybe my vote will help balance this out .  ,0
the problem with  the killer elite  is that just by seeking this film out  and investing time to watch it  you are putting more effort into the experience than many of its principals did  particularly director sam peckinpah .  br    br   the already volatile peckinpah was heading into rough weather with this film . according to at least one biographer  this was where he became acquainted with cocaine . add to that his binge drinking  and it  s no wonder things fell apart .  br    br   it  s a shame  because the concept behind the film is a good one  and the first ten minutes promise much . mike locken  james caan  and george hansen  robert duvall  are private contractors who do a lot of dirty work for the cia . they move quick  live well  and seem like the best of friends  then something happens to shatter their brotherhood .  br    br   an opening scene shows them blowing up a building  why exactly we aren  t told  par for the course in terms of this film  s murky motivation . but the implication is these guys hurt people and don  t really care  antiheroes much like the wild bunch of peckinpah  s not  so  long  ago . an opening title tells us they work for comteg  then adds with obvious tongue in cheek  . . . the thought the cia might employ such an organization for any purpose is  of course  preposterous .  that  s a pretty clever way of letting the audience know all bets are off .  br    br   add to that a traditionally strong peckinpah backup cast  including burt young  gig young  and peckinpah regular bo hopkins in the plum role of a madman who can  t pass up an opportunity to be shot at for     a day  and you only wish that the scriptwriters  including the celebrated sterling silliphant  tried to do something more with the story than turn it into a platform for lazy one  liners and bad chop  socky knockoffs . an attempt at injecting a dose of liberal social commentary is awkwardly shoehorned in .  you  re so busy doing their dirty work  you can  t tell who the bad guys are   someone tells locken  as if either he or we need it pointed out .  br    br   worse still are peckinpah  s clumsy direction and sluggish pacing . we  re   minutes into the film before we get our first battle scene  a completely chaotic collection of random shots where a bunch of people we haven  t even met before are seen fighting at san francisco airport  their battle intercut with a conversation in an office suite .  br    br   by the end of the film  what  s left of the cast is having a battle inside a fleet of mothballed victory ships  ninjas running out in the open to be gunned down while caan tosses off one liners that undercut any hint of real suspense .  lay me seven  to  five  i  ll take the little guy   he wisecracks just before a climatic samurai duel between two ninja warriors  from china  which we all know is the land of the ninja .  the battle takes place in san francisco  but surprisingly no mounties arrive to break things up .   br    br   caan is much better in smaller scenes  like when locken  recovering from some nasty injuries  is told by one of his bosses  played by a smooth arthur hill  that he  s been  humpty  dumped  by the organization . caan refuses to stay down  and his recovery scenes  though momentum  killing for the movie  feature fine acting from him and amy heflin  van  s daughter  as a supportive nurse . caan was one of the     s  best actors  and his laconic byplay with heflin  duvall  hopkins  and both youngs give  killer elite  real watchability .  br    br   but you don  t watch  killer elite  thinking about that . you watch it thinking of the film that got away .  ,0
in don siegel  s     masterpiece  dirty harry   clint eastwood epitomized the super  tough  super  cool unorthodox  no  nonsense cinema  cop with his role of the eponymous inspector  dirty  harry callahan . two sequels followed  the first of which   magnum force   tamed down on the delightfully politically incorrect attitude of the first one that had outraged many critics but enthused audiences . the second sequel   the enforcer  was grittier again  and was promoted as  the dirtiest harry of them all  . this title  however  truly belongs to the fourth film in the series  clint eastwood  s own  sudden impact   which is doubtlessly the grittiest  nastiest  most violent and downright dirtiest of all harry films  and  in my humble opinion  the second  best after the masterpiece original .  br    br   warning  spoilers ahead   in a small town near san francisco  a mysterious sexy lady  sondra locke  lures men into being alone with her . what these men don  t know is that mysterious beauty is their former rape victim  longing for bloody revenge . as fate wants it  san francisco  s toughest cop  inspector dirty harry callahan  who has been suspended once again for angering his superiors  spends his leisure time in this exact little town . . .  sudden impact  is the dirtiest callahan film in several aspects . the film is extremely gritty and graphically violent . harry callahan himself is dirtier than ever . not afraid to make use of his   . magnum in order to stop trouble  harry treats  punks  as they are to be treated and even allows a person to get away with several murders because the revenge  murders are justified in his opinion . clint eastwood is  as always  brilliant in the role of harry callahan . eastwood epitomized coolness and bad  assery as the  man with no name  in sergio leone  s dollar trilogy  and he did so again in the dirty harry films .  sudden impact  gives us the dirtiest harry we have ever seen . eastwood  s real  life girlfriend sondra locke fits very well in the role of the vengeful beauty . the great pat hingle  who had already worked with eastwood in ted post  s tough  minded western  hang  em high  in     plays the police chief of the small town . the film furthermore includes a wide range of truly despicable scumbag characters  including a pathetic criminal played by kevin major howard  best known for his role in stanley kubrick  s  full metal jacket   and a woman named ray perkins  audrie j . neenan   doubtlessly one of the most disgusting and despicable female characters ever in cinema . albert popwell  who played the bank robber in the famous  do you feel lucky   scene in  dirty harry  and the black militant leader in  the enforcer  is also part of this one again  this time as harry  s colleague and buddy . overall  sudden impact  is the grittiest  dirtiest and probably the most violent of all  dirty harry  films   though  the dead pool  isn  t exactly tame either   and my second  favorite after the brilliant     original . an absolute must  see for callahan fans  and highly recommended to all lovers of police thrillers and cinematic bad  assery . my rating  .      ,1
wow  here it finally is the action  movie  without action . in a real low  budget setting  don  t miss the hilarious flying saucers flying by a few times  of a future seattle we find a no  brain hardbody seeking to avenge her childhood .  br    br   there is nothing even remotely original or interesting about the plot and the actors  performance is only rivalled in stupidity by the attempts to steal from other movies  mainly  matrix  without having the money to do it right . yes  we do get to see some running on walls and slow motion shoot  outs    secs approx .  but these scenes are about as cool as the stupid hardbody  s attempts at making jokes about male incompetence now and then .  br    br   and  yes  we are also served a number of leads that lead absolutely nowhere  as if the script was thought  out by the previously unseen cast while shooting the scenes .  br    br   believe me  it is as bad as it possibly can get . in fact  it doesn  t deserve to be taken seriously  but perhaps i can make some of you not rent it and save your money .  ,0
if you want to see intelligent  philosophical discussion of human possibility and potential  watch  waking life   which is brilliant .  what the   do we know  is all over the place in its focus  poorly directed  poorly written  poorly acted  utterly devoid of any art direction and completely annoying . it wasn  t thought  provoking or entertaining in the slightest . the inclusion of that rambling freak  ramtha  in this film is reason enough to avoid it . isn  t it strange how the filmmakers choose to look over the fact that this woman worships some      year old atlantian god or something  what a flake that old chick is  and what a total waste of my time and money this movie was . the people responsible for this film should not be allowed to make another movie ever again .  ,0
this is a pleasant film  even if the premise is silly . it was sort of a guilty pleasure to watch . meg ryan seems to be able to pull off roles in this kind of film  another example is joe vs . the volcano  . that  s what makes her a star  in part . walter matthau  of course  had that ability  too  and he really puts himself into the role  making an amusing  good  hearted einstein . i suppose you could say they  re both good at portraying loveable characters  though loveable in different ways  loveable young women vs . loveable curmudgeon  .  ,1
this is an absurdist dark comedy from belgium . shot perfectly in crisp black and white  benot poelvoorde  man bites dog  is on fine form as roger  the angry  obsessive father of a family in a small  sullen belgian mining town . roger is a photographer who  along with his young daughter luise  visits road accidents to take photos . he is also obsessed with winning a car by entering a competition where the contestant has to break a record  and he decides that his son  michel  must attempt to break the record of perpetually walking through a door  he even hires an overweight coach to train him . michel dresses as elvis and has a spot on a radio show called  cinema lies   where he describes mistakes in films . luise is friendly with near neighbour felix  a pigeon fancier . roger is a callous figure as he pushes michel right over the limit during the record attempt  which almost results in his death . interspersed throughout the film are magritte  like surreal images . it  s undeniably charming and well worth your time .  ,1
  cry freedom  is not just a movie . it is a historical account  heroic story  and insight into the cultural background of a major event in history . not only does denzel washington do a terrific job of impersonating a motivating  determined hero  steve biko  but he delivers a message to the public about the horrors of south arfrican apartheid . the story of biko  an influential leader  and his main  influencee   donald woods  is a heartbreaking one . but  the ultimate success of his life can go beyond the atrocities committed in south africa .  cry freedom  manages to communicate to its audience the optimistic aspect of the seemingly disturbing plot . it is because of great films like this one  that the public can become educated on terrible events in history  great leaders who sought to end them  and how we can never allow them to happen in the future . because of this importance   cry freedom  is an amazing film that should be seen by all .  ,1
i saw this film on its release  and have watched it  or  more times  including last week . i regret i have to be a voice of dissension with regard to mr . branagh  s performance .  br    br   this is really a glorious  sumptuous film  to say nothing of ambitious at over  hours long  beautifully shot and designed . derek jacobi  julie christie  kate winslet  richard briers  and many others do fine jobs . then there  s kenneth branagh . if ever there was a vanity project for an actor  this is it  and mr . branagh spares nothing in putting the  ham  in hamlet . from the stunt casting  which gives us the worst performance ever by the woefully miscast jack lemmon   to the bits of distracting business thrown in to infuse a sense of  naturalness   to his own performance which runs the gamut from throwing away the single most famous soliloquy in all of literature to screaming every line of others . his performance confirms that  while he may come across better on stage where bigger is necessary  he has never been a great film actor . the scenery budget could be charged to catering  mr . branagh eats so much of it . his performance is a perfect example of why people don  t go to see shakespeare   full of sound and fury  signifying nothing .  and if there is fault to his direction  it is that he keeps the camera firmly glued on his overblown performance .  br    br   no matter what theories people may posit on the bard  he was  after all is said and done  a playwright . the brilliance of his plays rest in the fact that his themes are universal and timeless . although there is no  right  way to play his plays  there is most certainly great acting  good acting and bad acting . shakespeare himself gives instructions to the players in the text of  hamlet  itself . it amazes me how mr . branagh  mouthed  it  but did not hear it . it was an example of spending too much time working out how he  s going to say something  and too little figuring out what he  s saying .  br    br   while mr . branagh has certainly done a wonderful job in mounting some entertaining productions  he would be wise to stay behind the camera and allow those who know the art of acting to practice it . his direction has always been better than his acting . i still give him immense credit for resurrecting interest in filming shakespeare . he set a great template for other productions . and  it would be interesting to see him onstage  from about   rows back . but  i do hope he chooses to direct more and act less .  br    br   is it worth seeing  certainly . there are many little joys to be found in the film . but  it  s a long  long movie and  by the end  one may feel less that they enjoyed than survived it .  ,0
when i rented this i was hoping for what  reign of fire  did not deliver a clash between modern technology and mythic beasts .  br    br   instead i got a standard  monster hunts stupid people in remote building  flick  with bad script  bad music  bad effects  bad plot  bad acting . bad  bad  bad .  br    br   only reason why i did give it a  was that in theory there could exist worse movies . in theory . . . . .  ,0
as other reviewers have noted  this is an unjustly neglected depression  era film . directed by frank borzage  two oscars  and written by jo swerling  leave her to heaven  the westerner  lifeboat  etc .   it is a tough  minded  well  structured and  realized move about denizens of a new york city shantytown . they  re grifters  beggars  and women forced into prostitution  but they  re a community of people both good and bad  with loyalties as complex as any group  s .  br    br   perhaps primary among this movie  s many admirable qualities is the contrast between spencer tracy  s character  bill  and loretta young  s trina . he tough  talking  physically aggressive  and evidently fearless   but bill is not the character who gives this film its steely sense of survival . while he blusters  trina actually hangs tough  if that term can be applied to a character so ladylike  . her devotion to him is obvious  and complete . when she becomes pregnant  she says she will raise it herself if he wants to leave  or  i  ll even give up the kid if you  ll only be happy .  such is the dignity of loretta young  s performance  at age    as a quite simple character  that she seems neither weak or dependent  but rather a woman who recognizes happiness when she finds it  and wants nothing more .  ,1
i noticed this movie was getting trashed well before it hit the theaters and i too didn  t have high hopes for it . i figured it was another  you got served  type of movie with some nice dance moves and horrid acting . i was at the theater and deciding between this and meet the spartans and picked this . to my surprise the acting wasn  t bad at all and the movie was actually pretty good . the fact that it has a lower rating than you got served is absolutely ridiculous . instead of listening to the garbage posted on here i recommend going to see a matine showing of this movie so you don  t spend too much . i think you will be pleasantly surprised with how wrong everyone has been about it . when it comes to dance movies this is certainly one of the better ones with far superior acting than many of the other ones . go see the movie and judge for yourself . hopefully the rating will rise after it comes out on dvd and more people check the movie out instead of judging it based on comments before the movie released .  br    br   edit the movie is now moving closer to its correct rating . over     people have given it a rating of   a bit too high but at least it is helping to offset the ridiculous votes of  .  ,1
 . . . but a lousy film . as maltin says this was christopher lee  s attempt to make a serious horror film . well  it is serious . . . too serious  the plot is silly and slow  something about old people inhabiting the bodies of young children to achieve immortality  . . . the film is all talk talk talk talk talk talk talk about the same things over and over again . i actually dozed off a few times  the film is sooooo dull  the cast sleepwalks through this with the sole exceptions of peter cushing and lee . . . but this was probably a labor of love for both  they often complained about horror movies being too violent . . . well  this has no violence   . avoid at all costs . . . unless you have insomnia . . . this will put you to sleep   ,0
christopher lambert is annoying and disappointing in his portrayal as gideon . this movie could have been a classic had lambert performed as well as tom hanks in forrest gump  or dustin hoffman as raymond babbitt in rain man  or sean penn as sam dawson in i am sam .  br    br   too bad because the story line is meaningful to us in life  the supporting performances by charlton heston  carroll o  connor  shirley jones  mike connors and shelley winters were excelent .  of   .  ,0
the more i watch nicholas cage  the more i appreciate him as an actor . watching this movie now  in       i can see that it doesn  t really fit into the genre of movies that was coming out in the early   s . i don  t really think it can be considered a film noir  but it is pretty dark at times  due mostly to the lighting and odd personalities of the characters .  br    br   typical performances from each of the three main actors  who all did a good job with their roles . i thought  however  that hopper and boyle  s characters were left undeveloped  as it was sometimes hard to understand what they were doing and why they were doing it . hopper is a love him or hate him kind of guy . the plot is really good  and although i found some parts to be very unrealistic  there were parts where i had to hand it to the director  i . e . when he first sees the sheriff  . all in all  this movie is definitely worth watching .      ,1
i had the good fortune of reading the book before seeing the movie . it was an epic of adolescence  a dream of summers gone  a great potential indie film or big budget drama . it somehow got into the hands of a hack  who clearly took notes watching boogie nights and rushmore without actually learning anything at all . the script loses the meat of the book in favor of forced emotional notes and low brow gags . i feel sorry for the actors  since the characters in the book were rich and textured  but cut down to embarrassing charactures in the film . mason gamble is great when given the opportunity  as is dylan baker  but the skeleton that remains of the story plays out like a bad after school special . poor people  good  rich people  bad .  br    br   though it  s almost worth watching to see the southern california beach where gary sinise parks his trailer which is meant to pass for a bay in delaware .  br    br   it  s a good book  but an embarrassing turn for first time director mills goodloe .  br    br   k .  ,0
what a horrible movie . i cannot believe i wasted   mins of my life watching this re  make . please tell me why ving rhames and mehki pfifer starred in this film  mehki pfifer is great in e . r and ving rhames probably didn  t know what he was doing . i feel terrible for them . the music background i must say did not fit at alllll with the story and it  s amazing how you can find these directors who have absolutely no lives in creating a well and balanced film . i hope that in the future no director as horrible as this one was  could ever distroy such a great classic film . this film should not have been made in the first place . an advice to everyone who has seen it  please tell me that i  m right because i couldn  t possibly be the only viewer who did not enjoy it .  br    br   boooooo            out of   .  ,0
this is hardly a movie at all  but rather a real vaudeville show  filmed for the most part  in proscenium   and starring some of the greatest stage stars of the day .  singing in the bathtub  is an absolutely amazing production number that must be seen   be sure to wear your shower cap   ,1
pleasant  diverting and charming . the best part is the swing numbers  especially the rendition of my buddy  partial though it may have been . the acting was a bit over the top in areas but the mood set by wilder is so pleasant it is hard not to enjoy this film .  ,1
almost   years later i recall this original pbs film as almost unbearably tender . periodically  i check here at imdb hoping that someone has had the good sense to purchase the rights and put it on a dvd . it  s september of      and i keep hoping   deep sigh .  br    br   one of the two lead actors went on to a small career primarily in a prime  time evening soap the other  frances lee mccain  was seen in small roles here and there for a few years . but nothing they did before or after ever matched this little movie which was produced  as i recall it  on a short  lived pbs series which showcased original screenplays by new and up  and  coming playwrights .  br    br   i watched it every time it was shown on pbs  maybe  or  times . that was before the era of vcrs  so i have no record of it  except in my mind  s eye .  br    br             addition to above happy new year  ladies  this wonderful film is finally available on dvd at ladyslipper . org . my understanding is that the dvds are burned from the writer  s own personal copy .  ,1
this movie looked like it was going to be really funny . i was very excited to see it but was very disappointed . it was very unrealistic . the plot was also pretty weak . i was expecting it to be really funny but the jokes weren  t even that good . i was also really disappointed with the ending . i would not recommend this movie to anyone .  ,0
before i begin  you need to know that i am a huge fan of many of sonny chiba  s films . his biographical series of the life of his master  mas oyama  were amazing and among the best martial arts films ever made  as were most of his street fighter films . the action was practically non  stop and with the possible exception of bruce lee  depending on who you ask   he was the greatest martial arts practitioner on film during the     s . because they are so good  i  ve seen at least   of his films and recently bought some more  which i am in the process of watching  .  br    br   unfortunately  despite my love of these films  i am not a mind  numbed zombie who worships the man to such a degree that i rate every film a   . there are a few reviews like this here on imdb and i truly think that anyone giving this film a   should be ignored because this is such a bad film from a technical standpoint and isn  t even close to the being chiba  s best work . a score of   isn  t a real rating   it  s some zombie fan trying to make a statement about chiba  not this film  as i said  technically this film is awful . some of this was the result of my seeing the american dubbed version  with its irrelevant prologue and bad dubbing . but most of the problem would still exist with the original japanese print . the camera  work is simply atrocious   like it was done by chimps  smart chimps  but still chimps nonetheless  . often  much of the fast martial arts action is missed because the camera is so slow or the tops of the actors heads are clipped off due to the shoddiness of production . and  again and again  the camera pans in and out like it is a new toy being used by an idiot plus the editing is beyond wretched   with cuts being done haphazardly and confusingly .  br    br   i don  t know whether the musical score is original or not   but it was also very  very bad . sort of like acid rock of     blended poorly with ennio morricone  s  spaghetti western  music   it was annoying  distracting and just plain silly .  br    br   as for the martial arts action  i think that having chimps do the choreography would have improved things a bit . instead of the great fight scenes you  d look forward to in a chiba film  the fights are too brief and often missed by the camera   so what you are left with is the story . . . and this might just be the worst part of the film  it  s supposed to be an anti  drug film starring sonny chiba as . . . . sonny chiba  and when the film begins  he vows to destroy the drug trade in japan . but  the mafia  complete with not a single member who looks italian  but who are all japanese  vows to stop chiba . and  when a lady comes to chiba with promises to give him information about how to destroy the drug trade  he agrees to help her and risk his life with no conditions   even though she  s never forthright about telling him what she knows  in fact  later it turns out she is just trying to use chiba to protect her while she herself sells a huge briefcase full of cocaine   and he continues trying to protect her   this makes no sense at all and throughout much of the film it looks as if they just shot the film without a script   such as when they went into the bars and brothels and had chiba walking about as if he was drunk .  br    br   so if it was that bad  why still does it merit a   well  first  there are many more horrid marital arts films  such as many of those from hong kong in the     s    including one with guys dressed up in gorilla suits doing kung fu and their handlers with  foot long tongues they used for fighting  now that  s bad  . second  while the action is very bad compared to other sonny chiba films  compared to its contemporaries  it  s not that bad . still  you could easily do a lot better than this horrid little film .  br    br   by the way  if you are wondering if this is the worst sonny chiba film  it certainly is not  in one of his first films  invasion of the neptune men  chiba plays a leotard  wearing super  hero who battles pointy  headed invaders from the planet neptune . it  s so bad that it rivals plan  from outer space and they saved hitler  s brain for awfulness .  br    br   a final note to parents   like most of sonny chiba  s films  this one is very violent and has its share of boobies . don  t let little kids watch this no matter how much they beg  make them wait until they are older before you let them watch wretched rated  r martial arts films   ,0
ll cool j performed much better in this movie that i expected  he did a fabulous job acting as a  renegade  cop within a  renegade  department . from the very beginning  he does a great job of building viewer empathy for his character and the predicament he  s in . he acts as a sort of  gentle giant    a person whose rough exterior can scare anybody  yet whose heart is clearly in the right place from the very start   and he does an amazing job . he was quite clearly the best character in the movie .  br    br   this was certainly a performance that will not win morgan freeman any awards . after starring in powerhouse films like the shawshank redemption this film was certainly a step down . his role in edison simply did not allow him to show his true talents as an actor   and in terms of the conglomeration of characters placed him sadly on a back burner . there are so many ways his character  moses ashford  could have taken a more pivotal role . that he didn  t was disappointing and a true let  down . i was hoping to see more from him in this film .  br    br   timberlake ought to have stayed in the music industry . his portrayal of a young journalist was poorly acted and unpersuasive . this movie is a typical action movie that  at least initially  bears some resemblance to corrupt police affairs la has experienced in the past . being an action movie  it has its share of shoot  em  up scenes  blood  and guts . these scenes are typically unrealistic and painfully predictable . watching the beginning of the movie there is very little suspense as to what will happen at the end   think of what you would typically expect in a good  cops  bad  cops conflict   and it bears little resemblance to a real police shoot  out .  br    br   what irked me most was the way timberlake  s character behaved during shoot  out scenes . he starts out having guns and not using them . then when he finally gets around to using one he fires it as if he  s been firing a gun his whole life . then he runs out of bullets and doesn  t have a gun   and   seconds later  without moving or anything   suddenly has  more fully loaded guns and extra ammo   little plot errors like this really ruined the movie for me .  br    br   if what you are looking for is a blatantly fictional plot in a fantasy world where everything turns out okay  then you  ll probably love this movie . personally  it doesn  t matter to me what kind of movie it is as long as it is realistic . make me believe that the story is true . this story was so obviously fictional in so many aspects that i came away feeling unsatisfied .  ,0
i can  t believe i watched this expecting more . it starts out ok . this movie pushes the limits of reality way to far   at least the first one was somewhat realistic . it rips off the first movie and even mentions the joshua project . anyone who knows anything about computers will hate this movie . it does have one good message in it though  watch out for big brother    the movie just makes it seem like big brother is way bigger than he actually is in reality . that was very aggravating . even the make  up on the actors was completely bad . some of the acting is pretty good . some of the acting is really bad though . the script was ok at some points and completely messed up at other parts . this movie plays on convenience about every five minutes . like i said  i can  t believe i watched it expecting more . i think i am gonna pop in the original to get back to earth . . . q  ,0
holy crap this movie was bad . i watched it just as a joke . it isn  t even so bad that it  s good in an unintentional way . this film seemed to be designed to personally make me angry . it worked really well at doing that . it  s as if the people who made this just took all of the really annoying stuff about the movie priest  added in a bunch of ugly dudes  took out anything interesting  funny  or even remotely sexy and clever out of the concoction  and then added in a bunch of old rotten cheese . that  s all this is . cheese . there isn  t a single person this film could possibly connect to . there isn  t any universe this film could possibly take place in . why can  t a film like this just be about enjoying life and being happy  why did they have to make this already stupid idea for a film even more ridiculous than it already is  why couldn  t they at least even tried to make it an okay film  or even a b  movie . now that i think of it  what they hell were they trying to do with this film  i watched it expecting a campy love story and instead i got some boring student project about some idiot who has to find the strength and courage to marry his boyfriend while his annoying christian brother tried to destroy it all    no  i  m not joking . that  s what it  s about . does that sound good  this film is pretty ignorant against people of the christan religion  with it  s stereotyping of all christians being loudmouthed  rude  and hellbent on making as many people as miserable as possible . a lot of christian people i know would never speak or act like these freaks . the film  however  is just as unfair and ignorant to the gay community as well . these have got to be the most tastelessly crafted stereotypical gay men since the guy on the radio station on that roadkill video game . it  s so nerve wracking and simply irritating to the point that i wasn  t able to fully pay attention to this film . the makers of this train  wreck had no strategy for set design  acting  camera angles  lighting  script  authenticity  or an idea to make this entertaining or interesting . there isn  t even a single sex scene  or at least not a believable one . jamie brett gabel was the only guy in the film that looked any good at all  but his good looks were sadly put to waste . this is trash . in a perfect world  this film would get voted a  .  . it  s worth  as a film alone . a mentally handicapped nun who is blind  deaf  and has tiny little bones for arms and legs and whose face is located on her armpit could write  direct  and produce a better film  and she  d probably be a better actor as well . the fact that this film exists is a crime against the word  film  itself . this film is so bad that other films should be ashamed of being available in the same watchable format . i could put a broom in a chair and then record it with a camera and then stop the film and then replace it with a mini x  mas tree and then record that and i  ve already made a film that will always be better than ben  arthur by at least half . there are only two things worse than death . torture and watching ben  arthur . i  m a homosexual and i will probably be the gayest person you will ever meet if you ever met me  and i don  t think i  ve ever been more offended by an entire film than i was by the first five seconds of this film alone . if this movie was a mistake  i will personally find a way to change the famous phrase  it  s okay to make mistakes  to  it  s okay to make mistakes unless that mistake was ben  arthur .  you know how people always say things like   good things come out of everything    i think that ben  arthur was primarily invented so that there could be something on this earth that nothing good would ever come out of . to call this movie the worst movie i  ve ever seen would be giving it way too much credit . it  s as if this film were designed just so that it could qualify in a category of it  s very own . there are good movies  there are bad movies  and then there  s ben  arthur . this is ben and arthur .  ,0
of course the plot  script  and  especially casting are strong in the film . so many fine things to see . one aspect i liked especially is the idea of the antagonist   luzhini  s  turturro  s    ex  mentor working his evil on the sidelines . his chess opponent   an italian dandy in three piece and cane   turns out to be a real gent  and a truly fine chess player . to his credit the  opponent  nobly goes along with the plan at the end to complete the final game for the championship posthumously  luzhin has taken a flyer out a window   sad  but so releasing to him  by way of the unstable genius  widow  emily watson .  in death  then  because of the gallantry of an honorable chess master  luzhin  s defence  which he worked out in a late moment of lucidity  is allowed to be played . the italian gent commends the play and calls it brilliant . talk about a dramatic  end game    ,1
this is one of the worst films i  ve seen . the only positive thing i can say is it was so bad that is seemed comical . first off  there  s no plot . the actors appear to be reading off cue cards and do the dumbest things . such as being chased by dead people but yet wanting to go out and look for their friends . also the zombies were terrible  no where near as fun as any of romero  s work  who gets s plug in the movie . and the dumbest part of all was they kept showing flashes of the video game in the action sequences . like we don  t get the video game is about shooting zombies . also  all the   somethings some how know how to use automatic weapons and hit a target without even aiming the gun . and the way the people die is so stupid . it  s like they run out of ammo so stand around waiting to be jumped on . and when cornered in front of the house they run out of ammo instead of shooting the door open  so dumb .  br    br   final verdict if any of these actors appear in another film  then they  ve been blessed with a second chance . definitely the worst film i  ve seen in years . a b  movie on cinemax is better .  ,0
if you  ve ever seen an eighties slasher  there isn  t much reason to see this one . originality often isn  t one of slasher cinema  s strongpoints  and it  s something that this film is seriously lacking in . there really isn  t much that can said about pranks  so i  ll make this quick . the film was one of the   films included on the dpp video nasty list  and that was my only reason for seeing it . the plot follows a bunch of kids that stay behind in a dorm at christmas time . as they  re in a slasher  someone decides to start picking them off and this leads to one of the dullest mysteries ever seen in a slasher movie . the fact that this movie was on the video nasty list is bizarre because  despite a few gory scenes  this film is hardly going to corrupt or deprave anyone  and gorier slashers than this  friday the   th  for example  didn  t end up banned . but then again  there  s banned films that are much less gory than this one  the witch who came from the sea  for example  . anyway  the conclusion of the movie is the best thing about it  as although the audience really couldn  t care less who the assailant is by this point it is rather well done . on the whole  this is a dreary and dismal slasher that even slasher fans will do well to miss .  ,0
this is best comedy i ever seen  but not all can understand this you must be from georgia to understand this amazing movie    overall one of best film i ever seen . . . . . . . . . vachtangi  benjamin  and all supporting actors playing very very good but acting of kote daoshvili  father germogel  is for my opinion best acting in supporting role in history of films    in this movie playing many georgian stars like ipolite xvichia  sergo zakariadze  sofiko chiaureli  verikoan djafaridze  sesilia takaishvili  dodo abashidze . . . . they all are stars in georgian cinematography   plus in this movie is playing great russian star evgeni leonov and of course director of the film georgy danelia is one of the best . . . . . . i recommending this movie for everyone but remember you must know good russian language to watch this movie  ,1
a surprisingly good movie  it has quite a few good jokes thru out the whole movie . the only negative thing is that some scenes go to the extremes to show just how stupid the two main characters are . we get it  stupid blondes  get on with it   br    br   the plot just barely dodges being called  corny  . and boobies are always a plus altho the movie for some strange reason doesn  t play with that card very much even tho the plot line introduces two black haired women who act as the evil counter part of our two blondes .  br    br   so all in all  a good movie to watch . i almost gave it an      but let  s not get crazy .  ,1
i saw this when i was   and haven  t seen it since . the  cbs late movie  used to show it on a regular basis at one point . i remember how sad and upsetting it was  it truly made me sick to my stomach . effects then weren  t what they are today  but nevertheless  it conveyed the feeling of being alone in the amazon  after losing both parents and searching for a way out  very well . i remember the bugs and maggots the most  so realistic they were  eating her flesh . it  s a dark film which was controversial subject matter at the time  even though likely it was strongly edited for tv . i wish i remembered more details  and if i ever get the chance to see it again  i can comment more . i have been looking for this for years . i believe it may have been shown on cbs under yet another title . i have no idea whether it was ever released on video .  ,1
what i think i  ll probably like best about the new star wars film   phantom menace   is that it will likely blow  titanic  out of the water  if you  ll pardon the pun  when it comes to sheer devastating box office receipts  and thereby knock it out of the number one spot . every time i hear someone declare  titanic  is the greatest film they  ve ever seen  i think to myself   you don  t see a lot of movies  do you   what a travesty . you could make   good films that are a lot better than  titanic   and for the same price tag .  br    br    well  it won lots of academy awards  lots of people really loved it   as someone might say in its defence . well  lots of people like the spice girls and billions and billions of people eat at mcdonald  s  but that doesn  t mean it  s high quality . yes  millions of elvis fans can be wrong .  br    br   i  ll be the first to admit  that part of the problem for me was the mega  hype over the film . i waited a month or so to see it and ultimately  it didn  t live up to the expectations set upon it  which simply called more attention to the appallingly stupid love story . it  s true   phantom menace  will likely suffer a similar fate . but .  br    br   james cameron  s  titanic  is . a  a cheesy action flick thinly disguised as a serious period piece . b  a three  hour epic that has it  s finest moments given away in the trailer . c  a sappy love story beyond belief or entertainment . d  something left better to documentarians  which i would  ve enjoyed much more . e  a film with arrogance that lives up to the level demonstrated with the real ship . f  a robbery of  hours that i will never get back  therefore the greatest motivation for a time machine i can think of . when i meet someone who hasn  t seen it yet  i say   i wish i could trade places with you .  g  a slap in the face to any genuine victim of hypothermia . how long are we supposed to believe that people can be immersed in freezing cold water and still form intelligible sentences  h  thankfully a film that wasn  t recognized for any acting achievements at the oscars . i  a technological achievement in filmmaking  and little else .  br    br   the only reason i post this as a anonymous comment is i do not welcome the rebuttal of       thirteen year old leonardo dicaprio fans who  ll no doubt come to his defense  and i am not really interested in hearing a defense of titanic  s story  acting or length .  ,0
but there are not too many of them . probably the worst  major release  film i have seen in my life . definitely the worst for this year . there is no point in commenting on the plot  the cast or the acting . the problem is beyond all that . it lays in the absolute stupidity of the annoying kind  not the funny kind  of everything that takes place on the screen . i don  t know why i gave it a     instead of     . probably  because of steven martini . he really did try . bottom line    minutes washed down the toilet along with a few brain cells . avoid at any cost .  ,0
  the seventh sign  borrows a lot from  rosemary  s baby  and  the omen   it actually blends the two stories  . even its title recalls bergman  s  the seventh seal  .  br    br   nevertheless  it begins well enough  with all the omens scattered on the whole earth  and in parallel  a  seemingly  distinct plot with moore  s husband trying to save a poor boy  who killed his parents who were brother and sister  from death penalty . this time  both christian and jewish religions are called to the rescue  even the wandering jew is involved   which makes the lines sometimes unintentionally funny  have you ever been to sunday school  but they taught me that god was love   . the best scene imho  is the short dialog between priest john heard  who does not seem to take things seriously  too bad he was not given a more important part because his laid  back acting is priceless  and the young jew .  br    br   demi moore probably registered the same desire as ex  husband bruce willis saving the world . she does not save the movie for all that .  ,0
i rated this a  . the dubbing was as bad as i have seen . the plot  yuck . i  m not sure which ruined the movie more . jet li is definitely a great martial artist  but i  ll stick to jackie chan movies until somebody tells me jet  s english is up to par .  ,0
although this isn  t a  great film   there  s something compelling and memorable about it . like another commenter on the film  i saw this in childhood . it  s been thirty three years since      but i have never forgotten the story or its ridiculously cumbersome title . see it if you have the opportunity . you  ll feel like a voyeur of small town life as it evolves through the decades . more than any other film  this one brings a human face to the historical drama of early twentieth century  progress .  it  s engaging enough for a young viewer and memorable enough for an older one . furthermore  it  s easy to like the characters and watch their passage through time .  ,0
well . . . the movie was a fun watch . the main problem with this movie is the fact that it goes against everything that most vampire myths abide by . like vampires that walk in the sunlight . though there are parts that just make you enjoy the way society makes movies . a scene where a vampire gets stabbed and screams  ow this hurts . . . it  s really stuck .  then there seems like there might be scenes missing but you get used to after a while . and there are random dream sequenes  that really don  t help with the plot . come to think of it  nothing really made sense  but i just got a bunch of friends and watched it twice to get the full effect . come to think of it the fight scenes were aweful  and the zombies were just fun to watch . slowly as i write more of this i like this movie more . but you know  all in all you can  t expect schindlers list but its a fun watch .  ,0
since crouching tiger hidden dragon came along  there  s been a lot of talk about a revival of the hong kong movie industry . don  t believe it . the people now making movies in hk give new meaning to the word crass . running out of time  is a perfect example . ekin cheng is the name draw  here  but he spends most of the film just grinning idiotically and flipping a coin . he flips the coin over and over and again and again . why  who knows  sean lau plays a cop who chases after the coin  flipping pretty boy . but once again who knows why  there  s a pretty actress in the female lead who runs some sort of company and she has to pay a ransom or something but she mostly just looks like she would rather be at a spa or shopping centre than in front of a camera . nothing makes any sense . there is no action . there is no sex . there is no comedy . all there is is a name ekin cheng . and you know what  who cares   ,0
you may say to yourself   don johnson as elvis  can that work  is it possible  seems like an terrible choice to me  but perhaps i should have an open mind . maybe i  ll be surprised . maybe he can pull it off .   br    br   not   br    br   don johnson is not a bad actor . but he is an awful elvis . he  s too short  too weak  voiced  too sharply featured . . . well you  ve already imagined how bad he would be . add to that a hokey black wig and heavy  handed eye  liner and mascara and it  s a big fat embarrassing mess .  br    br   the best i can say is that since johnson  s acting is decent and since his impersonation is so far off  after a while you don  t even think of him as elvis anymore . you see him as some other crazed pop star instead . then  on that level  the movie becomes watchable .  br    br   stephanie zimbalist is also not ideally cast as the tall  beauty queen  linda thompson . but she is attractive in her own right and plays the part with the honesty  elegance and intelligence we  ve come to expect from all her roles . there may be too much intelligence in her performance . you have to be kind of a dope to stick with a dope abusing dope .  br    br   there  s nothing new to this story we  ve heard it many times before . if you  ve looking for new info or insight  you won  t find it . it  s told as a love story  an unrequited one linda for elvis and elvis for drugs .  ,0
  br    br   the movie starts out as an ordinary comic  hero  movie . its about the boy who is picked on  has no parents and is madly in love with the schools   girl . nothing surprises in the movie  there is nothing that you cant guess coming in the movie . toby mcguire shows us that either he is no good actor or that no actor in the world can save a script like this one . maybe kids around the age of ten can enjoy the film but it is a bit violent for the youngest . you cant get away from thinking of movies like x  men  batman and spawn . all of those titles are better . i almost walked out the last   minutes  one thing that could have been good though was the computeranimation  but not even that is anything to put in the christmas  tree  so my recomendation dont see this film even if you get paid for it   ,0
where to start . . . oh yea  message to the bad guys when you first find the person you have been tracking  in order to kill  that witnessed a crime you committed  don  t spend time talking to her so that she has yet another opportunity to get away . message to the victim when the thugs are talking amongst themselves and arguing  take that opportunity to  run away   don  t sit there and watch them until you make a noise they hear . message to the director if someone has a  or   minute head start in a vehicle or on foot  you can  t have the bad guys on their heels or bumper right away  time and motion doesn  t work that way . it would also be nice to think that a woman doesn  t have to brutally kill    men in order to empower herself to leave an abusive relationship at home .  ,0
return to the lost world was filmed back  to  back with the     version of the lost world .  br    br   in this sequel  the same five people  lead by challenger return to the plateau where a group has started drilling for oil which is threatening to destroy the land . gomez has something to do with this . they manage to defeat the drillers and the plateau is saved  much to the delight of the natives .  br    br   like in the lost world  what few dinosaurs we see are made of rubber and these include a t  rex and ankylosaurus .  br    br   john ryhs  davies and david warner reprise their roles as challenger and summerlee and three of the other actors are also back .  br    br   despite reading several bad reviews of this and those cheap looking rubber dinosaurs  i enjoyed return to the lost world .  br    br   rating  stars out of  .  ,1
this is  without a doubt  the single worst movie ever created . there  s no arguing here . this is it . end of story . the story is juvenile and sub  moronic  looking like it was created by a three  year  old fascinated with dinosaurs . the entire concept is just plain dumb . it  s inconceivable how someone could possibly come up with something so stupid and think it was entertaining . the jokes are also completely lame . if you haven  t seen this movie yet  consider yourself lucky . if your morbidly curious as to how bad this movie is  please don  t make me describe it . words can  t express how completely awful this movie is . this isn  t just bad as in being a bad movie . even those have cohesion  if not entertainment value . this . . . this is . . . ugh  think of the worst story ever told and multiply its badness level by       and you still haven  t come close to how awful this movie is . after giving pokemon the movie one point  giving this movie one point seems like nothing short of charity . that  s how bad it is . did the producers and directors even take film classes  because this is a perfect example of how not to make a film . it looks like some amateur high on paint thinner made this film . if you rented this  please take it back and ask for a refund . and don  t even think about renting it again .  ,0
i  ve seen this film literally over    times . . . it  s absolutely jam  packed with entertainment    powers boothe gives a stellar performance . as a fan of actors such as william shatner  impulse       and ron liebmann  up the academy       i never thought an actor could capture the  intensity  like shatner and liebmann in those roles  until i saw boothe as jim jones  as far as i  m concerned  powers boothe is jim jones . . . this film captures his best performance     ,1
as if there weren  t enough of those floating around at the time already  we have here another lame godfather clone from the director of il consigliori       which i had watched earlier this year . the marquee  value name roped in this time is telly savalas who belatedly enters the proceedings and is first seen from behind  rather campily tending to his flowers and wearing a beret in the style of french painters  apart from not looking minimally sicilian  he sports no accent of any kind other than his familiar drawl . antonio sabato  then  makes for an unlikely gangster  apart from being a resistible leading man his relationship with savalas  which becomes paternal at the flick of an eye  is also unconvincing  especially since he subsequently becomes romantically involved with the latter  s spirited teenage niece   besides  for a gangster flick  there  s precious little action to speak of and none of it is in any way memorable  though the finale set in a clinic is well enough handled   furthermore  the score by francesco de masi is serviceable but nothing else . incidentally  the bargain  basement dvd i rented starts off midway through the credits so that none of the cast members  or even the film  s title  is ever listed   ,0
a beautiful postcard of new york . the thing i enjoyed most was being able to watch this with my whole family and not cringe waiting for a stupid toilet humor joke to appear . it never did . my teenagers liked it too . my son for natasha henstridge and my daughter for michael vartan . my wife and i commented that we could not remember the last time we could sit with the kids and all enjoy something . this film told a story that felt comfortable but not old or done . the ending came with a twist which we all liked too . if you are not just a cynical person and have are willing to let a story unfold then this is for you . as a guy it takes a lot to hold my interest when it comes to romantic movies and this one did . i recommend it and we need more of these films to watch .  ,1
can a  pix ever  ever  ever do anything right  this movie was meant to be seen on tv in a letterbox format . since a  pix doesn  t even believe in pan and scan  we see whole scenes where a shoulder on the left side of the screen talks to a shoulder on the right side . of course  not that you are missing much . this movie is incredibly bad . it  s very hard to enjoy a film where characters are screaming at the top of their lungs during    of the movie for no reason .  ,0
when anti  bush jokes get really easy to do  a show like this had better make sure it has something extra . when that something extra is kid versions of political figures making jokes about the future they don  t have yet  it  s just plain nonsense . dick cheney and george bush are done well but dick cheney mutters mostly . there  s also condoleeza rice who has a crush on bush for some reason and donald rumsfeld who isn  t really that similar to donald rumsfeld at all . the democratic characters rarely give their names so it  s a mystery as to who could be who aside from barack obama and hilary clinton .  br    br   the episodes have coherent stories but that  s not nearly enough to keep this from sinking .  ,0
i have to say i totally loved the movie . it had it  s funny moments  some heartwarming parts  just all around good . me  personally  really liked the movie because it  s something that finally i can relate to my childhood . this movie  in my opinion  is geared more towards the young gay population . it shows how a young gay boy would be treated while growing up . all the taunting  name  calling  and not knowing is something i  like most other young feminine boys  will always remember  and now finally a movie that illustrates how hard it really is to grow up gay . so  i would definitely recommend seeing this movie . probably shouldn  t really watch it until a person is old and mature enough to understand it  ,1
confounding melodrama taken from a william gibson story  produced by john houseman and directed by vincente minnelli  richard widmark heads up posh  upscale rural nervous asylum  where his loose wife battles with self  appointed queen bee lillian gish  and widmark himself gets the straying eye for staff  newcomer lauren bacall  who is putting her life back together after the death of her husband and child . facetious and muddled  set in an indiscriminate time and place  and with a  david and lisa  love story hidden in the plush morass . widmark and bacall do have some good chemistry together  but this script gives them nothing to build on . for precisely an hour  most of the dialogue concerns what to do about the drapes hanging in the library  this thread isn  t used as symbolism  rather it  s a red herring in a non  mystery   . the picture hopes to show the loggerheads that disparate people come to when they  re working in the same profession and everyone thinks their opinion is right  but unfortunately the roundabout way minnelli unravels this stew is neither informative  enlightening nor entertaining .  from   ,0
with this topic  it is so easy to take cheap shots . you know  the guy with hairy legs trying to look like marilyn monroe . not here   adrian pasdar does a superb job of making gerald a real person  someone you care deeply about  and as a result you feel for his plight trying to live both as gerald and geraldine . not only that  but as geraldine  he looks hot  and the chemistry between him and julie walters is electric . these are two characters who feel love for one another  and it comes through even when they simply look at each other over the breakfast table . even the potentially cheesy sub  story line of corporate takeovers is believable  and you find yourself cheering at the end  at least i did   ,1
saw this on cable back in the early    s and loved it . never saw it again until it showed up on cable again recently . still find it a great vietnam movie . not sure why its not higher rated . i found everything about this film compelling . as a vet  not from vietnam  i can relate to the situations brought by both harris and de niro . i can only imagine this film being more poignant now with our situation in iraq . i wish this would be offered on cable more often for people to see . the human toll on our soldiers isn  t left on the battlefield . its brought home for the rest of there lives . and this film is one of many that brings that home in a very hard way . excellent film .  ,1
i was expecting a little something from  k       i mean it did look like a cute movie that i could get into . i always did love the dog comedy movies . but it looked like it was supposed to be jame  s movie  not jerry lee  s . the plot was pretty lame and the two love interests really didn  t have chemistry to begin with . not to mention that james seemed to have a total sexist view in the movie despite the fact the writer wasn  t going in that direction . james just really ticked me off for more than half the film . the dogs were the true stars and that  s pretty sad that they out shined the actors .  br    br   so  i  m glad it  s not just me on imdb who agrees that this was a pretty stupid movie . but hopefully  james will realize it was his brother jim who was the talented one  no offense  but not everyone can be their star sibling . don  t you wish ashlee simpson would take that same advice  d  br    br        ,0
this movie is very great  the acting is fine  with excellent casting of corbin bernsen as the perfectionistic dentist who freaks out and tortures his patients . in the beginning he sees his wife with the poolman  and then he goes crazy . he also takes revenge on his wife and the poolman  beside the patients he tortures . the most special effects are also beautiful  although some are really fake  like a drilled  out tongue  that has laid for  night outside  and is still red in the morning  . but the torture scenes are absolutely well  done . though this movie has the weak point that it is very slow between the heavy parts are sometimes just extremiously boring parts . but for the real horror  thriller  fan this is a must  watch   ,1
my complaints here concern the movie  s pacing and the material at hand . while using archival film and letters lends the film a fresh and interesting perspective  too often the material selected to highlight simply isn  t very interesting  such as when goebbels complains about this or that ailment  tc .  or the ad nauseam footage of his small german hometown  . also  the movie crawls along in covering c .          and then steams through the war years . in sum  the film is little better than a history channel documentary  with the exception that the filmmaker has a slightly greater sensibility than your average history channel documentary editor and thus can more artfully arrange the details of goebbels  life . still  i found it wanting .  ,0
to be honest i had heard this was pretty bad before i decided to watch it  but i  m never one to let others influence my viewings  in fact i  m more likely to watch something out of defiance  . bullwhip had one thing going for me before the viewing anyway  the fact that rhonda fleming and those gorgeous eyes was in it had me interested right away . the picture isn  t very good  and is in fact very morally dubious  all the characters are corrupt and shifty in one way shape or form  all motivated by greed or egocentric victories  this is all well and good if the surrounding film can do justice to a bunch of despicable people and create a taut climax shuddering picture . sadly it doesn  t  and as the finale fills your eyes with sugar you can  t help shouting out that you have been cheated into watching a pretty bad film  nobody in the cast come out with any credit  with lead man guy madison painfully wooden in the extreme .  br    br   not even the lovely rhonda can make me recommend this to anyone       ,0
i just saw this film last night in the     tribeca film festival and it seriously makes me wonder if the folks at the festival actually screen the films before selecting them . the film was simply awful  i say that without hyperbole or ulterior motives  it was awful . matthew modine  s days as a leading man are way over . gina gershon sported an inexplicable and unnecessary english accent  she should be ashamed of her participation in this film . gloria reuben had a weird little cameo in it  she should also be ashamed . the script was terrible and the we were given absolutely no reason to care about the characters . i highly doubt this will be picked up  but then again  people in hollywood are known to make mistakes sometimes . i really think  kettle of fish  is a serious contender for the worst movie i  ve ever seen .  ,0
as part of our late     s vocabulary  we well knew the ponderosa  little joe  hoss  ben cartwright  etc . on that great show  bonanza .   br    br   it came saturday night and everyone was glued to the television set . this was a real show depicting family values . there may have been a weekly crisis  but it was the strong family atmosphere that pulled everyone together .  br    br   lorne greene was dominant as the patriarch of the family . his words depicted wisdom . we often were left to wonder that ben cartwright  a widower  must have been the best of husbands to that poor wife of his who had died . he reared wonderful sons .  br    br   naturally  we all wondered why pernell roberts left the show . the show was a gold mine and roberts surrendered loads of money when he departed . his career never took off as he was associated as a cartwright son . he should have tried to get back into the series . he certainly lost a bonanza by dropping out .  ,1
maslin beach is a real nudist  naturist beach south of adelaide  on the fleurieu peninsula  in south australia . it is also the name of an australian film that used the beach as a location .  br    br   maslin beach is labelled a romantic comedy . this could be slightly misleading  as it is not a  hilarious  film  nor is it really romantic in the traditional sense  but it does have light  hearted moments . much as life itself  there are also moments of sadness too . it is also entirely shot at the nudist beach mentioned above  and nudity runs throughout the length of film . the viewer quickly learns to accept this as normal  and concentrate on the plot  not the copious amount of flesh .  br    br   simon and marcie  michael allen and eliza lovell  arrive by car at a beach  side car park . they take their belongings to the beach  and while they are walking  a voice  over from simon talks about his confusion about what real love is . the rest of the film is an exploration of this  framed by one complete day at the beach . the basic story is of what happens to simon  s love life  but there are also many other characters highlighted in several separate vignettes .  br    br   when they arrive at the beach  both simon and marcie appear bored with each other . marcie sees them as a  romeo and juliet  romantic couple . simon is just bored with it all . next  we are introduced to gail  bonnie  jaye lawrence   paula  zara collins  and jenny  jennifer ross  . they are walking down the beach together discussing gail  s chances of finding the  perfect  man  aided by the  powers  of a necklace that brought good luck to her grandmother . however  there are many more interesting people on the beach  not all of them  attractive  and young  part of the realism of this film  .  br    br   to service the beach  s patrons there is a flatulent  short  sighted ice  cream salesperson with a van . this is ben  gary waddell   who is a friend of simon  and is also his unofficial counsellor . i would think that this character is the main comic element . it is hard to say though  as there is nothing about ben that would make you laugh aloud  unless you were intoxicated  male and very young  maslin beach does have a major redeeming feature though  and that is that it does not dwell too long on any one subject . as the quality of acting is variable  the script is suspect and everything about maslin beach is cheap  the lack of continuity is a positive boon . in fact  there is something about this film  not the nudity  that i find appealing . it is hard to define what it is  but it could be something to do with its bluntness  and downright  aussie  attitude to carnal matters .  br    br   the camera work in maslin beach deserves a mention . sometimes it is very good  with some stunning static shots and  pans  of the beach  cliffs and a sunset . as nudity is a major factor in this film  framing is an important aspect of the camera work . there is no sense of gratuity in the framing  meaning that the framing is done so that the camera does not dwell on  private  body parts . this helps to ease any sense of viewer discomfort from being within the subject  s  personal space   and makes the film more tasteful . not an easy task  given the location for filming .  br    br   maslin beach is neither a  skin flick  for post  pubescent  testosterone charged males  nor a  mills and boon  romance for under  appreciated women . maslin beach does not seem to fit anywhere in genre . the actors are not  attractive  in the baywatch sense  and are just  normal  people that you would see on the beach anywhere . it does not have a message to put across and it would not even act as a tourism advertisement  other than perhaps to naturists . apart from the australian accent  the filming could have been in any sunny country . what makes this film distinctly australian is the fact that it is pointless  cinema verite    and only australian cinema  and other medium sized national cinemas  could consider such a rash option . at the same time  these medium sized cinemas have room for experimentation in the quest for identity  and a  flop  is not going to damage their reputation too much . it is always possible  given that maslin beach is now a collector  s item  that the film might become internationally popular  but it is very unlikely .  br    br   during this critique  i have been sounding highly negative  at times  about maslin beach . this is not the real position  as i found the film very easy to watch . i enjoyed it as a reflection of near reality and real people  and problems  . the problems confronted in the film are those of the everyday  and a little low on spectacle . this does it no harm in my view  and i wish that more films dealt with the everyday like this . there is a connection here with the cinemas of europe  and with french film in particular . they rarely deal with major disasters or catastrophes  but with the everyday . hollywood is in direct opposition to this  and rides the crest of the hyper  real action  drama  angst wave . the pace too  is much faster in hollywood  but it is not reality . maslin beach is not exactly  jacques tati  either  but it is on the right track  even if it does ignore issues of multi culturalism  equality  gender orientation and so on  that are of such importance in current cinema . i am sure that you will either love or hate this film  with little room for a middle ground .  br    br    ,1
the internet database lists this as a tv show . and yes  it was a series on mtv shown on the  oddities  program  after  the head  and before  aeon flux  if i recall correctly . but the version i watched this time was a vhs tape with all the episodes run together into a film without annoying credits in between or having to wait a week for the next fifteen minutes .  br    br   you have the story of the maxx  julie winters  sarah and mr . gone . the maxx is a super  hero or a bum  julie a social worker or a leopard queen  sarah a girl who should listen to less of the smiths and mr . gone a guy who can  t seem to keep his head on . and then there  s the other weird creatures . . .  br    br   i use  or  with maxx and julie  because part of the fun is trying to figure out which parts of the story are real and which are dreams . maybe they  re all real or dreams . maybe one of the characters doesn  t exist . maybe only one exists and dreams of the others . you  ll have to wait and find out .  br    br   i had the comic books before the show came out  and it was one of my favorites . the artwork was spectacular and the story was original   unlike anything you  ll find in superman or batman . it will bend your mind  and has strong adult overtones without being obscene or offensive . and the show used basically the same exact artwork  only now it moves  and the same story . . . guaranteeing that the beauty intrinsically found in the comic would be faithfully reproduced . this was the best show to appear on  oddities   hands down .  br    br   if you like comics of a darker nature or need a good mind trip  this is a show to check out . it  s  donnie darko  before there was ever such a thing .  br    br   the most astonishing thing is that this never went on to become another movie or television series  but i don  t say this in disappointment . by keeping it simple  they have sealed this movie in gold and kept it free from the blemishes brought on by successive failures .  ,1

while the premise behind the house where evil dwells may be intriguing  the execution is downright pathetic . i  m not even sure where to begin as i  ve got so many problems with this movie . i suppose i  ll just number a few of them  br    br    . the acting  when you see that edward albert  doug mcclure  and susan george  and her teeth  are the stars of your movie  you know you  re in trouble  not that it matters much to me  but these are hardly a  list names . susan george may have been in a couple of movies i enjoy  but i  ve never considered her the greatest actress i  ve ever seen . and in this movie  her acting is embarrassing . as for the other two  the less said the better .  br    br    . the ghosts  the ghosts or spirits or whatever you want to call them reminded me quite a bit of the ghosts in the haunted mansion ride . at disney world . and  they are about as frightening . and why did they have to be so obvious  subtlety is not a characteristic of the house where evil dwells .  br    br    . the plot  how predictable can one movie be  the outcome of this movie is painfully obvious once you meet the three main characters . if you couldn  t see where this movie was headed after about   minutes  you need to see more movies .  br    br    . the convenient priest  what are the chances that the haunted house you buy just happens to be across the street from a group of japanese monks  not to mention that one of them knows the history of your house and comes over  knocks on the door  and asks if you need help removing evil spirits . absurd is a word that comes to mind .  br    br    . everything else  it  s very difficult for me to think of any positives to write about . i suppose i  ll give it a point for the opening scene and a point for the house  s architecture . that  s a sure sign of a winner  noting the architecture as a highlight of any film doesn  t say much about the actual movie .  br    br   i  ll stop . you should be able to get the idea from what i  ve already mentioned . and  i haven  t even mentioned the annoying little girl or the invasion of the crabs or a multitude of other problems . be warned  this thing is horrible .  ,0

sometimes you need to see a bad movie just to appreciate the good ones . well  that  s my opinion anyway . this one will always be in the bad movie category  simply because all but shu qi  s performance was terrible .  br    br   martial angel tells of cat  shu qi   a professional thief turned straight after leaving her lover  chi lam  julian cheung   two years before . but her past returns to haunt her as chi lam is kidnapped for the ransom of security software belonging to the company cat works for . in order to rescue him  she calls on her old friends from her orphanage days  six other feisty women  to save the day . . .  br    br   i may have told the synopsis cheesily  but this is a cheesy story . in fact  the whole script and direction lacked any quality at all . much of the dialogue was meaningless and coupled with a plot that was as thin as rice  paper in water . if i could sum it up  take a bad jackie chan movie  remove the comedy  remove the choreography  throw away the budget  and you have martial angels a formulaic piece of work with no imagination at all .  br    br   mind you  i do have to give credit where credit  s due  and shu qi was probably the only person to emerge unscathed from the terrible action  as it was her performance that shone through . okay  you can  t say she was excellent  after all she had absolutely nothing to work with  but she did manage to dig some character out from her role . other than that  only sandra ng and kelly lin made any other impression  although these were mostly glimmers and very brief .  br    br   elsewhere  the film just fell to pieces . scenes and dialogue were completely unnatural and unbelievable  special effects were obviously done on the cheap with no attempt to clean up edges between persons and the mask of the blue screen  poor editing involving numerous discontinuities in fight scenes  camera angles that were elementary and unflattering  and direction i  ve seen better from a lost dog .  br    br   i guess this film was a too many cooks affair . most probably  the budget was blown away on the over  enthusiasm to have seven babes on the same silver screen . that didn  t leave much else .  br    br   frankly  the way this film was made was like a cheap porn movie without the porn . charlie  s angels  it ain  t . in fact  while sisters can do it for themselves  none of that was really that apparent here .  br    br   definitely one to forget .  ,0

movie there are some very interesting comments on imdb about this movie . its truly awful . not enough money is spent on the movie and the way spike lee has made it  it seems like a combination of an indie film and an action flick . characters  actors denzel has done  exactly  what he does in every movie  so no surprise there . here is a little mind game for the readers . quickly think of   denzel movies . now count how many of them were in which he played a cop  detective  body guard  whatever . clive owen  hmmmmmm  this guy needs a better role on his plate soon . his best performance was i think in  beyond borders  . other than that he did pretty much the same thing as he does in every movie as well . his tone and way of talking was very similar to what he did in  sin city  . surely this guy knows acting  what he doesn  t know is better way of choosing roles . he is in desperate need of a better agent . jodie foster was brilliant in the movie  if you are watching her for the first time in your life . she has done better . she has had better roles . it so happens in hollywood that even the biggest stars fall down on their knees and pick up low class roles as jody foster did in this movie . plot plot was not confusing  in fact  i could think of such a plot  in fact the whole movie  while taking a dump after a nice big chinese dinner . i mean come on  spoiler on the way      i am sick of the un  necessary haulocast and the racism token . the movie is about bank robbers  why put the haulocast and the racism in there  nice try playing with people  s emotions  worked on anyone  not me . police let the bank robbers go thinking they were hostages  riiiiiiight  please  we  re talking about us police force and security here . nobody could find out where clive was  i mean they didn  t find anything different with that room . who  re we kidding  conclusion sure  go watch this movie  if nothing  you  ll have a nice time talking to you friends how bad the movie was . at least people won  t think you  re stupid to go watch this movie because they  d think you went to watch it because it has a big star cast  mistake  .  ,0

hilarious  evocative  confusing  brilliant film . reminds me of bunuel  s l  age d  or or jodorowsky  s holy mountain   lots of strange characters mucking about and looking for . . . . . what is it  i laughed almost the whole way through  all the while keeping a peripheral eye on the bewildered and occasionally horrified reactions of the audience that surrounded me in the theatre . entertaining through and through  from the beginning to the guts and poisoned entrails all the way to the end  if it was an end . i only wish i could remember every detail . it haunts me sometimes .  br    br   honestly  though  i have only the most positive recollections of this film . as it doesn  t seem to be available to take home and watch  i suppose i  ll have to wait a few more years until crispin glover comes my way again with his big slide show  and subsequent  what is it   screening  . . . i saw this film in atlanta almost directly after being involved in a rather devastating car crash  so i was slightly dazed at the time  which was perhaps a very good state of mind to watch the prophetic talking arthropods and the retards in the superhero costumes and godlike glover in his appropriate burly  q setting  scantily clad girlies rising out of the floor like a magnificent dadaist wet dream .  br    br   is it a statement on life as we know it  of course everyone expects art to be just that . i rather think that the truth is more evident in the absences and in the negative space . what you don  t tell us is what we must deduce  but is far more valid than the lies that other people feed us day in and day out . rather one  what is it   than     movies like  titanic  or  sleepless in seattle   shudder  gag  groan  .  br    br   thank you  mr . glover  additionally a fun man to watch on screen or at his big slide show   smart  funny  quirky  and outrageously hot  . make more films  write more books  keep the nightmare alive .  ,1

stan  ollie become saps at sea when their wayward little boat is commandeered by a vicious murderer .  br    br   the boys are wonderful in this feature  which starts out with one of their most hilarious set pieces  the horn factory . always a few steps out of sync with the rest of creation  laurel  hardy inhabit a world where icy radios  bedded billy goats are the rule  not the exception . with its brief length  the film is more in style with their classic short subjects  which explains its episodic nature .  br    br   only the boys get screen credit  but movie mavens will recognize other familiar faces james finlayson appears as a loony doctor  richard cramer does full justice to his bad guy role  sweet mary gordon plays the boys  perplexed neighbor . that  s charlie hall as the apartment house desk clerk and silent screen comic ben turpin portrays a most peculiar plumber .  br    br   one of the film  s script writers was silent comedian harry langdon .  br    br   stan  ollie are the main focus  however . watching hardy go berserk at the sound of a horn  or laurel  s antics with bananas  for instance  reminds the viewer why these fellows remain absolute cinematic giants .  ,1
man  what a scam this turned out to be  not because it wasn  t any good  as i wasn  t really expecting anything from it  but because i was misled by the dvd sleeve which ignorantly paraded its  stars  as being stuart whitman  stella stevens and tony bill . sure enough  their names did not appear in the film  s opening credits  much less themselves in the rest of it   as it turned out  the only movie which connects those three actors together is the equally obscure las vegas lady        but what that one has to do with the crater lake monster is anybody  s guess  br    br   even so  since i paid   .   for its rental and i was in a monster  movie mood anyhow  i elected to watch the movie regardless and  yup  it stunk  apart from the fact that it had a no  name cast and an anonymous crew  an unmistakably amateurish air was visible from miles away and the most i could do with it is laugh at the jaws  like pretensions and  intentionally so  at the resistible antics of two moronic layabouts  cum  boat owners who frequently squabble among themselves with the bemused local sheriff looking on . the creature itself  a plesiosaur i . e . half  dinosaur  half  fish  is imperfectly realized  naturally  but  as had been the case with the giant claw       which i  ve also just seen  this didn  t seem to bother the film  makers none as they flaunt it as much as they can  especially during the movie  s second half   ,0
for all of you that don  t speak swedish the swedish original title of this film  rnarna  translates into something in the line of  the robbers  . this fact is the main problem i have with the film  cause it  s not really about the robbers at all . it  s about a young woman working for the swedish police researching robberies . a regular desk job one would think  but this girl is soon out on the field taking matters into her own hands  as the story goes  even shooting one of the robbers . . . exactly we  ve seen this before . the fact that there  s a rather interesting twist to the plot halfway through doesn  t really help as the ending is just as clich as the first two thirds of the film .  br    br   what saves it from being just another mainstream film is the fact that it  s masterfully executed in all ways  that the actors are as great as they are and don  t overact and that the director really manages to keep it as thrillingly exciting as it is for the most of the story .  br    br   one thing that i really loved about this film is the fact that it  s music sets the right mood when it  s needed  but is absent for the rest of the time  which gives a nice sense of reality to the shootouts and car  chases spread throughout the film . a nice touch  the fact that michael persbrandt is one of the few swedish actors that often tend to get typecasted sadly hurts the film as you know that he  s not going to just play the boyfriend of the heroine and be a supporting character in the background  but that  s something you have to neglect .  br    br   all in all it  s an entertaining film that steals more money in it  s plot than time from you .      ,1
this is an excellent movie . as a canadian who grew up with a rural lifestyle much of it is familiar  the winter  canoeing  trapping  hunting and the like . it is easy to take the familiar for granted but after watching this film a few times it has grown on me .  br    br   the story of grey owl is well known to many canadians credit to director attenborough and screenplay writer nicholson for expanding the story .  br    br   brosnan does well portraying a complex man  a very fine performance . annie galipeau is lovely in her first large role . the rest of the cast is solid .  ,1
there have been far too few mainstream films set in post  colonial africa  and the ones that have are a mixed bunch . this one  with its altruistic pretensions to expose slavery in the     s  shows the best and worst values of africa  which turn out not to be too different to the values of humanity as a whole . it also has shortcomings  given the undue influence of western pre  conceptions of africans and  especially  arabs .  br    br   dr anansa linderby  the beautiful african  american wife of the english doctor david linderby  is captured by arab slave  traders  along with a teenage sanufu girl and a young boy . the lead slave  trader  suleiman  is every bit the stage arab  with his flowery and sometimes humorous rhetoric  and gestures to match  which would not be out of place on  carry on follow that camel  but are not up the standard this film deserves . peter ustinov of course had more than enough skills to address some of the shortcomings of the script  and he rescued what could otherwise have been a woeful one  dimensional character .  br    br   continuing the stereotypical theme  all three of suleiman  s arab employees are unintelligent and one has paedophilic tendencies towards the boy  which thankfully are not portrayed on the screen .  br    br   one of david  s first ports of call is the local police officer  a stereotypical pompous and incompetent african bureaucrat . david then meets two stereotypical white ex  pats  an englishman  walker  played by rex harrison  and an american  sandell  played by william holden  . sandell is a mercenary with  conventional  views on mixed  race relationships  who initially refuses to help unless david provides payment up front . won over by david  s love for anansa  and conscious of his own inability to find love  he agrees to take david up in his helicopter to help search for anansa . they find suleiman and his captives crossing the border and are unable to pursue them into the neighbouring territory  as a result of sandell  s hesitation and david  s lack of experience with firearms  his helicopter is shot down but david survives .  br    br   we then see david introduced to malik  kabir bedi   an african who has lost his family to suleiman and is now only driven by vengeance . they find the sanufu girl with a group of tuareg and know they are on the right track to find suleiman .  br    br   in one of the most heart  rending scenes they kill a party of slave traders only to find that it was not suleiman  s group  and have no choice but to send their captives to the tuaregs they met earlier .  br    br   later on we discover that the young boy who had been raped is a witch doctor and  in an excellent scene with supernatural overtones  he uses his knowledge to kill one of suleiman  s henchmen . anansa on her part  and despite the scepticism of the boy  manages to engineer the demise of suleiman  s two other employees .  br    br   by this time suleiman and his slaves are within days of reaching the slave market .  br    br   suleiman  now in no doubt that anansa is  trouble   attempts to sell her to an obscenely wealthy arab prince  omar sharif  who is corrupt but intelligent . on discovering that anansa is an american working for the u . n .  the prince rather unwisely decides to carry on with the bargaining without considering the consequences . the scene where the two men haggle is one of the best in the film .  br    br   at the slave market  the young boy is sold to a middle  aged german paedophile  and we are left to guess whether the boy will still be considered  wunderbar  when his owner is on the receiving end of his witch  doctoring skills .  br    br   david and malik finally confront suleiman and there is a bitter  sweet ending from malik  s point of view .  br    br   ultimately  david and anansa are re  united  and malik  whose life is in ruins  can console himself with having seen the task he set himself completed .  br    br   the overall plot of the film is excellent but it loses marks for its stereotypical portrayal of nearly all the leading characters . credit must go to all the leading actors for addressing many of the shortcomings of the scripting .  ,1
this rather formulaic swords and flying fists movie is a decent early display of john woo  s talents . the cinematography is excellent and some of the sword work is truly remarkable . unfortunately the film labours under the burden of a dull story and a glaringly low budget  check some of the setbound fight scenes if you doubt me  . nonetheless  it  s worth seeing  especially if you can catch in letterboxed .  ,0
the thief of bagdad is a treasure . first and foremost  it is a good story . though my four children  s primary exposure to this tale  the most famous of the stories of the arabian nights  comes from the disney corporation  the thief of bagdad held their interest to the end . the story moves along at a good pace and includes a twist or two that reduced predictability . sabu  who plays the young thief  abu  also measures up to any of today  s teen actors in appeal  judging from the number of times i heard my oldest daughter say   he  s c  u  t  e    br    br   in      the film won oscars for cinematography and special effects . today  of course  those effects seem very dated   look  it  s barbie flying through the air   declared my daughter at the sight of the genie flying  . yet they fit into the story well . the film is  after all  over   years old . the effects fit with the script . furthermore  what ones sees in the thief of bagdad remained pretty much state  of  the  art for the next twenty  five years . one need only compare the opening montage from a     star trek episode to see this . in that  it was quite an achievement .  br    br   this qualifies as a family film  though there are a few stabbings near the end . the acting is so obvious and the wounds so bloodless as to those scenes nearly as artificial as animation .  br    br   all in all  a fun film worth watching for either an evening of pure entertainment  or for the historical value of the effects . i recommend it .  ,1
actually this movie was not so bad . it contains action  comedy and excitement . there are good actors in this film  for instance doug hutchison  percy from  the green mile    who plays bristol . another well known actor is jamie kennedy  from  scream  and  three kings  . the main characters are played by jamie foxx as alvin  who was pretty good and also funny  but the one who most surprised me  was david morse as edgar clenteen . he plays a different character than he usually does  because in other films like  the green mile    indian runner    the negotiator  or  the langoliers  he plays a very sympathetic person  and in  bait  the plays almost the opposite  a man without any emotions  which was nice to see . the only really negative thing about this film  are the several pictures of the world trade center  which makes this film perhaps look a little dated . overall i thought this was a pretty good little film   ,1
diane keaton gave an outstanding performance in this rather sad but funny story which involved quite a few young people and their deep dark secrets . diane keaton   natalie    the family stone       who had an only daughter and loved her beyond words can describe . she always called her and told her   surrender dorothy   which was an expression used in the  wizard of oz       . a sudden car accident occurs and natalie gets herself deeply involved with her daughter  s friends and lovers . as natalie investigates  the more truths she finds out about herself and her real relationship with her daughter . great film to view and enjoy  especially all the good acting from all the supporting actors .  ,1
the premise was intriguing  but sadly this film just doesn  t do any justice to it . the casting was quite good  and it was shot beautifully  but stylistically much of the direction was inconsistent  overstylized fast editing been there done that to no effect . . . . i was waiting for steven bochco to run in the credits followed by a commercial   characters were identified exclusively by on  screen coke usage  and pretty much everything else left to boogie nights for character development   and no personable characters to draw the viewer into the story . a very forgettable film .  ,0
okay  now  i know there are millions of americans who believe in the rapture that moment when all people born again in christ will be raptured up to meet god and all the rest of humanity will be left on earth to perish in plagues and fire and the heartbreak of psoriasis as the antichrist battles it out with jesus  in an uncharacteristically warlike mode  . and i know the books were best sellers . . . among believers  anyway . and i mean no disrespect to all that .  br    br   but i have to say  they stuffed this movie into a sack and beat it with the suck stick .  br    br   i  m sure the books are much better . really .  br    br   the plot needs no reprising . if you  ve watched this movie  chances are you read the book . i may be one of the only people on earth who actually watched this just for the sheer bad  moving  making experience  and i wasn  t disappointed . especially not by kirk cameron  the creepy little  growing pains  gremlin  who came of age on that show  found christ  and decided that the show should reflect his christian values . well  kirk  your career has gone to the dogs  but now you can be happy that you  re spreading the word of god in movies so bad  they never even make it to theatrical release . well  that  s not strictly true i guess this was the only movie ever made that went to dvd first  with a voucher for a free viewing of the movie when it was briefly released in theaters  i still have the voucher  how many people do you suppose showed up  i don  t know about you  but it never came to my town . of course  i live in nyc  where we godless liberals sit around tearing pages out of the bible and use them to roll joints . so there you go . in fact  i  ll bet out of three million people on manhattan island  not one would be raptured .  br    br   check out the supplementary materials on the dvd  where you  ll learn the creepy behind the scenes details of these movies . . . the cast and crew all must be of the same religious mindset . they don  t come right out and say this  but listen closely to what the filmmakers say . it  s like a bunch of pod people got together to make a pod movie . how creepazoid is that  honestly  this stuff just preaches to the converted  doesn  t it  can you imagine anyone who doesn  t subscribe to the whole apocalypse thing watching this  slapping his forehead and saying   holy hoover dam  i better get saved pronto   anyhow  i  m hooked . i gotta see the rest of these christian fiasco movies  especially the one with gary busey  which i think is tribulations . at least busey has an excuse for taking the part . . . . he cracked his head on some pavement when he crashed his motorcycle .  br    br   oy .  br    br   oh  and one more thing . what  s with all the shots of poor  innocent dogs whimpering  their leashes dragging uselessly along the ground  because their owners have been called to heaven  what  s up with that  are we supposed to feel badly for the dogs  and if we do  what are we to make of god  doesn  t it irk people that there  s no room in heaven for man  s best friend  foo .  br    br   this is one more reason i  m agnostic . good night and good luck .  ,0
possibly the most brilliant thing about che part two  as we begin to integrate it with part one in our minds  is that there is no clarification of why che chose to confidentially abscond from cuba after the revolution  no allusion to his experience in the congo  no clarification of why he chose bolivia as his subsequent setting for a coup d  etat  no allusion to the political decisions he made as a young man motorcycling across south america  which walter salles has given prominent familiarity . extraordinary focus is given to che meeting the volunteers who accompany his guerrilla factions . yet hardly any endeavor is made to single them out as individuals  to establish involved relationships . he is reasonably unreasonable . che drives an unbreakable doctrine to leave no wounded man behind . but there is no feeling that he is deeply directly concerned with his men . it is the concept .  br    br   in part   in cuba  the rebels are welcomed by the people of the villages  given food and cover  supported in what grows to be a victorious revolution . here  in bolivia  not much understanding is apparent . villagers expose him . they protect government troops  not his own . when he expounds on the onesidedness of the government medical system  his audience appears uninterested . you cannot lead a people into revolution if they do not want to comply . soderbergh shows u . s . military advisers working with the bolivians  but doesn  t fault the united states for che  s collapse . che seems to have just misfigured his fight and the place where he wanted to have it .  br    br   in showcasing both wars  soderbergh doesn  t build his battle scenes as actions with specific results . che  s men attack and are attacked . they exchange fire with faraway assailants . there is generally a cut to the group in the aftershock of combat  its death toll not paused for . this is not a war movie . it is about one man  s reasonably unreasonable drive to endure . there is no elaborate cinematography . soderbergh looks firmly at che  s inflexible dedication . there are remarkable sporadic visceral shots  but being few they are all the more powerful  such as che  s pov shot during his final beats . there is an abundance of the terrain  where these men live for weeks at a time  and the all  consuming effect is of languor  guevara himself having malaria part of the time .  br    br   benicio del toro  one of the film  s producers  gives a champion  s performance  not least because it  s modest . he isn  t portrayed as the cutting edge like most epic heroes . in cuba  he arises in conquest  in bolivia  he falls to the reverse  and occasionally is actually difficult to distinguish behind a tangle of beard and hair . del toro illustrates not so much an identity as an attitude . you may think the film is too long . i think there  s a genuine cause for its breadth . guevara  s affairs in cuba and particularly bolivia was not a sequence of episodes and sketches  but an undertaking of staying power that might virtually be called insane . in the end  che as a whole or in parts is a commercially ballsy movie  one where its director begins by understanding the limits innate in cinematic biography and working progressively within those means .  ,1
the movie confuses religious ethics and ideals so much that it fails to create coherent argument against the death penalty on any level . by presenting the lawful execution of a convicted murder as the catalyst for the apocalyptic end of mankind the movie elevates a parent killer to the status of martyr for christ . somehow  according to the plot  god is outraged that society has chosen to rid it  s self of a fanatic who killed his own parents by starting them on fire while they slept defenselessly in their beds . yet this same god has no indignation for the acts of the killer . the lead character  an nonreligious pregnant suicidal woman  ultimately gives her own life in a defiant but implausible attempt to unsuccessfully save this convicted killer . in other threads of the underdeveloped plot jesus comes back as a powerless and frustrated vagabond to symbolically unleash the wrath of god . the modern lackluster incarnation of christ not just dehumanizes him but mocks the messianic ideal of all religions as well . he is unable to affect humanity for good and unemotionally skates the edges of life waiting for mankind to destroy it  s self . meanwhile  with little help from jesus the mentally unstable pregnant woman finds herself with the ability to reincarnate herself into her newly born soulless child which somehow saves all of mankind from the wrath of the almighty . i also interpreted that as a statement in support of abortion on some levels . this movie which attempts to weave many religious themes into a thriller fails to make any religious point that i could clearly interpret except to mock people  s beliefs . it raises many questions that it never even attempts to answer . it disregards the religious values of its audience while attempting to portray an asinine version of their fulfillment . silly  ,0
seeing as the vote average was pretty low  and the fact that the clerk in the video store thought it was  just ok   i didn  t have much expectations when renting this film .  br    br   but contrary to the above  i enjoyed it a lot . this is a charming movie . it didn  t need to grow on me  i enjoyed it from the beginning . mel brooks gives a great performance as the lead character  i think somewhat different from his usual persona in his movies .  br    br   there  s not a lot of knockout jokes or something like that  but there are some rather hilarious scenes  and overall this is a very enjoyable and very easy to watch film .  br    br   very recommended .  ,1
monika mitchell  s showbiz satire has some laughs and some premeditated violence . i wouldn  t say blood  soaked but there is insult and injury . max matteo  john cassini  is a character actor that has a quirky adaptable presence on screen  but he has a terrible track record of being chosen for the parts he goes after . there is always a producer  s nephew or seemingly trivial reason for his not being awarded the role he seeks . well  the best thing to do is get rid of the competition . . . max becomes obsessed with such thoughts . the rewarding career is just a swing  push and shot away . other cast members rene rivera  molly parker  jennifer beals  frank cassini and cameos by eric roberts and sandra oh . well  that  s show business . . . or is it   ,0

ahh  talespin  what can i say that hasn  t already been said about this great show  nothing  this is without a doubt one of the most well  written shows i  ve ever encountered  live  action or animation . the newer stuff is way too dumbed down for my tastes  and some of the  mature  stuff i have to shoo kids out of the room for . but not talespin .  br    br   the stories are engaging and very plausible . some of them could even be stretched out to an hour or two for a movie . episodes like stormy weather and her chance to dream are very dramatic while still being enjoyable for kids and adults alike . then there are the pure comedy episodes such as the bluest of the baloo bloods and stuck on you  where the emphasis is on hilarity . i can laugh myself to tears in a few choice ones .  br    br   the drama aspect is very lacking in most shows nowadays  at least  those which aren  t specifically geared toward it   especially in cartoons . in the episode stormy weather for instance  kit cloudkicker decides that he  s going to join an air circus  but baloo believes that it would be too dangerous . in the biggest fight of the episode  baloo yells at kit to stay away from daring dan  to which kit screams  no  you can  t tell me what to do  your  re not my dad   and buries his face in his pillow . the next day he leaves for the air circus . this kind of drama is a rarity in a cartoon  and would be most welcome in the ones created nowadays .  br    br   the characters have a lot of depth to them . baloo is pretty much the way he is in the jungle book  plus or minus a few degrees of laziness . rebecca is a cunning business woman whose ideas on getting money  while good in theory  are seldom good in practice . molly is a cute little girl  but you can  t let that deceive you . she can be a real hellion sometimes . kit cloudkicker is a darker character than the rest . he doesn  t trust adults much unless they appeal to him  and he has a tendency to break off relationships . watch his expression in plunder and lightning when he grabs the grappling hook he looks as though he  s prepared to put it right through a pirate .  br    br   in the end  it  s the drama combined with the very real chemistry between the characters that makes this show   in my book . the relationship between baloo and kit is very real  almost father and son . this is demonstrated well in all  s whale that ends whale when baloo takes kit  s word for it that seymour is abusing the animals in his aquarium instead of siding with the other adults . baloo and becky  s relationship is also realistic  due to baloo  s motivation for working comes from wanting to buy back the ol  sea duck  not necessarily a desire to help rebecca . but something tells me that if he did get the duck back he  d still do jobs for rebecca .  br    br   the sea duck  not to mention all the other planes in the series  is pretty realistically designed . the plane  s functions don  t change once throughout the series  continuity like that is hard to come by also   and unlike most other  super  planes  of other cartoons  it doesn  t have one single weapon on board  unless you count mangoes    and relies instead on it  s cunning pilot  s great skill to get out of trouble . it  s hard to think of a hero vehicle that doesn  t have some sort of gun turret  laser cannon  or even a handgun somewhere on board . and the fact that they use their heads to get out of trouble is so hard to find in a cartoon nowadays . plus it  s just such a darn cool design   br    br   this is definitely the best cartoon . ever . period . definitely worth all ten stars   ,1
i am a big      s movie fan and will watch most anything that i see on turner classic movies thats new for me . so i gave this a shot  after all it  s the great harold lloyd who rivaled chaplin as a great silent film comedian . i have watched much less of lloyd  s silent films then of chaplins but i have to say i  m a much bigger chaplin fan . anyway this film fell so flat for me that i didn  t finish it . i can understand why his sound career was so limited  he didn  t get very good material to work with . after you  ve seen chaplin  abbott and costello  the three stooges  martin and lewis  the marx brothers  and laurel and hardy do boxing spoofs  or violence in general   this one is very forgettable . i was also interested in watching adolphe menjou as i really enjoyed him in paths of glory but his role here also did nothing special for me . maybe they should have gotten into the boxing sooner because at least half the film  at least it seemed that way  is before he gets in a ring . i can tell there are a lot of lloyd fans here and this wont be a popular review but i must rate this as compared to what else was out there at the time   out of   . don  t watch this with anyone your trying to get to like old movies as they may not watch another one with you again  very flat . for an alternative to anyone who really liked this or is looking for more little known comedies in general i recommend  kelly the second  made a few years earlier  another nobody becomes a boxer comedy with patsy kelly and in a supporting role charles chase . these have both been shown on the turner classic movies channel .  ,0
shakespeare behind bars was the most surprising and delightful film i  ve seen all year . it  s about a prison program  somewhere in california if i recall correctly  where the inmates have rehearsed and performed a different shakespeare play every year for the past   years . the film follows their production of  the tempest  from casting through performance  and in the process we learn some pretty amazing things about these men  who are all in for the most serious of crimes . truth is indeed stranger than fiction   if anyone tried to adapt this story into a fiction film  the audience would never buy it  but knowing that it  s real makes it breathtaking to watch   literally i gasped out loud when i learned of one particularly gifted felon  s crime . it  s like some loopy episode of oz  and all the more entertaining because the characters and their bizarre stories are real .  ,1
well  i guess i  ll have to be the one to say  the emperor has no clothes .  when i saw this show listed for pbs last night i was both hopeful and apprehensive . i loved  morse   even going so far as to buy the complete dvd set  and felt that  while i always liked kevin whately  s sgt . lewis character  the show was john thaw  period  after watching the new  inspector lewis   as it is billed here   i am more convinced then ever that i was right . . . whately is fine  even though he looks awful  both badly aged and too fat   but he simply doesn  t have the charisma to carry the show as did thaw .  br    br   and as for his  sidekick  fox  well . . . perhaps the reviewers here from england can understand what he  s saying  but i for one mostly could not .  br    br   as for ms . innocent . . . all i can say is that i miss james grout .  br    br   i  m sorry to say that they should have left  morse  rest in peace .  ,0

i first saw enchanted april about five years ago . i loved it so much that my husband surprised me with a copy the following christmas . it  s about two women who decide to rent a castle in italy for the month of april  leaving their humdrum lives behind them . they are very sad women at the outset of the film  and you can  t help but root them on as they plan this get  away with two other women they invite along to share the expenses . this is perhaps the most feel good movie i have ever seen . it  pure and simple  with no car chases  no animosities and no deaths . it was made with care and in very good taste . you cannot help but smile all through it   except when you  re crying happy tears   ,1
only seen season  so far but this is just great   a wide variety of people stuck on a island . nobody are who they seem to be and everybody seems to have loads of skeletons in their closets . . . . it sounds like melrose place meets the crusoe family and why is that so great  it probably is not but then ad a spoon full of x files  a dose of  what    and a big  hey  and a island that is everything you ever dreamed of  in your freakiest nightmares and you  ll be lost to . the story got so many twists and turns it is unbelievable . great set up  solid acting with a liberating acceptance that at the end of the everybody is human  well almost everybody . . . i think . . .  with good and bad sides . but weird oh so weird . . .  ,1
there are so many reasons as to why i rate the sopranos so highly  one of its biggest triumphs being the cast and character building . each character unfolds more and more each series . also each series has an array of different  small time characters  as well as the main . a good example of a character  who was only in three episodes  who you can feel for is david the compulsive gambler played brilliantly by robert patrick . every little detail builds the perfect tv series . the show revolves round mob boss tony soprano  james gandolfini  who attempts to balance his life of crime with his role as father of two . the show is not afraid to be bold and powerful with its dialogue and imagery and this is what makes it so believable . whilst tony runs things with capos paulie  tony sirico  and silvio  steve van zant  his nephew christopher  michael imperioli  looks for a promotion . every episode also features tony  s other family in some way which includes his children and wife carmela soprano  edie falco  . on top of these problems is his uncle junior soprano  dominic chianese  is trying to get what he can out of tony  s businesses despite being under house arrest . all the acting is powerful and characters complex  but the two who stand out the most are james gandolfini who  is  tony soprano . also michael imperioli who plays christopher  representing the younger        generation in crime . if david chase had not created this masterpiece modern tv dramas of such caliber may not have existed  such as the wire and dexter . so the sopranos is definitely the godfather  goodfellas and pulp fiction of tv  ,1
as an aging rocker  this movie mentions heep and quo  my  favourite bands ever  but with the incredible cast  everyone   and the fantastic storyline  i just love this piece of creative genius . i cannot recommend it more highly  and mick jones added so much  foreigner lead and primary songwriter along with the greatest rock singer ever  lou gramm   i have watched this great work more than   times  bill nighy  what a voice  and jimmy nail  talent oozes from every pore  then astrid . . . . and karen . . . . . what more could an aging rocker ask for         bloody brilliant .  br    br   alastair  perth  western oz  originally from windsor  england .  ,1
  the plainsman  represents the directorial prowess of cecil b . demille at its most inaccurate and un  factual . it sets up parallel plots for no less stellar an entourage than wild bill hickok  gary cooper   buffalo bill cody  james ellison   calamity jane  jean arthur   george armstrong custer and abraham lincoln to interact  even though in reality lincoln was already dead at the time the story takes place . every once in a while demille floats dangerously close toward the truth  but just as easily veers away from it into unabashed spectacle and showmanship . the film is an attempt to buttress custer  s last stand with a heap of fiction that is only loosely based on the lives of people  who were already the product of manufactured stuffs and legends . truly  this is the world according to demille  a zeitgeist in the annals of entertainment  but a pretty campy relic by today  s standards .  br    br   transfer considering the vintage of the film  this is a moderately appealing transfer  with often clean whites and extremely solid blacks . there  s a considerable amount of film grain in some scenes and an absence of it at other moments . all in all  the image quality is therefore somewhat inconsistent  but it is never all bad or all good  just a bit better than middle of the road . age related artifacts are kept to a minimum and digital anomalies do not distract . the audio is mono but nicely balanced .  br    br   extras forget it . it  s universal  bottom line as pseudo  history painted on celluloid  this western is compelling and fun . just take its characters and story with a grain of salt  in some cases  a whole box seems more appropriate   ,1
dooohhh  my bwainn hurrrts  well it certainly does after this endurance test of a film . how on earth i managed to keep going without hitting the fast forward button lord only knows .  br    br   maybe it  s me   maybe i don  t get the premise of the film . . . or maybe i don  t appreciate it  s alleged mystical atmosphere . in my humble opinion though the film has about as much mystical atmosphere as a trip to mcdonalds .  br    br   in addition the characters were all dreadful and there is more character development in a tom  jerry cartoon . yaarrrghhh  why do i do it  why do i watch such tripe  it  s enough to make one run away and join a monastery or the foreign legion   yaargh   an absolutley dreadful film in just about every respect . apart from that it  s not to bad .  ,0

i loved this mini series . tara fitzgerald did an incredible job portraying helen graham  a beautiful young woman hiding  along with her young son  from a mysterious past . as an anglophile who loves romances . . . this movie was just my cup of tea and i would recommend it to anyone looking to escape for a few hours into the england of the      s . i also must mention that toby stephens who portrays the very magnetic gilbert markham is reason enough to watch this wonderful production .  ,1
  it  s like hard to like describe just how like exciting it is like to make a relationship like drama like with all the like pornographic scenes thrown like in for like good measure like  and to stir up like contro  like  versy and make us more like money and like stuff .   ellen  the lost quote .  br    br    kissing  like  on the  like  mouth and stuff  is like the best like artistic endeavor like ever made . watching like ellen  s hairy arms and like chris masturbating was like the height of my years  long movie  viewing experience and stuff . but before i like begin like breaking new u . s .     something  airhead records with the my  likes   let me like just briefly list like the high  like  lights of this visual like feast  br    br    . chris doing the deed with his genitals . and not just that the way the camera  guided so elegantly by ellen and patrick  rewards the viewer with a full  screen shot of chris  s fat white  trash stomach after he finishes the un  catholic deed  that was truly thrilling . i can in all honesty say that i  ve never seen such grace . chris  you should do more such scenes in your next movies  because that is exactly what we needed as a continuation of what that brilliant  brilliant man  lars von trier and his  idiots     started . a quick w and then a hairy  fat  white belly what more can any movie  goer ask for   needless to say  i can sit all day and watch chris ejaculate  in spite of the fact that i  m straight  . . . such poetry in motion . such elegance  such style . no less than total  divine inspiration went into filming that sequence  plus a solid amount of zen philosophy . even barbra streisand could not get any more spiritual than this .  br    br    . ellen  s hairy  thick arms . the wobbly  camera close  ups  so skillfully photographed by our two directors of photography  i can  t emphasize this enough   ellen and patrick  often caused confusion regarding the proper identification of the sex in question . there were several scenes when we would see a part of a body  a leg  arm or foot   yet it was often a guessing game does that body  part belong to a man or a woman  naturally  chris and his fellow artists  ellen  patrick and whatsername  cast themselves on purpose  because their bodies were ideal for creating this gender  based confusion . it was at times hard to guess whether one is seeing a female or male leg . patrick is so very thin and effeminate in his movements  so hairless and pristine  whereas ellen and the other girl are so very butch  what with their thick legs and arms . brilliant .  br    br    . brilliant  especially the way that neatly ties in with the theme of role reversal between the sexes so utterly original and mind  blowing . ellen behaves like a man  wants sex all the time  while her ex patrick wants to talk  like a girl . spiffing .  br    br    . ellen  s search for a leftist mate .  he must love  the simpsons   which is quite leftist .  i am glad that the makers of this movie decided to break the long tradition of offering us intelligent leftists . ellen is such a refreshing  and realistic  change . the number of  likes  that she and her liberal friends manage to utter in less than   minutes is truly phenomenal        to be exact  . they have managed to realistically transfer their real  life ineptness onto the big screen with a minimum of effort  and i applaud them for that .  br    br    . the close  ups of toes . plenty of stuff here for foot  fetishists  which i think is a very liberal  highly commendable way of reaching out to sexual minorities . after all  shoe  and foot  fetishists are offered so little in modern cinema  so it  s nice to see that someone out there cares .  br    br   kotm  or rather  klotlmas  offers more than meets the eye . it is not just a modest little film about shallow people engaging in hollow relationships while indulging in meaningless conversations . no  it  s much more than that . it  s about the light that guides all silly creatures the guiding light that dominates the futile lives of various pseudo  artistic wannabes who just dropped out of film school  and plan to assault our senses with dim  witted drivel that will hopefully play well at pretentious festivals like sundance and cannes  enabling them to gain the necessary exposure hence some real cash for a change  with which they will later hire the likes of sean penn and george clooney in promoting the saving of this planet and the resolving of all political problems this world faces . what better way to do that than by making porn at the very start   br    br   if chris and ellen did the camera here  as is clearly stated in the end  credits  then who held the camera while the two of them were in front of it  they probably hired some passers  by and shoved the camera into their hands . . .  br    br   go to http   rateyourmusic . com  fedor   and check out my  tv  cinema    worst cases of nepotism  list .  ,0
i have to say i am really surprised at the high ratings for this movie . i found it to be absolutely idiotic . the mother gets  visions  when she touches certain things or people  and one thing she touched twice made her vision continue . . . just seemed so ridiculous . deedee pfieffer  s performance was awful i thought . she was very irritating . the girl who played lori did a good job and so did most of the supporting cast for what they had to work with .  br    br   i usually love lmn and am very open minded when it comes to movies but this movie seemed to have a ridiculous plot and over the top acting and it just was not for me .  ,0
i was very displeased with this move . everything was terrible from the start . the comedy was unhumorous  the action overdone  the songs unmelodious . even the storyline was weightless . from a writer who has written successful scripts like guru and dhoom  i had high expectations . the actors worked way too hard and did not help the film at all . of course  kareena rocked the screen in a bikini but for two seconds . i think hindi stunt directors should research how action movies are done . they tend to exaggerate way too much . in chinese films  this style works because that is their signature piece . but  hindi cinema  s signature are the songs . a good action movie should last no more than two hours and cannot look unrealistic . but  in the future  i  m sure these action movies will get much sharper . also to be noted comedy and action films do not mix unless done properly . good luck next time .  ,0
going down as the most expensive film in finnish history  to date   dark floors  is a horror film with an extremely lynchian narrative that recounts an ever increasingly decrepit series of  floors   ironically enough  in an abandoned hospital  in which our protagonists are trapped . lead by an autistic daughter and her father  himself disenchanted with the hospitals apparent lack of medical progress with his daughter  make their way into an elevator debating the issue with one of the hospitals nurses . accompanied by a security guard  a businessman and a seemingly intoxicated tramp the collective soon find the complex abandoned  but they are not alone . directed by finnish  born pete riski  more known for his television work   dark floors  is filmed in english  using mainly english actors but has the notable inclusion of finland  s arguably most famous group  lordi       eurovision song contest winners  as themselves  i . e . in their on stage monstrous costumes  as the films antagonists  yet for all this razzmatazz the production fails where it is needed most  in convincing the audience .  br    br   any film that has their lead character use the phrase  it  s too quiet  is already headed down a dubious path  and this lordi influenced horror does not break that convention . for all the good ideas that are thrown into the mix there are a handful of ripe clichs alongside and worst of all  anything that is interestingly original isn  t fleshed out enough for it to resonate . the concept of the degrading floors is initially highly ominous and does provide a sense of inevitable doom as the audience is aware those trapped in the hospital must progress ever further down in the mire . however  there isn  t enough atmosphere created to scare and intimidate the audiences into the unknowing fear  the viewer is aware the journey will become ever more dangerous  as the levels degenerate from shiny white through to hellish black  but i don  t think the characters are aware enough of this fact for it to be threatening . also  the entire film taking place in what is essentially its own time bubble is again a very nice touch  a concept not often used in the horror genre  but the characters don  t confront the situation with enough fear and trepidation when they stumble across this fact  they continue about their business far too readily and without enough genuine concern for the idea to mean anything to the audience . these initially good ideas are just left to go to waste  as if the director and  or mr lordi  who had many of the ideas used within the film  had these thoughts  but couldn  t agree or decide on how to best use them and as such lose their purpose and point .  br    br   yet for all the frustration there are large quantities of comedy  yet not for the reasons the creators would have hoped for . too much is clichd  too much is recycled and too much is just simply ridiculous . while the lead is amicably acted by noah huntley  the characters are mere cardboard cut outs that have been pasted into the story from other films . we have a lead man doing everything possible to protect his daughter alongside a clunkily developed love interest . accompanying the  couple  we have the traditional token black man as a hard  nosed security guard  with the nigh on infinite clip for his sidearm  and a weasely disbelieving businessman only on the look out for himself . worst of all though  unfortunately  is the introduction of the cast of lordi as the creatures of the night that torment our wandering band of misfits  but not for them appearing as themselves . what makes a horror film scary to the viewing audience is contextualising the fear .  the shining  is scary because it  s a member of your own family hounding you  in  dawn of the dead  it  s our fear of each other and the primordial cannibalism and irrational thought patterns the zombies possess  in  alien  the fear is explained  the creature is rationalised and in  dark floors  there is none of that . perhaps it  s unfair to compare this production to these monoliths of the genre but when you do it shows it pales significantly and that it  s aggressors feel like nothing more than demented klingons where you can almost see the zip on the costumes they wear  without a build up of any atmosphere  lordi  just aren  t scary .  br    br   it  s infuriating because we all cheer for the underdog and hope they do well  you want the smaller productions to say that they can create the same quality of film as  hollywood  churns out  much in the similar way that george a romero started out  but it doesn  t always materialise . i enjoyed the film and didn  t feel as if i had wasted the ninety minutes i had just sat through  but i felt enjoyment on a completely hollow level as if nothing that had occurred mattered or affected me subconsciously  emotionally or critically . i felt the almost lynchian narrative was a standout plus point  but it fades out into nothingness . why did it happen  what does it mean  will they go through this all again  without even the slightest insight into what will happen the film is simply puzzling for the sake of trying to be arty . was the entire sequence of events real or was it merely a dream sequence  had the autistic girl watched the eurovision song contest of     and simply had a highly bizarre nightmare given the stress she was under  who knows  and unfortunately i fail to work up the energy to even care .  dark floors  is an infuriating experience that while ultimately shallow hallmarks potential and at the very least shows a plethora of creative energies from mr lordi  who perhaps should look into working solo to fully develop his ideas . it  s one that fans of the group or the genre should perhaps pursue but will leave you feeling left in the lurch for not having enough light shed on the situation .  ,0
mercifully  there  s no video of this wannabe western that a stay  afloat vehicle for big frank at a time when his career was floundering . the story of a weasel who lives on the reputation of his big gun brother and who gets run out of town by bad guys only to return to rally his townfolks with a new found courage must have been written by a back  room writer . all in all  this show stinks . the story is basically boring  ill  conceived and so naive that it can offend your intelligence . i must depart complete from the other reviewer who found it  . . . underrated . . .  the critics slammed it at the time and deservedly so . you  ll have to catch it on the last show  if you up late and having a bout of insomnia . but  if you can sit through it  you  ve more fortitude than most of my movie buff friends .  ,0
this movie is so  so  so horrible  that it makes angels lose their wings . shaq had tried to make other crossover efforts  like his work in shaq  fu for the nes and his plethora of unbearable rap albums  and later  the epic serving of horrible film  making that is steel .  br    br   there  s not a single good thing to be said about this movie . i saw it a bunch of times when i was very young  but i must  ve been an idiot then  because this movie takes all that is enjoyable about films and tears it apart . it  s fun to mock . i saw it on the disney channel a while back and spent a few minutes doing that . although  once the thrill of mocking it is done  you still become overwhelmed by its terribleness .  br    br   if you see it on tv  try this consider  as your watching the film  removing from it all the scenes in which shaq uses his magical genie powers . if you do that  it becomes like a film about a pedophile chasing a kid and rapping to seduce him . that  s kinda funny  and disturbing .  br    br   a horrible example of film . do not  unless looking to mock it  see this movie .  ,0
it  s good to see that vintage film buff have correctly categorized their excellent dvd release as a  musical   for that  s what this film is  pure and simple . like its unofficial remake  murder at the windmill        the murder plot is just an excuse for an elaborate girlie show with kitty carlisle and gertrude michael leading a cast of super  decorative girls including ann sheridan  lucy ball  beryl wallace  gwenllian gill  gladys young  barbara fritchie  wanda perry and dorothy white . carl brisson is also on hand to lend his strong voice to  cocktails for two  . undoubtedly the movie  s most popular song  it is heard no less than four times . however  it  s gertrude michael who steals the show  not only with her rendition of  sweet marijauna  but her strong performance as the hero  s rejected girlfriend . as for the rest of the cast  we could have done without jack oakie and victor mclaglen altogether . the only good thing about oakie  s role is his weak running gag with cult icon  toby wing . in fact  to give you an idea as to how far the rest of the comedy is over  indulged and over  strained  super  dumb inspector mclaglen simply cannot put his hands on the killer even though  would you believe  in this instance it happens to be the person you most suspect . director mitch leisen actually goes to great pains to point the killer out to even the dumbest member of the cinema audience by giving the player concerned close  up after close  up .  ,1

this movie is a disgrace to the major league franchise . i live in minnesota and even i can  t believe they dumped cleveland .  yes i realize at the time the real indians were pretty good  and the twins had taken over their spot at the bottom of the american league  but still be consistent .  anyway i loved the first major league  liked the second  and always looked forward to the third  when the indians would finally go all the way to the series . you can  t tell me this wasn  t the plan after the second film was completed . what happened  anyways if your a true fan of the original major league do yourself a favor and don  t watch this junk .  ,0
the most important thing about this movie is the brilliant performance by daniel day  lewis and hugh o  conor as christy brown  guineas artist and fighter who despite of her physical condition overcame all the odds . as a person who did work with patients with cerebral palsy  i can assure you that their performance were shockingly convincing . the enormous support that christy got form his family  low  income  working class dubliners  encouraged him to do the impossible and this picture depicted this support brilliantly have not read the book  but the dialogs were written wisely to capture christy brown  s witty arrogant personality . i do recommend this movie to everyone  especially to classic movie  lovers .  ,1
yes it may be goofy and may not seem as funny as many high budget comedies out there  but this movie is truly hilarious if you really watch it . tim meadows has always struck me as being funny off of the saturday night live show . whenever he would do this character on the show i would crack up laughing . so after i saw this was going to be playing on comedy central one night i decided to check it out . all in all i was farily impressed with this movie  because it wasn  t meant to win any oscars or become comedy of the year  but it did entertain the saturday night live fans that love the ladies man character . this movie is also packed with some highly quotable lines that can be recited for years to come .  ,1
before seeing this movie  i would  ve said that i loved everything kathy bates has done . now it  s everything  minus  one . james woods is pathetic . . . not his character  his acting . someone should  ve told him that  poor  is not synonymous with dirty  nor ignorant  nor cliche . ditto for randy quaid  s stereotyping . the only redeeming feature is henry thomas  who isn  t a strong enough actor to carry this sodden mess . if you enjoy the country  you  ll enjoy the scenery . that  s the best i can give it .  br    br   i  m a serious fan of both independent and quirky films  but this is simply terrible .  ,0
this movie was just as good as some of the other westerns made by anthony mann and james stewart like winchester    and the naked spur  and much better than thunder bay and bend of the river . this film starts out like a run of the mill western but gets more complex as it goes along . it starts out with jimmy stewart and walter brennan arriving in seattle and stewart is charged with murder . he is found innocent but is cattle is stolen by a corrupt judge . stewart then agrees to lead something but i forget what it is but stewart only cares about getting his cattle back . as the movie goes along it  s like stewart only cares about himself just like his character in the naked spur . it gets much better at the halfway point after they arrive in alaska . this is one of stewart  s better westerns .  ,1
this is one the few movies i can watch over and over . if you  ve never seen it  give it a shot . richard dreyfus and raoul julia are wonderful together and although the movie amuses me greatly  it reminds me of julia  s untimely demise . it is a good opportunity to sit back and laugh at the international intrigue that is too much with us in these time of terror and fear .  ,1
horrible acting  bad story line  cheesy makeup  and this is just the tip of the iceberg . i have never seen a worse movie in my life   minutes in i decided to fast forward to see if anything redeeming would happen . . . it didn  t .  aside from a nice breast shot  the movie apparently was filmed in some furniture warehouse  and the same warehouse was used for at least    of the sets . you even see this same red chair in several different  locations  if you are going to make a film at least rent an office building and an apartment  not some warehouse which will echo all your actor  s dialog . .  note to producers  renting a small office space and an apartment for a month is much cheaper than an entire warehouse  and both are quite a bit more versatile and believable  if you spend your money to rent this people i hope you got it with a return guarantee . . . you will be demanding your money back . . . i only spent   .   to rent this tonight and i feel ripped off .  ,0

david chase  s  the sopranos  is perhaps the most over  praised television show in recent memory . not only is the series devoid of intellect and passion  it  s devoid of a soul . as anyone reading likely knows already  james gandolfini is tony soprano  a big  fat ahole of a mob boss with a spoiled btch of a wife  and two bratty  sht  brained kids living in  you guessed it  the armpit of america  that  s new jersey  by the way  . not only is tony a womanizing adulterer  he  s also an unrepentant murdering scumbag  with a crew of  saturday night live  skit  worthy caricatures for subordinates . it  s not the fact that tony is a piece of sht mobster that offends me  and apparently only me  . allowing characters to be who and what they are  without judgment  is something american tv hardly allows . but chase  and his entourage of money  gorged  emmy  gored writers  have not simply allowed us to observe tony and his crew as they behave  nor have they even attempted to provide any insight into the action  reaction reality of  even obviously fictionalized  organized crime  a la  the godfather   . instead  chase glorifies and endorses his characters  greedy  violent  and corrupt lifestyle in the same way that tony  his wife  and even his hair  brained psychologist do week after week  or should i say month after month . or is it year after year  it seems like the show  s paltry    episode seasons come out with the same regularity as a lunar eclipse  . much has been made of the series  refusal to adhere to  network  structure  with plot lines that go nowhere  and characters that pop  up and disappear like backyard vermin . but if the show is so brilliant in its lack of structure  why does it always feel like i  m watching a soap  opera  tired mob clichs  bored housewives  self  serving  irredeemable characters and plots that go nowhere . more than ever  i can see why so many americans of italian heritage are pssed at this show . it  s enough to make you want to curl up with a good book  dant  s  inferno  springs to mind  .  br    br   people on imdb love to claim that there  s nothing good on television  and therefore  the sopranos  is a breath of fresh air . are these same people too busy paying their cable bills to watch  the shield    it  s included in basic  ya know  . how about the  still good   the west wing   or the brilliantly acted  if erratically written   boston legal   what about possibly the best comedy of the last few decades   arrested development   and lest we forget that we live in an age of dvds  nobody has to watch anything new . i  d much rather shell out    for an over  priced boxed set of  well  pretty much anything  than give hbo    a month  or    a dvd set   to continue to prove how much of a hack  factory it can be .  br    br   you want good television  watch  homicide life on the street .  or  murder one  . or  picket fences  . or even chase  s prior show   northern exposure .  if you  re already among  the sopranos   s legion of brain  washed fans and critics  it  s too late for you . but if not  leave tony and his worthless kin where they all belong  rotting with the fishes .   sleeping  would be way too kind   ,0
although this film is somewhat sanitized  because it was made at a time when people just didn  t talk about sex   it is an extremely helpful short film to show prepubescent girls so they know what to expect during menstruation . not surprisingly  it was paid for by the kotex company  though what may surprise many is that disney made this film   as they made a lot of educational films during the     s    s . however well made the film is  though  i think the film maker  s missed a real opportunity . instead of the nice female narrator  s voice and the relatively bland visuals it would have been great if they  d used minnie mouse and the rest of the disney gang   i know this would have given old walt a heart attack  but wow that would have been a great film  by the way  although the notion of sex is barely hinted at in the film  it does adequately explain menstruation in general . however  it does lack some details  especially about intercourse  that i assume were included in the accompanying booklet .  br    br   now if only i can figure out why i watched a cartoon about menstruation .  ,1
i first saw this when they showed this around easter time       and didn  t think much of it then  i bought this on dvd last summer when i started getting into michael jackson  i liked his music before  and enjoyed it more now i am older . it is a good film but it won  t be this classic film like the sound of music  west side story  the wizard of oz etc . michael jackson as an actor was good and so were the other cast members . there were a disturbing scenes like the little girl katie getting slapped by the gangster frankie lideo who was played by joe pesci . the scene that frightened me when i was younger was when michael turns into a robot . my favourite song on the film was smooth criminal i think it was better than thriller in my opinion .  ,1
gene hackman gets himself busted out of prison by a nameless government agency who want him for an assassination . it  s a given of course that hackman has the proficient skills for the job .  br    br   nobody tells him anything though  he  s given as the audience is given bits and pieces of information . that  s supposed to be suspenseful  instead it  s annoying and boring .  br    br   hackman goes through with the mission  but the getaway is messed up and the guy at the top of this mysterious entity orders everybody dead to cover it up . so everyone in the cast dies and at the end you don  t really care .  br    br   one of the other reviewers pointed out that the film was originally twice as long  almost three hours and got chopped down quite a bit . maybe something really was lost in the translation  but i tend to think it was a mercy act on the audience .  br    br   a very talented cast that had people like richard widmark  candice bergen  mickey rooney  eli wallach  and edward albert is so thoroughly wasted here it  s a crime .  br    br   and we never do find out just what federal agency was doing all this  the fbi  the cia  the dea or even the irs .  ,0
i can  t believe i wasted my time with this movie . i couldn  t even call it a movie . it was so bad with nothing to recommend it .  br    br   i like low budget movies and weird flicks but this one had me bored to death . badly made and bad acting ruined it from being curious . you have to wonder what these people were thinking when they spent money to produce this movie . i wonder what i was thinking watching it to the end . i recommend this movie to no one . how did they release this  was there an audience who likes this kind of movie  there must be because you can find this at almost any video store . but why   br    br   deserves to be forgotten .  br    br   if you like bad movies then this is for you .  ,0
i have seen bad films but this took the p . made no sense  and all the characters do is swear every couple of seconds  oh and i think one has a low sperm count . its that good . a welshman plays a sweary cockney . a posh english bloke plays a foul mouthed unlovable rogue of a paddy  and some lesser lights play dim tarts .  br    br   and there are some russian gangsters . oh yes some one has a gun and maybe talks rubbish whilst high on drugs .  br    br   avoid this film like the plague .  ,0
i love it when they actually do a sports story well . so many in the past have been so hokey it was embarrassing to watch . not this one . it  s just a genuinely nice movie  an old  fashioned type of story  and based on a real  life guy to did exactly what dennis quaid did in this film . he plays a high school coach who is talked into trying out  late in life athletically  speaking  to become a pitcher in professional baseball . eventually  he reaches his goal of making it to the major leagues  even if it was a very brief stint .  br    br   all the characters in here are nice people  the kind you root for  from quaid to the players on his high school team  to his little boy  angus t . jones  now somewhat of a star on television .   br    br   quaid is believable in playing jim morris because  unlike actors in the past in sports films  he knows how to throw a baseball . he looks like a pitcher  a guy who could fire it    plus miles per hour . and  most of this film is true  as testified by the real  life pitcher in one the documentaries on the dvd .  br    br   so  if you  re looking for a nice  inspirational true life sports film  you can  t wrong with this one .  ,1
this is one of the worst movies i have seen this year . you should not see this movie but if you insist on wasting your time you should stop here  there are spoilers . gray matters centers on gray and sam baldwin  heather graham and tom cavanagh  . only gray and sam are brother and sister living together in everyone else  s eyes as man and wife . no sex but just about everything else . early on  the movie starts with its theme  the most absurd thing at the most absurd moment with you guessed it the most absurd reactions  . gray and sam decided to check out the dog park with a borrowed pooch . rather then push her brother to get the skinny on first woman they see for him  she does it and gets to the nitty  gritty questions too . when she signals her brother to come over they start a   way date . charlie  bridget moynahan  is the girl of their dreams  like all the right things etc sam final hits gray over the head and the couple finishes the date with a marriage proposal  that charlie accepts  in one week charlie  gray and sam are to be in vegas . in the next week charlie and gray are off shopping for wedding gowns  apparently charlie has an off  the  rack figure  . gray is slurping an iced latte when charlie suggests gray tries on some gowns as well and picks out a        frock for her . while charlie is zipping her in this  down  payment  on  a  house  gown gray continues to slurp on the latte  i swear it was like a feed bag  . what should happen but  woops   latte all over the gown . it is never explained how they got out of bloomingdale  s bridal salon with out a        mocha colored gown . back to  reality   caesar  s palace las vegas . they have the  high roller room   sam is a resident surgeon and charlie is an intern zoologist  were do they get all this money   gray kicks sam out to the single room down the hall so she and charlie can have a bachelorette drink  a  thon were  you guessed it  they kiss . gray remembers everything charlie remembers nada . they make it to wedding chapel and right when the reverend gets to his line  if there is anybody is here who has any objection whatsoever to the union of these two lovebirds  gray gets the hiccups . gray excuses herself  for some reason the reverend must repeat his last line and right on queue again  hiccups  . gray gets back to ny and starts dating any man she meets  literally . and of course one is you guessed it again  gay . the other is a jerk and the third is a taxi cab driver  alan cummings  named gordy . he is smittened with gray but the feelings are not returned . they become great friends . this is good because when she comes clean with sam about the kiss . he blows up and kicks her out of their apartment . when sam comes to his senses he goes to her office . gray works at an ad agency . this office is smack in the middle of the twilight zone . it has cameras and microphones in all the conference rooms that broadcast to all computer monitors at the agency . sam gets gray in one of the conference rooms for a not  so  private conversation and ends up outing her to the entire office . this is where i doubt that there was a gay man or lesbian on the crew gordy comes to her rescue and convinces her to go to a lesbian bar .  sorry no men  says the bouncer . so gray and gordy return with gordy in drag . bad drag . he was in a sleeveless black satin  like blouse  a string of pearls  and a grandma  s church hat . no lesbian would ever confuse this  man in a dress  as a drag queen much less a woman . the bar was also the straight man  s fantasy of what a lesbian bar is full of victoria  s secret models . everything turns out peachy  she goes home with her firm  s client . gray happens to be on the woman  s account and finally does more then kiss . for some reason no one tells charlie anything and she is oblivious through the whole movie of this kiss with gray  but that is for the sequel .  ,0
basically the exact same movie as  house of wax   vincent price  s first genuine horror hit released the previous year  but seriously who cares  because  the mad magician  offers just as many sheer thrills  delightful period set  pieces  joyous   d effects  sublime acting performances and macabre horror gimmicks as its predecessor   never change a winning team  is exactly what writer crane wilbur must have thought when he penned down price  s character don gallico  another tormented soul besieged by fate and out for vengeance against those who wronged him . don gallico is about to perform his very first own illusionist show as gallico the great and plans to exhibit the greatest magic trick in history entitled  the girl and the buzz saw  . gallico  s promising solo career is abruptly ruined before it even begins when his previous employer ross ormond appears on stage and shoves a contract under his nose  stating that all of gallico  s inventions are the rightful property of the company . the sleazy and relentless ormond  who by the way also ransacked gallico  s once beloved wife  takes off with the buzz saw trick and programs it in the show of gallico  s rival the great rinaldi . inevitably gallico snaps and sadistically butchers ormond  but  also being a master of creating disguises  recreates his victim  s image and even starts leading a double life .  the mad magician  is an amusing and thoroughly unpretentious    s horror movie in grand guignol style  with a whole lot of improbably plot twists  the landlady turns out a brilliant crime novelist   and a handful of fantastically grotesque gross  out moments  although they obviously remain suggestive for most part  . the   d delights near the beginning of the film  like a yo  yo player and a goofy trick with water fountains  merely just serve as time  filler and contemporary    s hype  but it  s still fun to watch even now and without the means to properly behold them .  the mad magician  is also interesting from a periodical setting point of view  as the events take place around the time fingerprints were starting to get used as evidence material and the character of alice prentiss is an obvious reference towards famous crime authors of that era . needless to state that vincent price remains the absolute most essential element of triumph in this film  as well as from nearly every other horror movie this legendary man ever starred in . like no other actor could ever accomplish  price depicts the tormented protagonist who gradually descends further and further into mental madness in such an indescribably mesmerizing way . you pity don gallico  yet at the same time you fear him enormously . you support his vile acts of retaliation and yet simultaneously you realize his murderous rampage must end in death . vincent price simply was a genius actor and  in my humble opinion  the embodiment of the horror genre .  ,1
this is a good movie  although people unfamiliar with the modesty blaise comics and books may find it a little slow and lacking in action . for the modesty fan  the movie will be very enjoyable  particularly because it is very faithful in its presentation of the modesty blaise  history  . peter o  donnell is listed in the credits as  creative consultant  and the film makers must have actually paid attention to him as the plot follows quite closely the details that have been presented in the comic books over the years although the events have been recast to modern days  . the only thing that the true fan may find disappointing is that there is no willie garvin in the story . this lack of willie is again just being faithful to the modesty blaise chronology since the movie takes place in the very early days of modesty  s career . alexandra staden makes a very believable young modesty who actually looks a lot like modesty is supposed to look . a welcome change from the travesty of the monica vitti portrayal of modesty .  ,1
i rented this one to see vanesa talor one more time . she can act  but doesn  t get a chance in this clunker . the opening sequence is an elaborate crane shot of mountain landscapes . must have come from a stock archive  because the movie is shot direct to videotape . the production values make  blair witch  look professional . there  s a really cheesy animated statue  but no other effects worth noting . this movie is bad  but not amusingly so . the players would do well not to mention it on their resumes .  ,0
it is a pity that you cannot vote zero stars on imdb  because i would not have hesitated  in fact i would go so far as to say that this film was in the negative stars .  br    br   i  like many others  bought this film thinking that because it has michael madsen in it  it could be good . . . no chance  this film was shocking  imagine a movie length  the bold and the beautiful   well  primal instinct did not even come close to that good  and i had previously thought that there would be nothing worse than a movie length  the bold and the beautiful  .  br    br   michael madsen  how could you do this to us  the worst part is  i didn  t fast forward a bit  i was hoping that at the end they would reveal that it was all some sort of sick joke  that they thought it would be funny to make us watch such a horribly bad film .  br    br   where do i start . . .  directing  zero stars  screenplay  zero stars  acting  zero stars  cinematography  zero stars  digital effects  zero stars  production design  zero stars  make  up  zero stars  casting  zero stars  editing  zero stars  trailer  half a star  graphic design  half a star  dvd menu  half a star .  br    br   however i think that it is very important to have seen bad films just so that you know what a really bad film is  so for that reason i am happy that i saw this film  just so that i have a bad film to put at the bottom of my list .  ,0
i just went to a screening of the film during expresion en corto  a short film festival in guanajuato  mexico . one of the producers was there and gave a brief introduction . the film rolled and from the first shot i was amazed one long continuous shot of a futuristic paris in glorious black and white .  br    br   i shouldn  t go on with the details  cause i think it is a film worth seeing . the sci  fi story might be found average for many . . . to me was really good . the action is great  the camera is free to fly everywhere and i mean everywhere . things you would not be able to do or see is accomplished beautifully . the cast performance is good  in my opinion no one hits the wrong note .  br    br   now  the thing that i found awesome is the animation .  d grafics look  d . a bw comic book brought to life . the details on the backgrounds gives more texture as if it had been done by hand  i  m sure it was but when the angles change you see the depth  .  br    br   the producer at the screening talked about the hard work behind the film  years  the director  she said  is brilliant  but perhaps he was quite unexperienced since he only had one short film in his cv . so  many people had true faith in them . they started their own studio from scratch and ever since they faced the challenge they brought upon them .  br    br   don  t miss it . i think you won  t regret it . . . maybe richard linklater for the final look of this film is superior to his i think .  ,1
sleepwalkers are creatures who drain the life force completely out of humans to survive . . . but they can only use virgins  it  s not explained why  . charles brady  brian krause  is one such who needs to feed his mother mary  alice krige  . he goes after likable tanya  madchen amick  . will she escape   br    br   on one hand this is a great horror film . fast  paced  plenty of blood and gore and a nice  twisted sense of humor . there are plenty of in joke references for horror buffs  castle rock is mentioned once  . also krause is excellent  who would have thought he could act after  return to the blue lagoon   as is kirge and amick . but i find this film annoying .  br    br   it was written for the screen by stephen king and it  s maddeningly vague . the sleepwalkers are never fully explained . where are they from  why are they called that  why does the son have to feed the mother  why do cats hate them and can kill them  what are their powers after all  at one point krause makes a car disappear and change color and style    why do they need to feed off peoples  life force  why does it have to be only virgins  why is the son having sex with his mom  none of these are explained leaving the story confusing . it  s really too bad because  those questions aside  this is an excellent horror film . excellent makeup and special effects too .  br    br   fast  gory and lots of fun . if only the script were better . also a fairly explicit sex scene between krause and krige was edited  you can tell  to get an r rating . i can only give this a  .  ,1
aaron spelling produced this made for television western that gets awfully plotty for a seventy three minute film . it plays like a probable failed series pilot .  br    br   handsome clint walker is u . s . marshal dave harmon  who wanders into yuma  arizona territory in time to kill one of the brothers of the local bigwig rancher who is out on a trail drive .  br    br   walker takes the other brother to jail . walker also meets a  cute  homeless mexican kid who sleeps at the jailhouse . one night  andres is snoozing when a villain and another man dressed in army blue take the remaining brother into the street and kill him  pinning the murder on walker . not good for your first twenty four hours on the job . walker visits the local army fort  and rankles the chains of the commander . the bigwig hears of his brothers  deaths  and rides back to town in time to get his chains rankled as well . the local native population  who get short changed by the army on their beef  also get rankled in the chains area . with all these chains getting rankled  walker still has time to woo the local hotel owner . the army guy involved in the murder ends up dead  the local cattle buyer is implicated  the indians do a lot of hesitant speechifying  and the climax brings about an unlikely showdown as walker must prove to the town that the villainous cattle buyer had a boss  someone we have suspected as being too helpful all along .  br    br   there is a semi  subplot involving the death of walker  s family at the hands of army raiders  and i think this would have been the force behind the series  had it been picked up . instead  the film ends abruptly  and i kept waiting for scenes from next week  s exciting episode . because of the fade outs for nonexistent commercial breaks  the pacing is all off on this and its story jumps in fits .  br    br   walker is handsome  rugged  and has a voice deeper than a well . the rest of the cast is full of television actors you have probably seen in other television movies . much of the action is pretty lame  and the violence is tepid . the first brother killed gets a shotgun blast midtorso  and falls without a scratch on him . i did not expect  reservoir dogs   but this is the wrong film to use to teach children about the evil of guns  speaking of children  the mexican kid here goes from  cute  to  aneurysm inducing annoyance  very quickly .  br    br   if you dislike westerns  then you will dislike  yuma .  if you like westerns  then you will still dislike  yuma .  i cannot recommend it .  br    br   this is unrated  but contains physical violence and gun violence .  br    br    ,0
characters you don  t care about  relationships you don  t care about and you sit through all that to see the ending you knew was coming from the start . julia roberts usually leaves no impression on me one way or the other . she was actually somewhat endearing in this role .  ,0
great movie when i saw it . have to say one of my favorite movies of all time . i saw it like  times in the theater and got the dvd . as i got older and saw it again i realized that the movie is average . compared to movies that are known ad good comedys  this is nothing . i mean rock was hilarious in the movie and the whole switching with the racial stuff breaks a little barriers which is great . also the thought of how the movie goes is a nice way of thinking . it  s like most thought of a movie but also a little twist which is a very nice touch . i like the movie overall so i give it a . . .  br    br   still a good     for me .  ,1

the effect achieved in this story about a psychiatrist who becomes involved with con artists is so mannered that i have to assume that that was the desired intent . the sets are artificial and at no time did i not feel that i was watching a movie . it seemed like the actors were just reading their lines  rather than responding to one another . while the film has elements of early film noir  except that it is in color  the approach is so exaggerated that i almost have to conclude that it is a parody of the genre .  br    br   given that the presentation had no appeal to me  i was at least expecting an engaging story . usually i am pretty slow on the uptake when it comes to stories with plot twists  but you could see what was coming here within the first fifteen minutes . by the time of the   gee  i forgot the          moment  i thought to myself that this thing is truly ridiculous . for a psychiatrist with stated experience in gambling addictions to behave so stupidly is beyond belief . if at any stage she had behaved like a normal intelligent person  the whole story would have fallen apart .  br    br   this wooden production left me cold .  ,0
some years ago  satellite channel u . k . gold promoted repeats of  men behaving badly  with the hype  here it is  the original flat  sharing sitcom   . this was in fact untrue .  man about the house  was also a flat  sharing sitcom and ran from        .  br    br   it was the brainchild of johnnie mortimer and brian cooke  creators of the popular sitcom  father dear father  . when it ended  they decided they wanted to do something more in harmony with the times .  br    br   in the first episode  chrissy  paula wilcox  and jo  sally thomsett  are tidying their myddleton terrace flat following a wild party when they find a man in their bath . he is robin tripp  richard o  sullivan   a southampton cookery student of no fixed abode . while his clothes dry out  he puts on a ladies  dressing gown and prepares them a meal . they are so impressed by his culinary skills that they invite him to stay . but there must be no naughty business . so robin has to pretend to be gay . . .  br    br   on b . b . c .    s  i love       shown in      julie burchill claimed that  house  showed her a way of life she envied . she was not alone . one of the most iconic  for me  anyway  images of     s british television was sally thomsett coming out of the london underground carrying a parasol  and a  blind  man doing a double take as her pert bottom swings past .  br    br   a man living with two girls was a risqu subject for the time  but mrs . mary whitehouse had no need to get hot under the collar  it was innocent  good  natured fun . mortimer and cooke  s scripts went as close as they could to the edge without crossing it .  br    br   richard o  sullivan was still playing  bingham  in i . t . v .  s  doctor in charge  when this got started . in fact the second run of  in charge  overlapped with the first of  house  . he was born to play the sex  mad robin . paula wilcox  s  chrissy  was more streetwise than  beryl   her character she played in  the lovers   while sally thomsett  s  jo  was a lovable dizzy blonde . as time wore on  he became almost like an older brother to them .  br    br   for many viewers  brian murphy and yootha joyce stole the show as the warring ropers . george had lost interest in sex  but mildred had not . they went on to their own show  the aptly titled  george  mildred  . the late doug fisher was good value as as robin  s wideboy friend larry . he worked so well he was made into a regular .  br    br   within a year of its debut  there was the inevitable movie spin  off . i am not a big fan of the  man about the house  movie because i think it was stretched to fit the big screen . most of its characters had never appeared in the series .  br    br   the format was sold to america  where it became the long  running  three  s company  starring the late john ritter and suzanne somers . it was far more suggestive than the british original  with somers often seen in sexy clothing .  br    br   after six seasons   house  ended with chrissy marrying robin  s older brother norman  norman eshley  . fans were devastated to see robin failing to get the girl he loved  but there was some consolation in the fact that he too landed his own show   robin  s nest  .  ,1
what a fascinating film . even if it wasn  t based on real life  forbidden lies was a fascinating portrait of a con artist in her element . and it is the kind of film psychology students could study to learn about compulsive liars .  br    br   the author of forbidden love  norma  was revealed as a fraud in the media but this move really does give her ample opportunity to clear her name .  br    br   but the twists and turns she takes the documentary maker through are amazing . what a patient woman  i loved this movie . i have not read the book but simply heard good reviews and went to see it on boring rainy afternoon . the journey this film takes you on is clever  interesting and totally engrossing .  ,1
gary busey is the title character  frank  bulletproof  mcbain  your standard  issue reckless maverick cop who  s earned his nickname because no matter how many bullets he takes    and counting   he never stops going after the bad guys .  br    br   when a cutting  edge u . s . tank dubbed  thunderblast  is driven across the border into mexico  it  s nabbed by revolutionaries  terrorists led by general brogado  rene enriquez  and libyan colonel kartiff  henry silva   who  s aligned himself with russian villains . the army personnel involved are kept as prisoners  chief among them devon shepard  darlanne fluegel   who happens to be mcbain  s ex  girlfriend . mcbain is then recruited by the army for a rescue mission .  br    br   busey may not have the physical presence of say  someone like schwarzenegger  who would have been another appropriate lead for a film of this type  but he  s a blast as a self  confident dude who  s quick with the wisecracks . fluegel is a great female lead she not only looks incredibly sexy but makes for a fine butt  kicking action babe . enriquez  silva  juan fernandez  and the always welcome william smith  as a russian major  are loathsome scum in the classic action movie tradition . the supporting cast is quite full of familiar and reliable character actors l . q . jones  r . g . armstrong  thalmus rasulala  lincoln kilpatrick  mills watson  luke askew  danny trejo  and cary  hiroyuki tagawa .  br    br   t . l . lankford and b . j . goldman supply the script  based on a story by lankford and veteran b director fred olen ray . it  s the kind of script where you just know the writers have their tongues in their cheeks they know their material is absurd and cheesy  and just have fun throwing credibility out the window . veteran action director steve carver keeps it moving and delivers a respectable amount of gunfire  explosions  and general all  out mayhem .  br    br    bulletproof  is good fun for the action fan who doesn  t mind switching off their brain now and then and just enjoying a generous assortment of violence and humor .  br    br        ,1
the cowboys could leave you a little sore in the saddle . definitely not one of johns best movies . don  t get me wrong  with any john wayne move there is always some good spots . and this one has it  s fair share . but over all the picture moves slow and just doesn  t live up to the aspirations it could have been . bruce dern again does an outstanding job as the villain . roscoe lee brown is another bright spot in the movie . the kids in the movie were average but could have been cast better . this would be a good movie for the eight to fifteen year old movie goers .  br    br   this would be a good family move to watch with your children . just be aware  there is a couple of scenes that you may want to take a look at before you let the young ones see it . but most kids that i know who have seen the movie like it . maybe it  s because they get to see kids their age do all the grown up work .  ,0
i generally don  t give worry much about violence in films  or a vast amount of philosophy  symbolism or psychology . all this is very well with me and the film brings a lot of the above to us . there is beautiful pictures especially of the lake and the nature  a good setting of characters  a good direction . this film could be voted for as a good film . however  it is spoiled for two reasons and both of these reasons in relation make this film simply disgusting .  br    br   first of all there is violence used against living creatures to make this film . not movie violence  i am talking about real violence . this violence alone maybe could be justified if not and thats reason number two the message of the film was not mere introspection about the directors twisted relation towards women . not that we all don  t have some real twists with women .  respectively men  . but the conclusion of the film ruins it all .  br    br   spoiler our  heroine  finally dies   by here own hand if i remember correctly i saw this film years ago and it enraged me  now the guy is out with a new film witch i am certainly not going to watch  and is now even more clearly depicted as some kind of natural demon  nature growing over her  in particular her sex . . of course it is the director who  kills  the women heroine . women have to die  especially if men are attracted by their sexuality . that seems to be the final conclusion . end spoiler  br    br   well  well all that possibly would be fine with me if the director would have kept his view to himself . but to use big pictures  artsy directions cruelty to living creatures  just to say men can be frightened of women  and men are cruel to women . thats just not enough . i knew when i saw this film it would achieve good critics for the  philosophical  eastern and artistic  and whatever approach . but to me this film is just totally marred .  ,0
i  ll admit i  ve only watched a handful of episodes  but each one seemed completely different from the next . it seems after the first season  the producers decided to completely retool the show  drop characters  introduce new ones  and rewrite the entire show dynamic .  br    br   as you have probably surmised already  the show is about quirky  unpredictable teenager holly  amanda bynes  who moves in with her high strung sister valerie  jennie garth  in new york city . decent enough premise odd couple  fish out of water  high jinx .  br    br   while i miss the sitcoms of yore  this show unfortunately misses the mark on funny repeatedly  and it  s sad because they have some decent talent .  br    br   on top of everything  they insisted on changing the show  val was living with a cast regular bf one season  then he was suddenly gone  so she opens a bakery  what   when things change that drastically  you get the feeling that even the show knows it  s bad . i mean  completely new sets  characters written off and new show regulars   br    br   on a side note  this is just nitpicking   i know this is a television show and not real at all  but val and holly end up living in a huge loft duplex  there are stairs  with a terrace . . . in manhattan  are you serious    ,0
i read a few reviews of this tv movie which all said that the film dragged on for too long and that it was basically only sensationalistic entertainment . i agree that perhaps  the film goes on a bit too long   h   would have been enough . . .  but i certainly do not think it sensationalize the subject matter . jim jones  expansive power trip and slow degradation into mental illness  paranoia and drug abuse are never treated in a voyeuristic manner . the movie takes its time in showing how jones recruited followers  brenda vaccaro  s and brad dourif  s character are stand  outs in that matter  but also in observing an uncanny shift in jones  perception of reality . it is mind  boggling to see an egalitarian  left  wing and compassionnate preacher become such a destructive and cruel dictator . perhaps the movie doesn  t explore jones  motivations enough  which can make the whole ordeal a bit superficial at times  may have to do with censorship as well . . .  but powers boothe  s mesmerizing performance makes it all come true . i am not familiar with the details of the real jim jones  life  but boothe sure makes the monster he plays believable and real . the movie features many strong scenes  among them the preaching messes of jones  jones  s meeting with father divine  a remarquable james earl jones   congressman leo ryan  ned beatty   s visit to the guyana camp and of course  the suicide scene . it is quite a gloomy spectable to watch and boothe is quite commanding in those last moments . madge sinclair shines in this scene as one of the suddenly sceptic follower  and so do veronica cartwright  as jones  wife  and brad dourif  especially when their time comes to drink the murderous potion . the relative calm of the end of this scene  the tasteful direction and the contrasting beauty of the natural surroundings all work in making those images quite impossible to erase from one  s mind . a disturbing reflection on human nature and its weaknesses . worth watching  if only to keep in mind one of the truly horrific events of the   th century . not to let it be repeated again . like  ironically  the inscription in jim jones  camp  those who do not know the past are bound to repeat it  .  ,1
remember ralph bakshi  the guy that was an animator on terrytoons  then on paramount cartoon studios  after that  he was a director on fritz the cat    and heavy traffic  well  this is coonskin . and it  s actually pretty good . racist  but good . the movie takes place in harlem nights  no  duh  it was a working title .  but with a twist that becomes a lampoon of a disney movie  song of the south .  br    br   it  s about sampson  barry white  and the preacherman  charles gordone  rush to help their friend  randy  philip michael thomas  escape from prison  but are stopped by a roadblock and wind up in a shootout with the police . while waiting for them  randy unwillingly listens to fellow escapee pappy  scatman crothers   as he begins to tell randy a story about  three guys  i used to know  just like you and your friends  . pappy  s story is told in animation set against live  action background photos and footage .  br    br   brother rabbit  voice of thomas   brother bear  voice of white   and preacher fox  voice of gordone  decide to pack up and leave their southern settings after the bank mortgages their home and sells it to a man who turns it into a brothel . arriving in harlem  rabbit  bear  and fox find that it isn  t all that it  s made out to be . they encounter a con man named simple savior  a phony revolutionary leader who purports to be the  cousin  of black jesus  and that he gives his followers  the strength to kill whites  . in a flashy stage performance in his  church   savior acts out being brutalized by symbols of black oppressionrepresented by images of john wayne  elvis presley and richard nixon  before asking his parishioners for  donations  .  br    br   rabbit first goes up against madigan  a virulently racist and homophobic white police officer and the bag man for the mafia  who demonstrates his contempt for african americans in various ways  including a refusal to bathe before an anticipated encounter with them  he believes they  re not worth it  . when madigan finds out that rabbit has been taking his payoffs  he and his cohorts  ruby and bobby  are led to a nightclub called  the cottontail  .  br    br   a black stripper distracts him while an lsd sugar cube is dropped into his drink . madigan  while under the influence of his spiked drink  is then maneuvered into a sexual liaison with a stereotypically effeminate gay man  and then shoved into clothes that women were representative of the racist archetype  adorned in something racist  and finally shoved out the back of the club where he discovers that ruby and bobby are dead .  br    br   then  while recovering from his delirium of being drugged  shoots his gun around randomly  and is shot to death by the police after shooting one of them .  br    br   rabbit  bear  fox and the opponent boxer rush out of the boxing arena as it blows up . the live  action story ends with randy and pappy escaping while being shot at by various white cops  but managing to make it out alive .  br    br   this movie was controversial at that time of release  and was re  edited by the director several times under the title  street fight  which is obvious  since street fight is a     documentary about racism in the streets . in fact  this movie has the same subject as the documentary .  br    br   that caused bryanston pictures  the distributor of this film and the original tobe hopper classic  texas chainsaw massacre  to go out of business . because paramount wanted to produce and distribute this film  but due to racism  bryanston took over bakshi  s production .  br    br   despite the controversy  it was worth the entertainment . the animation was awesome at that time  the plot makes sense  and it  s actually funny too .  br    br   final verdict      ,1
this is a great film for mccartney  s and beatles fans  a splendid time is guaranteed for all . the audience  feat some celebrities such as nicholson  cuzak  michael douglas  is  as always  quite amazingfrom small children to old campaigners of the sixties . they know the words to all the songs by heart  and some of them are crying when paul breaks into  blackbird   yesterday   all my loving  and all the treasures of his catalog  who  except john lennon and dylan  can claim such a repertoire   . there are two particularly moving moments  br    br    the double tribute to lennon and harrisonfirst  here today  performed solo  the title was included in  tug of war      and was its best track   then  something  when paul uses an ukulele .  br    br     the long and winding road  rendition  a key moment  when paul  s voice cracks  as he is moved to tears by the hearts the members of the tour crew hold in front of the stage .  br    br   i remember  in the early seventies  when people used to despise paul  cause he was not involved in politics  as his ex  partner was . they had to change their mind for paul is a committed artist  fame is great cause it allows charity  . the film shows different aspects of paul  s activities  an artist who is anything but selfish .  ,1
hak hap  black mask  is what i  d like to call a ballet with fists and explosions . sure the plot has been tried and heard before   a biologically engineered soldier that is part of a elite fighting force of supermen that decides he feels that killing and brute force aren  t the ways to settle every thing and becomes a pacifist  and a librarian . but when he learns that the rest of his group is trying to get an antidote that will keep them alive by taking on the police  his best friend is a cop  he becomes the black mask .  the style that the movie goes for  very visual  works and at least for me is entertaining . i love martial arts movies that are a spectical . people flying around lighter than air and recovering a split second after impact keeps the pace and action non stop . but that is what this movie is about anyway right  a showcase of jet li doing what he does best  and that is spectacular showmanship of his skills  which to say the least are top notch . as with most of the fast action martial arts movies ala . jackie chan and sammo hung that are just now showing themselves here in the states for the first time  these movies are low on plot and high on amazing physical feats . but i must say  even with the large holes left in the plot  like how do we see him safe in his apartment when just one scene before he had   men that are no more than   feet from him with sign of escape  who knows the scene just cuts to him in the apartment . . . . . . . ohh well suspension of belief i guess   the movie to me stays interesting . it is only until the last   minutes that the film seems to feel like it could have been a little shorter . but still all around a great high paced action movie .  ,1
luise rainer received an oscar for her performance in the good earth . unfortunately  her role required no . she did not say much and looked pale throughout the film . luise  s character was a slave then given away to marriage to paul muni  s character  he did a fantastic job for his performance  . set in ancient asia  both actors were not asian  but were very convincing in their roles . i hope that paul muni received an oscar for his performance  because that is what luise must have gotten her oscar for . she must have been a breakthrough actress  one of the first to method act . this seems like something that hollywood does often . al pacino has played an italian and cuban . i felt luise  s performance to be lackluster throughout  and when she died  she did not change in expression from any previous scenes . she stayed the same throughout the film she only changed her expression or emotion maybe twice . if her brilliant acting was so subtle  i suppose i did not see it .  ,0
given its time of release  the story that unravels in     thriller  panic in the streets  was hardly a surprise . the corpse of a mysterious illegal immigrant is found and passed off as a nobody until further examination from a public health inspector who claims the corpse carries a strain of bubonic plague . yet with the current drama in the world today  this strangely helps this film in appearing credible for today  s viewers . the cast and crew are flawless . richard widmark in his first role following his breakthrough performance in  night and the city   jack palance in his chilling film debut  also starring in this film are paul douglas and a young  and rather cute  barbara bel geddes . a whole slew of uncredited  non  professional actors  typical of director kazan  fill in the remaining slots . elia kazan directs  joe macdonald films  he would later work with richard widmark again in      s much superior  pickup on south street   and the great alfred newman scores it . nearly everyone involved here has done better work   panic in the streets  is quite the rewarding watch  nonetheless . especially for the film  noir enthusiast .  ,1
i became more emotionally attached to this movie than any other i have ever watched . that may be because i can see the characters as my own grandparents  attempting to make sense of a world at war . the ending and use of pachabel  s cannon are both amazing .  ,1
i enjoyed this movie quite a lot . i have always been a fan of whoopi goldberg and this movie only emphasizes it . she portrays a housewife in an african  american family which is moving up the social chain due to the husband  s  danny glover  success as an attorney . she moves to an all white neighborhood where the people are friendly  yet a little awkward toward her . the various events that arise during the course of the movie make for some laughs but mostly appeal to the other emotions . this movie is not so much a comedy as a drama . i give it a strong     . i highly recommend you catch it on tv or rent it soon .  ,1
the direction had clearly stated that this film  s idea and plot is totally original . . . . however  as to those who have read  slam dunk  comic  we can clearly see that the characters are very similar and even some jokes . . .  br    br   another note is jay chow himself do not know kung fu  it just won  t impress anyone if he tries to act like he can  many people today can see the differences . . luckily the movie do not contain much of kung fu fighting and much are enchanced by stunners and visual effects . . .  br    br   i think that jay  s acting is still a pain to watch  especially when almost everyone else in the film is so much better . the only reason i think why jay is the main actor is simply is for his popularity .  br    br   despite how hard i wish to stop anyone from watching this thus making this  orginal  movie getting what it shouldn  t have  it has became one of the best budget films in china for this year .  ,0
the plot for descent  if it actually can be called a plot  has two noteworthy events . one near the beginning  one at the end . together these events make up maybe   of the total movie time . everything  and i mean  everything   in between is basically the director  s desperate effort to fill in the minutes . i like disturbing movies  i like dark movies and i don  t get troubled by gritty scenes  but if you expect me to sit through   minutes of hazy  dark  literally  scenes with no storyline you have another thing coming . rosario dawson  one of my favorite actresses is completely wasted here . and no  she doesn  t get naked  not even in the nc    version  which i saw .  br    br   if you have a couple of hours to throw away and want to watch  descent   take a nap instead  you  ll probably have more interesting dreams .  ,0
okay . . this wasn  t the worst movie i  ve ever seen  but i had heard lots of good things about it and i was sorely disappointed . i could see where the film makers were coming from and that they were trying to express the fact that the two sides in this battle weren  t a whole lot different from one another  that the individuals were getting lost in the fighting  etc  etc .  well  that  s my presumption  anyway      br    br   at any rate . . the movie kind of bored me . i  ve watched a lot of really long movies  but this one just seemed to drag on and on and on . . basically because i just couldn  t bring myself to care for any of the characters . i just kept thinking . . who cares    i also found the acting to be rather dead pan and the dialogue strained . i understand that this was the     s and all  but most of the conversations just seemed rather unnatural . no one seemed to have any emotion throughout most of the film except during melodramatic events .  br    br   the  romance  in the story didn  t seem to be supported by anything other than  i  m a guy and you  re a girl   which i don  t consider much of a romance  and yet i felt i was being steered to the belief that these people were in love . oh well . . i guess it  s the whole  all this horror around us  we have each other to cling to  type thing  or whatever . i was also hoping for some sort of dynamic between the two best friends  who both initially seemed to have an interest in the girl  but that was just sort of dropped . maybe avoiding a cliche love triangle . i don  t know .  br    br   oh well . . daniel holt was about the only character i really truly liked . and sue lee was all right . i didn  t exactly dislike jake  but he seemed a bit too . . . spineless  i guess . jack bull i did not care for at all . and i  m pretty sure you  re supposed to hate just about everyone else  with the exception of the poor normal people who just get mowed down left and right . it was pretty graphic and had that whole  the horrors of war  thing down  but i  ve seen plenty of other movies with the same theme  done better .  i enjoyed the patriot a lot  for instance  even if it was a bit emotionally manipulative  but  as i  ve already stated  i  m a cynic . what can i say     ,0
metro  goldwyn  mayer is a very lost player in the short cartoon market . this market is essentially dominated by the looney tunes and the merry melodies shorts  coming from warner bros . but mgm is also able of releasing hidden gems  like  to spring   an astonishing story about the most beautiful season of the year .  br    br   in the environment depicted here  spring isn  t caused by natural cycles  but is fabricated . and by who  by little male elves who live below ground . each spring  when the snow begins to melt  they start working . they begin by felling rainbow rock columns  then reducing them to rubble and using this rubble to turn it into color fluids  which will be moved up to the ground and bearing grass  flowers . . . in other words  spring  the first half of the cartoon depicts spring  s fabrication  but the second part is a little bit different . old man winter comes back and he tries to extend winter by destroying the elves  work . so from this point  we assist to a battle between the elves and old man winter .  br    br   the music heard here is deliciously wonderful . the melodic parts stick in the head like an ink spot on a paper sheet . the second part melodies are thrilling and they perfectly fit with the action . this is just fantastico  giorgio  the animation sequences are also a delight . the colors are well mixed and every little detail is shown into a massive  epic environment . the concept itself is brilliant . the elves are attracting characters  so is old man winter  who effectively portrays the cold and ruthless feelings of the white season .  br    br   there  s also a strong message included here . the battle seems lost for the elves at the end  until a single late arriving elf jump into the action and it leads to the elves  victory over winter . so the point is only one single person can make the difference .  br    br   in conclusion   to spring  is a remarkable lost classic from short cartoon era . what is even more remarkable is that this cartoon  s director made his debut here . and who is  to spring   s director  it  s a certain william hanna . . .  ,1

i haven  t seen anything this bad since i walked out of the james bond movie  moonraker  twenty years ago . i managed to sit through the entirety of this one only because of tilda swinton  but there was nothing she could do to save this beast .  br    br   as a cross between  pi    orlando   and  tron   this movie failed miserably in every aspect of moviemaking . the characters were cardboard and unable to evoke any kind of sympathy . the plot was wholly unbelievable . the acting was  with the exception of swinton  amateur . the computer graphics were worse than in  tron .  timothy leary was extremely annoying . i could go on  but what  s the point .  br    br   the only good thing i can say about this film is that tilda swinton was in it . i have no idea why an actress of her caliber consented to appear in such a dud  but she most likely regrets it now .  br    br   don  t waste your money or your time on this stinker . there  s nothing worth seeing here .  ,0
this movie is like real life  by which i mean  not a lot happens in the available  hours or so  and not much game plan or plot is evidenced by the frequently invisible cast  their invisibility being due to the  experimental  lighting as mentioned by many reviewers  .  br    br   a big bore . no big surprise that altman helms this  he is a very variable performer  yes we all loved  gosford park   but  pret a porter  anyone  kansas city  dr t . and the women  aaargh   but the fact that the raw material is a john grisham tale  and the excellent cast that you will perceive through the gathering gloaming of your insistent slumber  makes this truly a masterpiece of bad film . and no  it is not  so bad it  s good  .  br    br   it  s just bad .  ,0
this movie just pulls you so deeply into the two main characters . i popped it into my laptop without even reading the cover  let alone reviews  and was intrigued for two solid hours . two lost ships from two different worlds collide . the sexual tension that brews between a secretary and a criminal is almost palpable even without hardly any physical contact . toward the end i couldn  t decide which i wanted more our hero and heroine to pull off their caper or simply consummate their passion . rml could  ve done without a curious subplot and a traditional    minutes would have been plenty . i  m nitpicking though . after a series of netflix  blockbuster and local library duds this movie restored my faith in great film making .  ,1
jane eyre  is one of the greatest novels in the english language and this screenwriter should of read it . i hate it when writers use spark notes for what a novel is all about . this movie is unbearable to watch if you have read the book .  br    br   the whole  red room  is so down played that i wonder why they even bother to put it in . in the book the  red room  is foreshadowing for the whole story and the rest of jane  s life . helen burns is treated so badly in the movie i  m sure she was happy to die and leave early . in the book she is one of the most compelling characters and she was not the red head . the whole christian theme is missing from her life and the rest of the movie .  br    br   do yourself a favor and miss this movie and read the story as charlotte bronte masterfully told it .  ,0

the legendary boris karloff ended his illustrious career by making four cheapie fright flick clunkers in mexico . this is the token moody period gothic horror entry from the bunch . karloff gives a typically spry and dignified performance as matthias morteval  an elderly eccentric patriarch who invites several of his petty  greedy and backbiting no  count relatives to his creepy rundown castle for the reading of a will . pretty soon the hateful guests are getting bumped off by lethal life  sized toy people who populate the place . onetime mexican sex symbol andres garcia of  tintorera  infamy portrays the dashing police officer hero and julissa looks absolutely ravishing as the sole likable female character . the clunky  plodding  non  direction  trite by  the  numbers script  ugly  washed  out cinematography  ridiculous murder set pieces  a gross fat slob gets blasted right in the face by a miniature cannon    overwrought string score  morbid gloom  doom atmosphere  largely lousy acting  karloff notably excepted   cheesy mild gore  poor dubbing and rousing fiery conclusion all lend this enjoyably awful lemon a certain endearingly cruddy and hence oddly amusing ratty charm . a real campy hoot .  ,1
my one line summary should explain it all  but i  ll have a go at it .  br    br   from the get  go  this movie seemed like an overdone soap opera  and that  s about all i can comment on . there were a few interesting scenes  such as the  big one  that hit during the middle of the movie  but  wait  what  s that  the earthquake gasp  wait a minute  that  s dante  s peak  well  parts of it butchered and slapped in . i can  t believe how poorly this movie was done   borrowing  scenes from other  much better films . one wonders what director thought that viewers are dumb enough to believe large wooded mountain  esque backdrops exist in downtown la  ala dante  s peak .  br    br   my advise  forget the bond wanna  be  nash  in this film and go for the real thing  again  someone from dante  s peak coincidentally .   br    br    ,0
as with all of angelopoulos  films   the suspended step of the stork  implicitly demands a close and intimate participation on the part of the viewer  a fact that has certainly contributed to the limited popularity of his work . dialogues are sparing  with no monologues or exchanges exteriorizing the characters  inner conflicts  doubts  or feelings . the filmmaker prefers to keep the viewers away from their own emotional responses  and instead forces them to explore and study the characters  identities for themselves . as a result  the acting is understated and implicit  as opposed to overt and explicit .  br    br   the action scenes are set between long intervals of contemplation  where the viewer is asked to become a participant  to participate as an actor  by probing his or her own psyche . as in a novel  where the drama rests entirely on the author  s writing to provide a template where the reader  s imagination and  or past experience flourish  angelopoulos  drama rests within his images his uses of the long shots  the long takes  the leisurely pacing  the sparing dialogues that have become his trademark  inviting the viewer to experience the film from his or her personal perspective . angelopoulos uses silence to capture moments of high intensity  reverting to the non  verbal language of gestures  gazes  sounds  and music  when he believes that words can only take us so far .  br    br   the music  by angelopoulos  long time collaborator  eleni karaindrou  provides more than just a discreet background  but becomes itself a dramatic element of the story . a large part of the film consists of exterior shots in subtle  subdued colors  recorded in a drab winter light . angelopoulos presents us with an  other greece   one far different from the greece of the tourist brochures  with ethereal blue skies and emerald seas  drowned in an eternal sunshine . here  the skies are covered and gray  the air is cold and misty  and the sands of the pristine beaches have been replaced by the trampled  dirty snow of the village streets . angelopoulos  genius through arvanitis  camera is on display throughout the film .  br    br    the suspended step of the stork  is above all else a political statement aimed at the socio  political situation in the balkans at the end of the twentieth century . it is deeply concerned with the meaning of  borders   and with those who are the victims of the confusion between nations . in the  waiting room  facing the albanian border  the refugees  political or other  outcast by the rest of humanity  wait . they may be stuck against a political border  but unfortunately they still carry with them  and hang on  deeper ancestral borders those of the languages  of the customs  and of the races . although angelopoulos  political views are well known  the film steers clear of any political discourse regarding the causes of the refugees  plights . in the process  angelopoulos forces us to meditate on the concepts of geographical  cultural  political  and personal  borders .   br    br   angelopoulos considers himself a historian of twentieth century greece  and he likes to bring lessons from the hellenic myths into his discussions . in this film  he does some border crossing himself between the greek and italian cultures  drawing from a combined homeric and dantesque tradition of odysseus  travel . alexander is a telemachus  in search of a story about an aging greek politician  odysseus who disappeared  never to be heard of again . this political man  a brilliant orator  unexpectedly and inexplicably left the comfort of his bourgeois existence  his wife  and his brilliant career  to live anonymously in a refugee camp with the lowest of the low . he became a poet in exile wondering how to change the world . of course  the  politician  is not alexander  s father  but the  politician  stands before alexander like a father figure  odysseus . as with homer  s telemachus  alexander grows as a person during his odyssey .  br    br   of course  it would be wrong to try and see in the film a retelling of homer  s odyssey in a contemporary context . angelopoulos draws on odysseus  s travels only as structuring and thematic elements for his film . in angelopoulos  ending   odysseus  is more like the dante  s odysseus he does not leave for ithaca but goes on   carrying a suitcase .  and alexander  telemachus is  suspended  between returning to his home and his career  or embarking on a voyage to  somewhere else .  he states as much  in a voice  over at the beginning of the film  paraphrasing few lines from dante  s  inferno    and don  t forget that the time for a voyage has come again . the wind blows your eyes far away .   br    br   finally  although angelopoulos is not a religious person  there is a greek orthodox religious theme introduced during the film in the form of the yellow  suited linesmen  who go around bettering things for their fellow human beings by reconnecting communications  and also the christ  like figure of the  politician .  in the final scene  these men in yellow demonstrate once more the byzantine iconography  s influence in angelopoulos  work . they appear like  stylites   religious figures found in the orthodox tradition  solitary and fervent men who took up their abode upon the tops of pillars  in a form of asceticism .  br    br   the film ends without a resolution as to the true identity of the character played by mastroianni . angelopoulos does not give us any clues  and the wife  s statement   it  s not him   is far from convincing and left ambiguous enough . the important question of the film is not whether he is or is not the vanished politician  but that he could be the politician . but the film still ends on an optimistic note . whereas the wires strung from pole to pole run only along the river  and thus communications across the border are still not possible  and it remains impenetrable  we note that this final scene is taken from a point of view across the river the camera has crossed the border  and the reverse tracking shot is inviting alexander and the viewer to follow beyond the boundary . on this account  angelopoulos gives us hope that somehow  some of the borders will eventually crumble .  ,1
terrible acting  lame plot  stupid story and just all around terrible movie sums up this piece of junk . it was excruciating to sit through . just awful . do not waste one penny on this . the movie theaters should feel bad about actually putting this movie out there for people to watch . this  horror  film was not even in the least bit scary  creepy or disturbing . it was in no way visually appealing . the acting was so terrible by all of the actors that any attempt to draw you into the movie through dialog are completely destroyed within moments of the actor  actress opening their mouth . plus the entire story  i don  t know why someone would make a movie with this story again . do not waste your time or money . even if it  s a free ticket don  t waste one moment viewing this movie . you will feel dumber for watching it .  ,0
sarafina was a fun movie  and some of the songs were really great . sarafina was very entertaining . i don  t normally like music things like this  but the singing was not lame like it looked like on the box . the movie was useful for learning about history because it was an interesting perspective of the soweto rioting of     . it showed you things from the perspective of the students in the rioting and showed you that they were real characters . because you got to see them as real characters this makes you like them more as an audience  and makes you more sympathetic to them as totally the victims of the white government  who you can not sympathise with . the singing of the students is correct because we know from accounts that the students in the riot were singing and dancing before it became violent . the clothing of the students in sarafina is very similar to the clothing shown in photos from soweto . they made the movie actually in soweto  which is why it looks very accurate in many parts . all these things make the film more accurate for someone using it to learn about aparthied . as viewers we must be critical of the way the history of apartheid was presented . as i said before  you become sympathetic to the students  this makes it potentially less reliable and objective . also  it changes some of the details from other accounts . in sarafina it turns to chaos when the policeman comes into their classroom and shoots the students . the police and army were very aggressive at soweto  but this is probably an exaggerated event . the police and army did shoot students  but there is not evidence of them going into schools and executing people like this . the fighting was more in the streets and had looting and crime . this is done in the movie probably to make you feel more sorry for the school students . the movie would have been more useful if it had some different information about aparthied . the teacher was arrested for being against the government  and the mum goes to work in a white persons house . but there is not any information about the government and why they were doing it or any details about the racist policies and laws .  by george s  chris and finlay  ,1
those individuals familiar with asian cinema  as a whole  are aware that japan is renowned  or notorious  for it  s hyper  violent films and korea is now garnering a reputation for viciously brutal films . dog bites dog  while not necessarily getting as hyper  violent as the craziest miike film  nor is it as unapologetically brutal as some koreas more ambitious efforts  it is a perfect in between with its own brand of brutality all it  s own . the greatest strength this film has though  like the greatest of the japanese or korean efforts  is that the brutality  rather than detracting from the film  actually develops the characters  if not  pushing the story forward . the two main characters are both incredibly vicious individuals with their own motivations and emotional underpinning for being as such . sam lee  s character  for instance  is on the edge from the very start and slowly and surely  amidst various encounters with chang  s character  it is revealed why he is . without spoiling this part of the story too much  it involves the morally ambiguous nature of his father . chang  s character  on the other hand  has his most primal instincts honed to  if not perfection  brutal efficiency . surprisingly  chang  s story arch  while not necessarily revealing a more human side  actually reveals a side to our animal nature which many forget about which is the natural ability to recognize a fellow broken animal  and no i am not talking about sam lee  rather pei pei  s garbage dump girl character  . ultimately however  for the first   minutes or so  it is a  more or less  straight forward cat and mouse  or dog chase dog  film in which every encounter ends in at least one death  seriously  once sam lee and chang square off  some one will die  and the fun part of movie is you never know who hands will commit the act . which brings us to the film  s one weakness . unforunatley to delve into it would be yet another spoiler but  to put it simply  it is guilty of pushing one of the main points of the film since  rather then letting the point be made as is   minutes into the film  the film goes on for another   minutes or so to further emphasize it . don  t get me wrong  if transitioned better from the   minute mark to the climax and if the final act wasn  t filled with sweet music  in fact if it  like the majority of the film  kept the music to the barest minimum and let the disturbing sound effects do their job   it still could have worked and not detract from the film . as it is though  despite the third act having the most vicious and bloody of the encounters  the way it was handled made it feel tacked on  and almost  insults the viewers intelligence since it felt it had to go this far to get it across . nevertheless  it is still a breath of fresh air from hong kong cinema since even the most bloody of the martial arts films never reaches the level of viciousness and brutality while keeping the the character archs in tact .  ,1
this movie was my first touch with mr sica so i really didn  t know what to expect . but what i saw just broke all my expectations  in a good way .  br    br   the storyline is not complex and shows us a life of found boy  orphan and particularly his connection into the community of poor people who together built themselves a hood of simple metal plate houses . this little city in another city lives own life and things are going fine . but one day there is a water resource found and a rich nobles man is getting interested in the buying the place . but as the title of the movie hints  there is a miracle taking place . our character gets a wonder dove from his dead mother . what is he going to do to protect his friends and all built city as well   br    br   it was just a masterpiece of natural comedy . there is shown the behavior of poor people and how money and property can talk and play with people . also many funny moments and scenes are included  at the beginning with the spot where sun is shining and many more .  br    br   so according to the fact that i m not a comedy lover you should see this movie because i liked it much  br    br   i  ,1
a romanticised and thoroughly false vision of unemployment from a middle class  artist  with a comfortable upbringing . . . it is clear that the writer  director never suffered unemployment directly and certainly has no personal experience of it . if you had to believe this absolutely ridiculous story  unemployed men of all ages behave like teenagers  have no anger  no fear  no frustration  etc . all the characters live trough the day by carrying pranks  boyish jokes . they do never look for work  the do almost never experience rejection or anguish  etc . living on the dole is just about like a summer vacation from school . . . ridiculous . specially if you compare it with contemporary masterpieces from the likes of ken loach  etc .  ,0
three part  horror  film with some guy in a boarded up house imploring the viewer not to go  out there  and  unfortunately  gives us three tales to prove why .  br    br   the first story involves a young couple in a car accident who meet up with two psychos . it leads up to two totally predictable twists . still  it  s quick  about   minutes   violent  well  acted and well  done . predictable but enjoyable .  br    br   the second involves a man on the run after stealing a large amount of money . his car breaks down  he  s attacked by a dog and stumbles into a nearby clinic . very obvious  badly done and extremely slow . even at   minutes this is too long . good acting though .  br    br   the third is just barely a horror story . it involves a beautiful  lonely woman looking for mr . right . it has beautiful set designs  a nice erotic feel and a nice sex scene . but  again  predictable and not even remotely scary .  br    br   it ends very stupidly .  br    br   all in all  the first one is worth watching  but that  s it . tune in for that one then turn it off .  ,0
the broadway musical   a chorus line  is arguably the best musical in theatre . it  s about the experiences of people who live for dance the joys they experience  and the sacrifices they make . each dancer is auditioning for parts in a broadway chorus line  yet what comes out of each of them are stories of how their lives led them find dance as a respite .  br    br   the film version  though  captures none of the passion or beauty of the stage show  and is arguably the worst film adaptation of a broadway musical  as it is lifeless and devoid of any affection for dance  whatsoever .  br    br   the biggest mistake was made in giving the director  s job to sir richard attenborough  whose direction offered just the right touch and pacing for  gandhi .  why would anyone in his or her right mind ask an epic director to direct a musical that takes place in a fairly constricted place   br    br   which brings us to the next problem .  a chorus line  takes place on stage in a theatre with no real sets and limited costume changes . it  s the least flashy of broadway musicals  and its simplicity was its glory . however  that doesn  t translate well to film  and no one really thought that it would . for that reason  the movie should have taken us in the lives of these dancers  and should have left the theatre and audition process . the singers could have offered their songs in other environments and even have offered flashbacks to their first ballet  jazz or tap class . heck  they could have danced down broadway in their lively imaginations . yet  not one shred of imagination went into the making of this film  as attenborough  s complete indifference for dance and the show itself is evident in his lackadaisical direction .  br    br   many scenes are downright awkward as the dancers tell their story to the director  michael douglas  whether he wants to hear them or not . douglas  character is capricious about choosing to whom he extends a sympathetic ear  and to whom he has no patience .  br    br   while the filmmakers pretended to be true to the nature of the play  some heretical changes were made . the very beautiful  hello twelve  hello thirteen  hello love    a smashing stage number which took the dancers back to their adolescence   was removed and replaced with the dreadful   surprise   a song so bad that it was nominated for an oscar . adding insult to injury   surprise  simply retold the same story as  hello  love  but without the wit or pathos .  br    br   there is no reason to see this film unless you want a lesson in what not to do when transferring a broadway show to film . if you want to see a film version of this show  the next closest thing is bob fosse  s brilliant  all that jazz .  while fosse  s daughter is in  a chorus line   he is the fosse who should have been involved  as director . he would have known what to do with this material  which deserved far greater respect than this sad effort .  ,0
  bread  very sharply skewers the conventions of horror movies in general and  night of the living dead  in specific and is constantly inventive . the production values are a little rough at times  it  s a student film  after all   but it never loses sight of its goal to entertain . hey   george romero liked it enough to include it on the remastered  dead  video tape  laserdisc and dvd . . . that should tell you something .  ,1
first of all  i apologize for my english .  br    br   everybody from ex  yugoslavia who isn  t some extreme serbian radical will agree with me . this movie  shows serbian side  and only serbian side . no serbian crimes were represented . luckily  everyone can see that this movie was made by serbians  so there is no neutrality . all   professionals   who were interviewed are not professionals at all . some guy only read a book written by some radical serbian  the other one is genocide denier etc . etc .  br    br   even slovenians were accused in this movie . and the whole war in slovenia lasted for few days  and only because slovenians were lucky . there weren  t many serbs in slovenia  and yna couldn  t reach slovenia trough croatia  after croatia  serbia war started  . every slovenian is outraged by all accusations in this movie .  br    br   every reasonable croat will agree with one thing the independence was too early . perhaps all major conflicts could be avoided . however  mentioning wwii and some unrelated things was truly pathetic attempt to justify everything . just imagine japanese throwing nuclear bombs at seattle and washington  and saying that was justified by hiroshima and nagasaki . you will find no evidence about strangled yna soldier  and murdered serbian civilians near vukovar . but you can find the tape with reporter committing that his claims about serbian civilians near vukovar were lies . all over the internet . and the director forgot to mention the whole bombing of vukovar by yna  now on serbian and montenegro side  and     full of serbs and montenegrin  and let  s not start about the chetnik movement . at the beginning  it was simply a resistance movement . but director somehow forgot to mention collaboration with the nazis  including ustashe  ethnic cleansing  and fighting again the yugoslav partisans . there are thousands of other things  but all of it can be easily checked . there are many misleading things in this movie . only few of all accusations are true . every croatian is outraged by this movie .  br    br   i believe that i don  t need to mention srebrenica genocide denial  the genocide that has too many evidence . imagine the movie about holocaust denial . this movie is the same . and according to this movie bosnian muslims in sarajevo bombed themselves . every bosnian muslim is outraged by this movie .  br    br   somehow director forgot to mention the short occupation of small piece of macedonian  fyrom  land by the serbs .  br    br   croatians  slovenians  bosnians  and macedonians never entered serbian borders . if you are not serbian and you actually started to believe some things from this movie  know that serbs have some kind of propaganda that croats  bosnian muslims  and macedonians are actually serbs who made up their history . so . . .  br    br   even    of serbs will say that this movie is   little   extreme and pro  serbian .  br    br   and serbian radicals are very  very pleased with this movie  there is about    serbs who vote for radicals  .  br    br   i think everyone understands my points in here . in this so called documentary is very little truth  and my advice to everyone is inform yourself before watching this movie . after that  you will only laugh at all pathetic accusations .  br    br   watch real  neutral documentaries about death of yugoslavia .  ,0
allen goes to the country  somewhere he hates going in real life  and has a weekend with his friends  which are the usual successful white middle  class bellyaching types that feature in many of his films .  br    br   i usually find something to amuse in woody allen comedies  but here he really falls totally flat on his face . even the one  liners seem to have deserted him . the really is no plot  bar bits and pieces of cod shakespeare   but allen seems to use the location to allow a semi  mystical air  which just makes the thing even more witless and half  baked .  br    br   it just doesn  t work at any level and is just a giant bore . the best thing about this film  apart from the end credits coming up  is that the bad reviews seem to get him to wake up and realise that simply throwing together a slapdash script and casting your mates in it doesn  t make for entertainment .  ,0
medellin is a fabulous place to live  work  and study . i  ve been there twice  and never did i hear anything about guerrilla activities  paramilitaries taking tourists hostage  or anything of the sort . there are  invisible police   but it is not a big brother system . there are just enough police so that they are visible in everyday life  but they do not hassle someone without good reasons .  br    br   la sierra is an interesting documentary in that the youths it depicts in the movie essentially become its characters . the directors of the movie carefully carve out plot lines among the daily actions of the inhabitants of la sierra  and when a  character  dies  there is genuine pathos . it is difficult to imagine  however  that the three youths are all members of the bloque metro  a gang that used to terrorize la sierra before the colombian government began to restructure the country .  br    br   la sierra is not an accurate depiction of life in colombia there are  of course  things to be wary of such as petty crime  but when one considers pickpocketing happens in  modern  cities such as london  new york  or tokyo  colombia doesn  t seem that different after all . colombians are eagerly awaiting their chance to show to the world that the once war  torn country is now prospering more than ever .  ,0
i am a big fan of fred macmurray and carole lombard . and  in addition to them  charles butterworth  a very enjoyable supporting actor  was in this film  . . . so why didn  t i particularly enjoy it   well  despite a good cast  this is one of the poorest written and most clichd  a pictures  i have ever seen . given the talent and money spent to make this film  it is shocking how slip  shod the writing was . i knew the film would be tedious when time after time early in the film i found myself predicting exactly what would happen next   and i was always right  and this isn  t because i am some sort of  movie savant   but was because almost no imagination or effort went into it . in fact  it seemed almost as if the film was just a long string of clichs all strung together  also  i found it a bit irritating that fred mistreated carole so bad throughout the film and yet  true to convention  she came running to him in the end . uggh  there is more suspense in a lassie film   will he bring people to rescue timmy or will the rope he is dangling from break    .  br    br   despite the very  very tired and clichd script  there were a few positives about the film . it was pretty cool seeing fred look like a broken lush at the end of the film   it was pretty believable and he looked like he hadn  t eaten  shaved or slept in days . also  charles butterworth  s  prattle  did provide a few mildly humorous moments . but all this just wasn  t enough to make this film look any different than a  b movie  . it  s a shame  . . . it could have been so much better .  ,0
could not understand why jeremy irons felt it necessary to exhibit a most disconcerting accent  spoken through clenched teeth  and from the back of his throat . in fact it rather spoiled the film for me  and distracted from what was probably a fine performance by him  very irritating  . no other actor or actress seemed to have such a pronounced accent and whilst i have always rated jeremy irons as a fine actor  i would not class this film as being one of his best . the film however has whetted my appetite  as have some of the other comments made re this film  which i have found very interesting  and intend to now read the book .  ,1

i had watched as much of the series as i could manage to watch on television  but unfortunately  started a job that got me working evenings . i managed to catch some recordings of it  at least . . . and  of course  purchased the recently released dvd of the complete series . watching the dvd  you can see that the animation was a bit more crude at first  but they ironed out a fair number of the flaws after the pilot was done . the voices are well suited to the characters  and the writing is excellent . it  s rather refreshing to see animation getting back to it  s roots by reintroducing adult themes . thing is  with the way society has come in the last century  you need to be a bit more blatant about it by today  s standards in order to be recognised as an adult  oriented show . the characters have very realistic personalities and are placed in situations that parallel what we often face in real life . it  s your typical sitcom in that regard  but the humor is more like what you  d expect from late night television like a talk show skit or saturday night live . . . back when snl was actually funny . good job  dreamworks . perhaps you need to work with one of the more liberal networks to keep this series going . . . and also improve the marketing of merchandise for the series to help defray it  s high costs . it  s a challenge to do this for a cartoon of a mature nature though . hmm . . .  ,1
i had two reasons for watching this swashbuckler when it aired on danish television yesterday . first of all  i wanted to see gina lollobrigida  and here i wasn  t disappointed . she looked gorgeous . second of all  through reading about the film i had gotten the impression that it featured absurd humor not unlike that which can be found in philippe de broca  s films . on this account  however  i was sadly disappointed . i found the jokes predictable  apart from a few witty remarks on the topic of war  and the characters completely one  dimensional . also  the action scenes were done in a strangely mechanical and uninspired fashion  with no sense of drama at all . i kept watching until the end  but i got bored very quickly and just sat there  waiting for the scenes with lollobrigida .  ,0
french film directors continue to amaze with their extraordinary ability to simulate the sights and sounds of ordinary  everyday suburban life . this was readily apparent with the release early in     of l  emploi du temps  time out   a brilliant character study of of a white collar worker  s descent into melancholy after having been fired from his job . as is the penchant of french filmmakers  many scenes were shot on real streets and in public places  giving a cinema verite feel to the story  yet l  emploi du temps also possessed an elegant look thanks to excellent camera work and some stunning location footage  most notably a swiss mountain retreat  . running fairly on the heels of that masterful movie comes another impressive french production  jacques audiard  s gritty crime caper  sur mes levres  read my lips  . actually  to tag this film a crime caper does it a disservice because it is so much more than that . as with the earlier french release  it is an incisive character study of marginal people using their wits to get ahead in a society that has turned its back on them . in a paris construction firm carla  a shy  diminutive young woman sits at her desk  sequestered to an area of the office that is a major pathway to the xerox machines and restrooms .  br    br   obnoxious coworkers use the front of carla  s desk to chat and drop off their half  finished styrofoam cups of coffee . partially deaf  carla turns her hearing aids on and off at will if noise becomes bothersome  be it the drone of the paper copiers or the shrill crying of a friend  s baby . when her boss calls her into the office to suggest that she hire a secretarial assistant to help her with the work load  carla fears she may lose her job . at the employment office carla lists the specifications she wants for her assistant  preferably male  as if she were at a personals agency . he should be   years old and clean  cut  with extensive computer and filing skills . when the agency sends over an unkempt  menacing looking young man  carla is both shocked and intrigued . they leave the office and have lunch at a local eatery  where carla interviews her prospective assistant . when she finds out that he has just gotten out of prison  carla initially wants nothing to do with paul  but has a change of heart and hires him on . although she is basically kind toward her helper  carla now finds herself in a position of authority and possessing a newfound sense of power . paul learns quickly and becomes an able worker . carla helps paul find a temporary place to live and even covers for him when his parole officer shows up one day at the office wondering why paul missed his appointment . during one of their lunch breaks carla informs paul of her hearing deficiency and reveals her ability to read lips . later  when an avaricious coworker blatantly takes over a project carla has been working on  a furious carla asks paul  s help in seeking revenge on the man . from here on in sur mes levres becomes an increasingly intense crime drama escalating into some of the most violently graphic scenes that have been shown on the screen in recent years . the screenplay borrows elements from hitchcock  most notably rear window  where carla  s lip  reading talent comes into full play using a pair of binoculars . there is a teasing  on  again  off  again sexual attraction between the two protagonists that culminates in a rather strange homage to north by northwest  but it works because of the considerable sexual heat that builds slowly between the two stars . that being said  what one carries away from this movie isn  t so much the similarities to classic hitchcock thrillers  although those elements are definitely there  but the pervasive view a of a modern day city  in this case paris  where life runs the gamut from mundane workdays to a boozy  garish nightlife where sex  drugs and laundered money infiltrate the lives of several characters . unlike hollywood productions  this is a psychological suspense yarn where the people look like the everyday man and woman on the street  where a punch in the face or groin sounds like a sickening thud and where the office is a place to be feared . it  s hitchcock with the gloves off .  ,1
this film has a powerful philosophical ending . but that ending has meaning only if you watch the movie from the beginning .  br    br   youth alienation in the late      s  from the viewpoint of a young man and a young woman  is the obvious theme of  zabriskie point  . neither mark frechette nor daria halprin had much acting experience  a fact that actually enhances the film  s message . having untrained actors conveys a sense of realism  as both players seem emotionally detached from the turmoil around them .  br    br   this is not a script  driven film . except for the first ten minutes  it is mostly visual  with stunning cinematography . the beautiful naturalistic images seem other  worldly  and perfectly in sync with the emotional detachment of mark and daria .  br    br   i would have replaced the thematically weak pink floyd music with the more cogent music of the doors . many scenes cry out for  riders on the storm  .  br    br   even so  i like this film . it  s different it  s unique it is artistic and imaginative . and the desert badlands are beautiful .  br    br   as the years go by   zabriskie point  seems more and more attractive . it conveys the mood of the late      s in america . it is amazingly artistic  in a bohemian sort of way . and the film  s last eight minutes are philosophically mesmerizing .  ,1
mina kumari exhibits more style and grace just moving from standing  to sitting on the floor than you can find in most other movies . the director has produced more memorable scenes of touching beauty than it would seem possible . the music and dancing is of the highest possible quality . you may notice in the first dance scene the director has all sorts of things occurring in the backgroundother girl dancing  a drunk falling down stairs  much activity  but he knew that we would be watching mina dance and i  ll bet unless you viewed this many times  you didn  t notice . all in all  perfection . j . q .  ,1
i  m not a steve carell fan however i like this movie about dan  an advice columnist  who goes to his parents house for a stay with his kids and ends up falling in love with his brother  s girlfriend . its a story thats been told before  but not like this . there are simply too many little bits that make the film better than it should be . the cast is wonderful  and even if carell is not my cup of tea  he is quite good as the widower who  s suppose to know everything but finds that knowing is different than feeling and that sometimes life surprises you . at times witty and wise in the way that an annoying hallmark card can be  the film still some how manages to grow on you and be something more than a run of the mill film . worth a look see  ,1

warning  this review will reveal the ending of the movie   scoop .  if you don  t want to know how the movie ends  don  t read this review   br    br    scoop  is so bad you  ll think  annie hall  was a fluke .  br    br   it gets one star because you get to see hugh jackman  s naked chest . that  s the only thing  scoop  has going for it .  br    br   woody allen  s misogyny  and his fixation on women young enough  at this point  to be his granddaughter  has crippled any ability to make movies he may have had at any point .  br    br   the plot seems promising a ghost  ian mcshane  directs a fluffy headed student  scarlett johansson  to investigate whether or not an english lord  hugh jackman  is the notorious tarot card killer of prostitutes . a magician  woody allen  helps the girl .  br    br   promising plot notwithstanding  the movie completely lacks charm  or humor  or atmosphere . it  s an amazingly leaden  amateurish effort for someone who has made even one previous film  never mind dozens . perhaps allen has had a stroke that has gone unreported in the press .  br    br   much is made of the fact that unlike in his previous films  woody allen  now a septuagenarian  has finally allowed a younger male lead to get the girl .  br    br   not so . in fact  the plot is constructed in such a way so that the girl gets no one .  br    br   there is an early scene where johansson  for no reason central to the movie  allows herself to be gotten drunk  and seduced  by a powerful  older director .  seduced  is a euphemism for what happens . it  s a  slam  bam  i  ve gotta go  kind of moment . it bears no relation to the plot whatsoever  and it cheapens johansson in the viewer  s eye . why did allen add that unnecessary scene to the movie  because it shows a powerful director  like allen  having sex with the female lead . allen gets to have his cake and eat it  too .  br    br   johansson is not yet an actress . she doesn  t know how to command the screen except by wearing a tight  low cut top . she imitates allen in a couple of scenes  and that just looks weird and sad .  br    br   it doesn  t help that her character is scripted as a doll who can  t function without a ghost  or an elderly and less than awe  inspiring magician  telling her what to do at every turn .  br    br   she is approximately half jackman  s age  and she comes across as a very vapid screen presence in their scenes together .  br    br   audience members not obsessed with breasts deserve better in their heroines  and jackman deserves better  too   a script that gives the heroine some intelligence and agency  and an actress who can convey those qualities .  br    br   hugh jackman is similarly cheated by the script . allen apparently can  t stand it that jackman is so stunningly good looking and young  and so he gives jackman nothing to say or do . like johansson  he is used merely for his good looks . this is a shame  because  as jackman has shown in any number of productions  from  oklahoma  to  x men   he can act .  br    br   here  s the big plot twist   jackman  suave  charming english lord  really is a killer . so  though the movie says it is all about letting someone else  other than allen  get the girl  she doesn  t get anyone . jackman  the man she  s been making love to  is a man who murdered a prostitute . nice  woody . nice way to punish your heroine for being beyond your grasp .  br    br   in a passive aggressive touch  allen deprives his heroine of his own presence  as well  killing off his character  the magician  leaving scarlett johansson all alone at the end of the film .  br    br   a final note at my screening  not a single audience member laughed at any point during the film . always a bad sign when a film is advertised as a comedy .  ,0
i started watching the show from the first season  and at the beginning i was pretty skeptical about it . original movie was kind of childish  and i was just looking for some sci  fi show while waiting for the bsg new season .  br    br   but after few episodes i became a fan . i  ve loved the characters  the not  so  stupid  as  you  think  he  is jack o  neill  the not  only  smart samantha carter  the glorious teal  c  women and kids favorite  and brilliant dr . daniel jackson .  br    br   of course  stories sometimes not serious  sometimes even ridiculous  but mostly it  s not about technology or space fighting  it  s about helping your friend  even risking your life for him . it  s about  we don  t leave anybody behind  . struggling to the end when all hope is lost . about the free will  and all good qualities that makes a human  human .  br    br   and now it  s breaking a record  going   th season  and still doing good .  ,1
picture the classic noir story lines infused with hyper  stylized black and white visuals of frank miller  s sin city . then picture a dystopian  science fiction thriller  such as steven spielberg  s minority report or richard linklater  s a scanner darkly . an amalgamation of the above would be a suitable way of describing visionary french director christian volckman  s bleak and atmospheric take on the future in his feature film debut . but although volckman  s work does unquestionably take reference from the aforementioned films and those similar to them  such a simplistic hybrid does not do renaissance  volckman  s end result  justice  the film itself is a far more complex piece of work than that .  br    br   genre hybridity is usually a hit and miss affair  especially in a contemporary context  with the well of individuality appearing to be increasingly exhausted . as such  renaissance is laudable as a cinematic experiment at the very least  with its unique interspersing of the gritty nihilism of the neo  noir detective thriller and the fantastic allegorical terror of the dystopian sci  fi drama  which serve to compliment each other  s storytelling conventions in a strangely fitting fashion . the screenplay is a clever and intriguing one  although one gets the sense that many of the lines in the script would have been much more effective in their original french than the english translation  the film  s title also becomes far more poignant  managing to stay one step ahead of its audience all the way through . though many elements of the plot will seem quite familiar to those who frequent such science fiction thrillers  the script throws unexpected twists and turns in at exactly the right moment to keep the viewer on their toes  making for a truly compelling work .  br    br   volckman  s film truly excels in its visual component  and the stunning black and white animation is easily the film  s highlight  superbly moody and stylish  it goes to show what tremendous aesthetic effect the simple use of two shades can have . with tremendous detail paid to the composition and look of each shot  and superb use of very noir shadows and intriguing angles to accentuate the emotional tension of the scene  the film appears straight out of a frank miller comic  but with a twist  the end result being consistently visually sumptuous .  br    br   the film  s english rendition is also given added credence by its very fitting array of voice casting . the gruff voice of daniel craig is an absolutely perfect piece of casting for grim  stoic policeman karas  and catherine mccormack is a strong presence as the mysterious woman whose sister  s disappearance he is investigating . despite a wavering english accent  romola garai does great work as the frantic sister in question  and jonathan pryce is suitably menacing as the shady head of ominous mega  corporation avalon . ian holm  s reedy voice is also a strong choice as a mysterious scientist  and holm makes a powerful impression in his brief scenes .  br    br   all together  renaissance boasts a visually stunning  unique and compelling futuristic thriller  just as intelligent as it is entertaining . though the plot may seem familiar to those who frequent such fare and the occasional weak line may inhibit the film from being the moody masterpiece it set out to be  the superb animation in itself easily carries the film through its occasional qualms . for fans of either of the film  s intertwined genres or the gritty graphic novels of frank miller  or those willing to appreciate a capably crafted  slightly less conventional take on the futuristic thriller  the film is without question worth a watch .  br    br         ,1

the film did what it set out to do show how a young girl copes with poverty and grows into her maturity . however  for most of us  this subject has been explored adequately and in most instances with more sophistication than done here . the movie fixated on breasts  which soon became boring and i lost interest . if this was on tv  i would  ve switched to the latest news on the starr report . that  s how boring i found this movie .  ,0
a hilarious and insightful perspective of the dating world is portrayed in this off beat comedy by first time writer  director peter m . cohen . the story unfolds as the four male protagonists meet weekly at the local diner to confer about their dating woes . we meet brad a good  looking  wall  street playboy with a quick  wit and sharp tongue zeek a cynical  sensitive writer jonathan a sexually perplexed nice guy with an affinity for hand creams and masturbation and eric the married guy  who cherishes his weekly encounters with his single friends in hope for some enlightenment to his boring and banal married existence . the trials and tribulations of the men  s single lives in new york are amusingly expressed  mirroring that of sex in the city and hbo  s new comedy the mind of married man  and bring an astute light to scamming . the story takes a twist as the three singletons meet mia   wittily played by amanda peet  and all fall for her . she seduces them each with her uncanny ability to conform to the personalities  they exhibit . when they come to realize they have all met and fallen in love with the same woman  they chose her over their friendship . whipped is a realistic portrayal of the dating world  one that the critic  s failed to recognize . in plain language  they missed the point . the protagonist  s here are caricatures of real people . the exaggerations are hysterical  mixing satire and humility  and are not to be taken as seriously as the critic  s disparagement suggests . see this movie  you  ll laugh from start to finish .  ,1
this film could well have been one of those ordinary  soapies  relating the day to day events of half a dozen families whose lives are intertwined . . broken relationships  building new friendships  street bashings  near accidents  hopes and dreams and even the discovery of a baby discarded under some bushes  what a mixture of events   br    br   fortunately the film maker goes beyond those daily events and poses questions to consider although there are no satisfactory answers . he asksin this chaotic world do things just happen  is it just luck when things turn out right or  taking a fatalistic view  is a person predestined to be at a certain place at a certain time and thus become involved in the event and his future takes on a new perspective  most of us have had this uncanny experience .  br    br   is it our super ego that makes us believe we are so important  as one character says he once sat on the edge overlooking the grand canyon and came to realize how infinitely small he was .  br    br   this is not one of my favourite films but is a good study of human relationships . danny glover is outstanding in a sympathetic role .  ,1
all of the x  men movies were great . and i mean all of them  including the long hated x  men  . they had solid characters  magneto and xavier were the best ones  in my opinion   and a good story arch .  br    br   i was all excited when i heard this movie was on production  and my expectations grew bigger and bigger until i saw the movie . i was so disappointed .  br    br   hugh jackman is not a bad actor  his best movie is the fountain  although you won  t hear about this movie when they talk about the actor   and his acting is not what screws the movie up .  br    br   the whole film is plagued with lots of meaningless characters that add nothing to the plot  like blob or gambit   which were tossed there to make fans believe that the film makers had read the original comics .  br    br   i am a fan of xmen  i have read many  many of their stories and this movie respected none of them . none . not even the continuity . it doesn  t respect weapon x project  or the relationship between wolverine and sabretooth  or emma frost  the motivations for wolverine are plain stupid and seen in millions of movies revenge for the death of a loved one .  br    br   oh . what i was expecting the whole darn movie was a berseker moment for wolverine similar to the one he has in x  in the school when stryker men come in and he alone decimates the enemy forces  but hey  this is fox  this a family flick and you will not see explicit violence from the most violent and gruesome marvel hero .  br    br   besides  i had a feeling of constant dej v with this movie because wolverine  s origins are already explained in x   we already know how he got his adamantium skeleton so it kind of does not make sense to make a movie of something we already know .  br    br   i personally believe that wolverine is one of those few characters that does not need a solid back  story because mystery is the nature of the character . do we really want to know how the joker got his scars   ,0
in a year of pretentious muck like  synecdoche  new york  a film born out of charlie kaufman  s own self  indulgence  comes a film that is similarly hard to watch but about three times as important .  frownland  is a labor of love by the crew  the actors and the filmmaker  shot over years by friends . it traces a man who cannot communicate through his thoroughly authentic  real brooklyn world . the people that you see are a step beyond even the stylization of the  mumblecore  movement . they are real people  painfully trapped in their own self  contained neuroses  unwilling to change  unable . the real world to them is their own set of delusions and because this is a film about people who are so profoundly out of touch  it is very difficult to watch . it is   mm film  making without proper light  money or any of the other factors that would make a film  slick   but its honesty can not be understated  a fact that would cause a room full of people to dismiss it and for richard linklater to give it an award as he did at sxsw . this does remind of films like  naked  or the best of the  mumblecore  . it is a film that is not for everyone  but one that challenges you to watch and grows on you the longer you think about it .  ,1
this film  though ostensibly a comedy  is deadly serious . its subject is imperialism  with a capital i   how britain  foolishly  humiliatingly  tries to convince itself that it  s still a great power after world war ii . at home  the empire is run by amiable dolts  benevolent tories who are so in  bred that they can  t distinguish close relatives the offices of government consist of long forgotten archives  a dig at orwellian paranoia    inhabited by indolent rats  and ante  rooms wherein lounge bored synacures  reading popular novels .  br    br   abroad  britain clings to the old pomp but pomp out of context looks threadbare and silly  especially when its embodied in bumbling twits . carlton  browne is an unsentimental picture of decline  with none of the lachrymose rot that marred the supposedly anti  imperialist jewel in the crown .  br    br   the film is also about the cold war  bravely admitting that it  s a dangerous farce  whose participants deserve mockery and contempt  not fear and respect . it  s about how colonialism  characterised more by neglect than tyranny  destroys the colonies it deserts  robbing them of amenities  power  and  most importantly  self  respect  leaving them vulnerable to the machinations of dangerous cowboys .  br    br   it  s the seriousness  of course  that kills it . that  s not to say that weighty subjects can  t be treated in comedy  the miracle of morgan  s creek  dr . strangelove and the life of brian have all proved that . indeed  one might suggest that serious themes should only be treated by comedy  it allows for a clearer  eyed view .  br    br   the problem with carlton  browne is that every situation must have a significance beyond the merely comic  so that it becomes weighed down and unfunny . in the three films mentioned above  much of the comedy arises from character reaction to an extreme situation  not the extreme situation itself . here  the script is too poor to sustain rich comic characterisations  and some of the greatest comedy talent ever assembled  peter sellers  terry  thomas  raymond huntley and john le mesurier  are criminally wasted .  br    br   terry  thomas  sublime so often  shows that he couldn  t handle lead parts  and that he needed to play sneering  arrogant bounders  not brainless toffs . the music is made to carry much of the comedy  but its heavy irony only draws attention to the lack of hilarity on screen .  to be fair  unlike the majority of british comedies of the period  which were stagy and underproduced  the boultings often try to make their points through film itself  by montage and composition  only huntley manages to raise genuine laughs  and that  s by essaying a character he could have played in his sleep .  br    br   none of the boultings  farces have dated well  they  re never thought through enough . although carlton  browne revels in the decline of the empire  it also seems to be anti  democratic and militaristic . i  m sure this wasn  t intended  but these blunders are bound to happen if you allow worthy intentions to take precedence over comic intelligence and film form .  ,0
this film was a critical and box  office fiasco back in     . it was based on a novel which was later turned into a play   which flopped on broadway . the story is about some navy officers on leave in san francisco during wwii . they have  day  s leave which they spend at the mark hopkins hotel . the film meanders a lot and none of the characters seem very real . cary grant is generally brilliant in comedy and drama   but here he plays a sort of wheeler dealer and he doesn  t really pull it off . tony curtis or james garner would have been better choices . audrey hepburn was initially set to play opposite grant  but had other commitments   so suzy parker stepped in . she had never acted before  but was america  s top photographic model at the time . i think that she did a good job  considering all the pressure that she was under . grant  s pairing with jayne mansfield in a few brief scenes   did not really work . the studio was trying to give her some class by acting with grant   but the character had no substance at all .  ,0
alex winter and keanu reeves return as the two dopes from san dimas who get sent on another trip of a lifetime as someone from the future feels exactly the opposite the way it was presented in the first movie .  br    br   the only difference is that their trip is  somewhere  between heaven and hell and ends up being both . when they meet the grim reaper  they get the chance of an after  lifetime to play him for a chance to return and stop two evil robots from ruining what future they were supposed to have . besides playing roles they have . . . er . . . perfected  they also play  and revive a couple of extra sales in the process  some classic games  i even have my original copy of battleship in the closet  .  br    br   the reason i liked this movie better than the original is because it deals with  what it might be like  instead of  what was .  without spoiling the movie  i can  t give you anymore information about this  i guess you  ll just have to watch them both and decide for yourself   out of   stars .  ,1
i  m embarrassed to be writing this review . i say that because those of you reading it will know that i sat through the whole thing and that is embarrassing to admit even to strangers . but i just had to warn those who read the viewer comments on imdb before they watch a film not to watch this one . it  s the least i can do . this is a bad movie  trust me . the plot is goofy . the acting is amateurish . and the directing  camera work  sets  costumes  etc . are all second rate . let it go .  ,0
several years ago when i first watched  grey gardens  i remember laughing and finding it hilarious camp . years later i still laugh out loud when i watch it  but after many viewings i  ve come to see the beauty in the strange  twisted relationship between the inseparable  big  edith bouvier beale and her daughter  little  edith bouvier beale .  br    br   mother and daughter living together in their decaying   room east hampton mansion add a whole new meaning to the term  shabby chic  . with innumerable cats  raccoons and opossums as roommates this aunt and niece of jackie o . allowed filmmakers albert and david maysles into their mansion to film them living life day to day . the result is a hilarious  beautiful  sad and moving account of true love and anarchy rule .  br    br   the relationship between big and little edie is a testament to the unbreakable bonds of love . and their lives an example of drive  determination and free  will . this movie has more to recommend it than i can put down into words . it is a rare experience that you must see for yourself .  br    br    ,1
this movie is about a female rape victim  comic book writer from new york that decides to get away from all that awful big city glamor and move to a dirty  run down small town where she finds refuge in a single  wide trailer on a dirt lot in the middle of   th and nowhere . the townspeople are mentally ill  yet so is she for inviting crazy men into her trailer . annoying is the fact that she has the ability to do exactly the right thing to place herself in dangerous circumstance after dangerous circumstance . db sweeney  s performance was high school at best . he  s one of those kinda  cute young actors with a sweet grin . unfortunately career has not been kind and mother nature has been right in tow . to the previous commentator stating that the acting was  so real   well i agree . actually it wasn  t acting . the two main characters really are pathetic  weak and incapable of making mature  healthy decisions . in brief  this movie sucks like no other  rent it to laugh at it . the real crime scene  the atrocious wood paneling in the trailer  enough to make me commit murder . and lastly  she  s a artist  writer  so couldn  t she afford a double  wide trailer and something other than a sun  yellow chevy chevette for love of god   ,0
this movie was disappointing . it was incomplete and dull . while alec baldwin tried to portray himself as the perfect fair and just prosecutor  not to mention executive producer   the movie never showed any of the defense counsels or tried to challenge the audience with an actual meaningful debate on the subject of how a country could be led down such a terrible path .  br    br   sure  nobody wants to defend the nazi  s point of view  but that was the point of the nuremberg trails  four hours of simply bashing on the nazi  s . . . . c  mon  thats been done already   br    br   i really think alec baldwin should just stick to being kim bassinger  s husband .  br    br   right after the movie ended  tnt showed the     movie  trail at nuremberg . that movie is far superior .  ,0
worst de niro scorsese collaboration in this horrible agonizing violent overlong mess . scorsese is totally out of his element in this film with the horror cliched suddenly loud phone ringing and door slamming gimmicks that seem laughable and embarrassing coming from such a master craftsman . the cast is totally wasted here and the southern accents are very annoying and forced . nick noltie plays the wimpiest lawyer in history who would ever believe he can defend anyone  de niro  s psychotic bowden is nothing more than the typical    s movie psycho killer . the scene with de niro and lewis early on is very awkward and the climax goes on and on and we should all be more than tired of the on psycho stalker that never dies . one of my most horrible movie experiences . rent the original it  s    times better .  br    br    ,0
if you are looking for a definitive biography of the life of boxer james corbett  then this is probably not the film for you . the famed boxer receives a     s  hollywood  ization  of his life   making the story far more entertaining and engaging than real life . however  because the performances were so good  particularly by errol flynn  and the script so likable  the film  s embellishments can be forgiven .  br    br   errol flynn plays gay nineties  era boxer james  gentleman jim  corbett   a man who became world boxing champ in     . the film goes from his rather humble beginnings and follows his through his career through him winning the title match against john l . sullivan . however  while it could have focused mostly on the matches  most are rather brief in the film  except for the final title match  and the emphasis is on corbett  s brash personality as well as his relationship with the lady played by alexis smith . throughout the film  there is excellent supporting work done by a cast of wonderful supporting actors  such as the perennial supporting actor in flynn films  alan hale  and the writing really helped bring these people alive .  br    br   what is particularly nice about the film is seeing the athleticism of flynn as a boxer . while a few of the shots are of doubles  almost all the boxing scenes are of flynn and he did a convincing job as a pugilist . this was a nice departure for flynn  who generally played  pretty boy  roles or swashbucklers and this shows just how tough a character he was . to find out more about this  try reading a biography of him   he was quite the rough and tumble character before coming to hollywood .  br    br   now as for the real james corbett  read on if you aren  t afraid of finding out how the movie isn  t accurate . first  corbett was not a poor guy coming from a poor family  but was college educated and bright . second  while he did get alexis smith at the end of the film  they also divorced a few years later . third  the wonderfully touching final scene of the film between sullivan and corbett was probably the best part of the film  sullivan was a jerk and this never could have happened   in reality  sullivan was more the egomaniac and corbett was not the fat  headed guy they portrayed in the film   though it made for a lovely film .  ,1
overshadowed by  braveheart  released the same year  the two costume dramas beg comparison . i admit my bias against mel gibson  yet i maintain a rational preference for  rob roy .  both  braveheart  and  rob roy  compellingly depict scots history in bloody  romantic fashion .  braveheart  is an epic paean to individual honor and courage and a fine revenge fantasy . it  s also melodramatic  anachronistic and maudlin . note its cornball usage of slow motion filming . its violence is both ugly and glorious . it is the latter quality which makes it more appealing to the adolescent mindset . while  braveheart  surpasses  rob roy  in sheer levels of carnage  not to mention its indulgent running time   the latter film is ultimately more mature and satisfying . its action is more understated  yet more surprising and clever . its sex is less showy  yet more erotic .  rob roy  also has a better realized romantic interest . its dialog attempts to approximate the poetry of the period . its rotted teeth in the mouths of the actors attempt to approximate the dentistry of the era . and tim roth is a superlative villain . also recommended  the last of the mohicans  and  the patriot .  you may find the latter more akin to  braveheart  with its emphasis on blood lust  with the former more similar to  rob roy  in tone . all the of the aforementioned movies merit their r ratings for violence .  ,1
synopsis the future as seen from     england . as war loomed over europe  the salvation of mankind will not be found in the politics of the past . it is up to the brave new world of science to overcome man  s past mistakes .  br    br   concept in relation to the viewer beware your leaders and what you are told . thinking outside the box can lead to a brighter tomorrow . there will always be descent and fear  and learning to overcome it is our only hope .  br    br   pros and cons i had seen this film long ago and recently downloaded it off of the internet  it is in the public domain  . this is a fascinating work on numerous levels . since it is a story about the future as seen from      it has obvious flaws . this vision of the future is both terrifying and whimsical . this film was cutting edge for its day . the special effects are very good as is the story line . the acting suffers a bit in the british theatrical sense  in that it can lean a bit toward shakespeare .  br    br   one of the underlying themes of the film is that science and technology can solve all our problems  which we now know is not always true . the films other plot line is that charismatic leaders are a curse of human existence and will probably always be with us .  br    br   the underpinnings of almost all later science fiction movies can be seen in this film . the set design and wardrobe of  forbidden planet   the failings of technology in       a space odessy   even the lush landscapes  cityscapes of  star wars  owe some amount of inspiration to this film .  br    br   the ending of the film leaves the viewer a bit perplexed . while it is optimistic in its ending sequence of reaching for the stars  we are left to wonder if mankind will ever be able to make it . even as we reach  there are those that are trying to hold us back . this films vision of the future while interesting is also a bit humorous by todays standards . huge flying machines and guns that could shoot people into space never materialized in the real world  but in     they were considered the next logical step .  br    br   many great british actors are in this film as young men . cedric hardwicke and ralph richardson are the most recognized and their oratory skills are evident here . raymond massey is a curious choice to play the lead character  cabel . his character almost comes across as the new christ sent to save the world from its own destruction with the new religion of science .  br    br   this is a good piece of cinema history whose themes are still relevant today even if its vision of the future missed the mark .  ,1
this was a great movie with a good cast  all of them hitting on all cylinders . and when dianne keaton is at her best  well  it just doesn  t get any better than that . but tom everett scott  always underrated  was even better . he should be a star .  br    br   my only complaint is with one aspect of the screenplay . none of the characters ever acknowledged that the dead daughter wasn  t always a good person . and neither was her mother  played by keaton . at one point she breaks a promise she made to one character not to reveal that he had been sleeping around .  br    br   one of the other commentators said the movie had a  political agenda  . that is a baffling thing to say . there was no politics at all in this movie .  ,1
imagine that in adapting a james bond novel into a movie  the filmmakers eliminated all the action and suspense in order to make it kid  friendly . or if a television producer told chris rock he couldn  t cuss so that his specials could be rated pg . in the same way  the director of the movie  something wicked this way comes  took out the excitement and gore in favor of melodrama for younger audiences . this created a monotonous plot without the complications of the book . in trying to make the story of  something wicked this way comes  easier for children to follow  the filmmakers eliminated the theme of good and evil both existing in everyone  and good always prevailing over evil . this is apparent in will  s character transformation  charles halloway  s rescue of jim  and the carnival  s defeat .  br    br   will  s transformation into a more adventurous boy has been muted in the movie . the scene in which the dust witch visits will  s house in a balloon has been cut from the film . instead  a green mist follows jim and will home and gives them the same bad dream about the witch and her spiders . the balloon attack shows us that will has begun to conquer his fear of doing things on his own . he gets on top of a neighbor  s roof and tears the balloon with a bow  defeating the witch .  sorry  dad  he thought  and sat up  smiling . this time it  s me out  alone   will decides as he prepares to face her     .  removing this scene from the movie prevents us from understanding that will is becoming more adventuresome . the film shows us many examples of will being afraid to follow jim  but never growing curious like his friend . in the book  will has both a good  quiet side and an  evil   daring side like his jim . in the movie  each boy only has one mode of thought  which destroys bradbury  s theme of both good and evil being present in each person .  br    br   in the book  will saves jim because of their friendship  but  in the movie  charles halloway saves jim to repay jim  s father . will pulls jim off the carousel in bradbury  s novel because he doesn  t want his best friend to grow up without him . it is the good in will  the fact that he cares about his friend  that saves jim from the evil curse of the carnival . on the carousel  jim  gestured his other hand free to trail on the wind  the one part of him  the small  white  separate part that still remembered their friendship      .  this shows that there was good left inside of jim  which has the potential to still defeat evil . but when charles halloway saves jim in the movie  he does it to repay the debt he owes jim  s father  who saved will when he was a little boy . by changing the motivation for saving jim  the filmmakers have ruined bradbury  s original idea that it takes good to win against evil .  br    br   in the end of the movie  the carnival is defeated by a tornado and lightning instead of smiles and laughter . when the book ends  mr . dark turns himself into a little boy and charles halloway smiles and laughs at him so much that he can  t stand it and evaporates . in bradbury  s world  evil people feed off fear and can only be defeated by happiness and love . his message is that good will always prevail over evil  but only if that goodness is expressed outwardly .  good to evil seems evil   says charles halloway as he holds the dying mr . dark .  so i will do only good to you  jed . i  ll simply hold you and watch you poison yourself      .  in the movie  mr . dark is the only one left on the carousel when lightning hits it  and he dies . by eliminating the weapon of laughter and smiles  the filmmakers imply that bad weather is the most effective way to defeat evil  as if lightning only strikes those who are bad . this takes away the major theme of bradbury  s book  which is that doing  good  toward others wards off evil .  br    br   good may always triumph over evil  but trying to make movies more kid  friendly will always force filmmakers to leave out some of the themes from the books they are based on . in the movie   something wicked this way comes   will does not transform  will  s friendship does not save jim  and smiles and laughter do not defeat the carnival . as a result  the filmmakers have left out too many of bradbury  s main points . the process of adapting a book to a movie too often ruins the world the author has established . in the case of this story  bradbury  s frightening world of opposing forces of good and evil has been reduced to a tamer  simpler version of itself .  ,0
antonio margheriti  s  danza macabra    castle of blood  is an eerie  atmospheric chiller that succeeds on all fronts . it looks absolutely beautiful in black  white and it has wonderfully creepy gothic vibe . alan foster is an english journalist who pursues an interview with visiting american horror writer edgar allan poe . poe bets foster that he can  t spend one night in the abandoned mansion of poe  s friend  thomas blackwood . accepting the wager  foster is locked in the mansion and the horror begins  the film is extremely atmospheric and it scared the hell out of me . the crypt sequence is really eerie and the tension is almost unbearable . barbara steele looks incredibly beautiful as sinister specter elisabeth blackwood .  castle of blood  is easily one of the best italian horror movies made in early    s . a masterpiece   ,1
not really spoilers in my opinion  but i wanted to cover myself  nevertheless . as the executive producer  morgan freeman wants the audience to ignore the numerous absurdities of his character in   items or less  a movie with an intentional indie  feel  and just be absorbed in the mentor  be  all  that  you  can  be theme . he plays a alternate universe  semi  washed up version of the real morgan freeman  who is chauffeured in an old econovan by a kid all the way into carson  ca from brentwood to research his next movie role . why carson  is a mystery to so . cal residents . he could have saved the trip and gone anywhere in the san fernando valley and found the same elements . paz vega is pretty to watch  a cross between salma hayek and penelope cruz  playing a disgruntled grocery checker at a large but slow local market that apparently is the ultimate source for moragn freeman  s research . his character is only known as  him  to allude to how actors are regarded when encountered in real life by average people   psst  that  s  him   etc . unfortunately  i was too distracted that him had all kinds of worldly wisdom and advice but had no reliable return back to his home in brentwood  carried no cash or debit card  or had the wisdom to keep a cell phone with him . if one has such a high opinion of their self that they believe they possess an answer to everything like him does  then i gotta see cash and a blackberry which displays intelligence and good survival instincts to preserve that big ego which him definitely has . nothing really happens in this movie . i don  t believe that either of the main character  s were substantially changed by their encounter with each other . it flirts with the idea of adultery  but then that thought fizzles . this to me was similar to steve martin  s shopgirl  without the sexual affair . it was self  indulgent for freeman and unconvincing to the audience .  ,0
an interesting idea for a film  both showing the last dragon on earth and showing the struggle he and someone evil have together . when he was younger  einon got stabbed in the heart  so bowen  dennis quaid  took him to the dark lord who gave him half his heart . now grown up einon  david thewlis  is now the selfish and evil king . meanwhile  bowen is using a new friend draco the dragon  voiced by sir sean connery  to get rewards for  killing  dragons . but because einon has half of draco  s hear  they both feel the pain in one of them is hurt  or killed . also starring pete postlethwaite as gilbert of glockenspur  jason isaacs as lord felton  julie christie as queen aislinn and john gielgud as king arthur . it was nominated for the oscar for best visual effects . worth watching   ,0
this version is likely available at your local dollar store on dvd . the print is not great  nor is the sound  but if you have   .   and   or so minutes to spare  you  ll get your money  s worth  which is not saying an awful lot  . anna neagle is extremely vapid as nanette . whatever her charms may have been back in the day  they are not evident in this film . a great number of fine character actors appear in this film  helen broderick  zasu pitts  even arden   but the material falls remarkably short of their talents . still  it is interesting to see how such accomplished performers make the most of the weak writing . the musical numbers  there are really only two  are quite horrible . clearly the studio did not feel compelled to cash in on the rich musicality of the original  no  no  nanette  . for what it  s worth  the dvd can be had for   .   . it  s worth that much just to say you  ve seen it .  ,0
i wanted to like this film  i really did . it  s got some good actors but ultimately it falls flat . it tries too hard to be funny in some places  the daughters over zealous cooking attempts   over reaches in others  the scene where they clean up someone  s yard  so he agrees to join the team  and has some scenes that  while mildly interesting  are really just filler  all the work scene  s  . and i didn  t find the  villians  intimidating  or worth hating  so much as i found them to be childishly annoying .  br    br   i  ve met people like those in the film while playing church ball . and i will say the referee  s are spot on  still  in the end  i really didn  t care all that much about the characters  or their quest for church ball glory . maybe because they were all so one dimensional  which i might not have minded so much if the film were funnier or seemed to flow a little more smoothly overall .  br    br   kurt hale  and halestorm entertainment  has made some good films  but this is not one of them .  ,0
minor spoilers  br    br   i am  like many others  a huge jerry bruckheimer fan . so when i saw all the beautiful posters hanging out front  and the trailer coming by before mi   expectations were rising . a jerry bruckheimer production . big cars . nic cage and fresh from an oscar  angelina jolie . what can possibly go wrong  a lot .  br    br   the script is neither funny  which it tries really hard to be  nor exciting . you put in a black person who is constantly making racist jokes about himself and wooh  haa   you  ve got comedy  i don  t think so . excitement is totally out of the picture . first of all  and this is probably said many times  there are no sympathetic characters so who cares who gets killed  if you can stomach the premise that a psycho is gonna kill nic  s brother unless he steals   cars in  days  next thing you know is that kip  the brother  is walking with nic in the streets again . is this excitement  think not . then comes the best bit  the romance between nic and angelina . she actually looks bored having to utter all these stupid lines to nic .  do you have a girlfriend    are you seeing anybody    what went wrong   etc .  br    br   then there  s only one sparkle of hope left the car chases . they  re disappointing to say the least  because the trailer made it look like it was full of them  and there  s only one . a very long one  caught in irritatingly hectic camera movement . i really had trouble following the action .  br    br   so is it an action movie  a thriller  a romantic comedy   there  s no need to decide  just avoid this horrible mess . i  ll give  out of   stars  and i feel like i  m being generous .  ,0
one of frances farmer  s earliest movies at    she is absolutely beautiful . bing crosby is in great voice  but the songs are not his best . martha raye and bob burns are interesting  but their comedy  probably great in its time  is really corny today . roy rogers also appears  in a singing role . in my view only worth watching if you are a frances farmer fan  and possibly a bing crosby fan .  ,0
a group of models is seeking an apartment to live in  and are shown one by a local real estate agent . unknown to the models and the agent  however  is that  hell  s threshold  is in the apartment and when crossed  the demon  dethman  is summoned to kill all those in his path . the story is told by sam bishop  a journalist who was accused of the murders .  br    br   although i am a champion of low budget  microbudget  and independent films  i cannot praise this movie . the creators take pride in their    hour shooting schedule and at least one actor boasts on the dvd of his acting prowess  but i cannot wrap my head around this . why make a film in   hours if an extra one or two hours of editing would make all the difference  and why pride yourself on acting that is poor  nonsensical and results in the bad delivery of a handful of lines   br    br   through much of the film  the models are being shown parts of an apartment by a real estate agent . the dialog is clearly ad  libbed because no scriptwriter could come up with such empty diction . the agent  also  clearly knows nothing about housing . . . she focuses on aspects of a home that no one could care about  incorrectly explains the heat source  didn  t she see the radiator   and says the vermin problem will be solved when they call  the terminator  . please  write a script   some deviation is fine  but this was a mess .  br    br   and why were the girls moving in models  their careers had no point in the plot  and this seems like a forced situation . at one point  an actress breaks character and says something to the effect of  dude  they  re going to be  upset   which sounded more natural than any other line  though out of place because of the other bad dialog .  br    br   the demon made no sense . i appreciated the attempt to explain how  hell  s threshold  jumps to random places on earth  including apartment fireplaces   but why not explain where the demon came from  his background involves a man whose love is killed by another man . how does this make you a demon   also  why did we need all these victorian flashbacks with no dialog and glances across a field  it was overdone .   br    br   the dramatic pauses between lines was awful . the sam bishop character was by far the worst  with the interviewer not far behind . does every question require a pause  a funny face and a response . . . followed by a pause  a funny face and a response  i was so frustrated . to me  the only point was to drag the time out . . . but i  d rather have thirty minutes of good delivery than an hour of horrible delivery  and then more time is wasted by rolling through the same credits twice  .  br    br   who was the sam bishop character  anyway  allegedly he  saw  all this and was accused of killing the girls  but yet at no point was he ever in the part of the tale with the girls . so how did he see them  and if he didn  t  how did he know dethman killed them  and if he didn  t see dethman  how does he know dethman is the spirit of apostoles  i was so lost . . . was there even an outline for a plot when this was written   br    br   the only part i found enjoyable in this movie was a scene with one of the models in the bathroom . not that it was really important or anything  but it was the only break from boredom i was given . i wonder what director felix diaz was thinking . his music is very good  see the dvd behind the scenes for his impromptu playing   but i wonder about his movie making skills . although  by far the best part of the dvd was the trailer for his  superhero excelsior   the trailer alone was better than this entire waste of time  .  br    br   i am sorry i have to be so harsh . i  d like to think that this movie was a test of what can be done in   hours or maybe just an experiment for fun and the idea was never to make a quality film . but if  superhero excelsior  is any indication  diaz can make quality . . . so why did he choose to avoid that here  perhaps the world will never know .  ,0
i saw virtually no redeeming qualities in this movie . the only thing i did see was quentin tarantino  s seeming insane obsession for it . . . there were some attractive women in this movie and perhaps that is one decent quality . overall however  i found this movie surrealistic and ridiculous . the hand held film making coupled with slow motion and other cinematic gimmicks i found clumsy and dizzying  even sickening . overall the music throughout was horrible and repetitive to the extreme as well reminding me of psychological warfare of the u . s . military against various malcontents .  br    br   the various vignettes that made up the movie are haphazard in their placement and unfulfilling and unresolved in their content and  conclusions .  a depressing movie  not a true  film   a term i reserve for true art  that left me with a bad feeling . do not believe the various people that try and spin this as a  romantic comedy  though there are certainly isolated elements of both this movie repudiates in content  form  and conclusion any association with this genre .  br    br   i suggest staying far away notwithstanding the seemingly overwhelming positive views of imdb and other ratings sources .  ,0
i gave this movie a very fair chance  and it betrayed me . this is very little more than a black and white excuse to bore the hell out of the audience even as the egotist bogdanavich  who did way better with targets  gets  great performances  out of a ton of hams in their debuts . lots of teenage sex clichs come out of this movie  such as doing the teacher  s wife  impotence  doing the ugly prostitute  which is very awkwardly shot and grinds things to a complete halt  not that things were really going anywhere anyway  and skinny dipping .  br    br   i suppose this movie is supposed to be funny because of all the sex nonsense  to me  it was just annoying . i was seriously much more entertained by cleaning my finger nails than watching this mess .  ,0
even worse than the worst david lynch  confusathon    brain dead  makes no sense whatsoever . shamefully wasted talent  bill pullman  bill paxton   bounce around like they are in a  tom and jerry  cartoon on acid . there is negligible character development . it simply starts climbing the  strange scale   until climaxing in total chaos . do not get sucked into this because of the above fine actors . they are given nothing to work with  and you will be wondering what  s going on throughout the entire  unbearable   minutes . i highly recommend avoiding  brain dead  at all costs  unless you are into scattering your brain into total nonsense .  merk  ,0
well  you know the rest  this has to be the worst movie i  ve seen in a long long time . i can only imagine that stephanie beaham had some bills to pay when taking on this role .  br    br   the lead role is played by  to me  a complete unknown and i would imagine disappeared right back into obscurity right after this turkey .  br    br   bruce lee led the martial arts charge in the early    s and since then fight scenes have to be either martial arts based or at least brutal if using street fighting techniques . this movie uses fast cuts to show off the martial arts  however  even this can  t disguise the fact that the lady doesn  t know how to throw a punch . an average  year old boy would take her apart on this showing .  br    br   sorry  the only mystery on show here is how this didn  t win the golden raspberry for its year .  ,0
first of all  i have to start this comment by saying i  m a huge nightmare on elm street fan . i think it  s the greatest horror series ever . for me  freddy is the boogeyman  of course  freddy  s dead  which tried to be the last chapter back then  is a weird movie . it doesn  t have the same atmosphere than the previous films . freddy has a lot of screen time . some think it makes him less scary  which i do agree . and that  s  in my opinion  exactly the point . this movie exists so we can know freddy a little better  who he is  who he were  how he became the man haunting our dreams . for some people  it  s a bad thing  it  s better if we never know because it  s scarier not to know why evil is evil . obviously those people won  t like rob zombie  s remake of halloween . to truly enjoy this one  you have to see things differently . it  s not about a strange guy hiding in the bush of your dreamland waiting to scare the hell out of you . this was the first one  and it was awesome . as the years passed by  freddy killed more and more people  and nobody could ever get rid of him for good . now it  s time to learn about the nature of this evil  the psychological aspects of freddy  s realm of terror . beside the story of freddy  s past  i also really liked the atmosphere of the movie . no more kids in springwood  only crazy grown  ups . the nightmare scenes are all great . the soundtrack is awesome  especially the opening song called   i  m awake now   performed by goo goo dolls . in my opinion  the final nightmare is a horror masterpiece and i can  t believe it  s so underrated . maybe it is misunderstood  or i have different tastes  anyway  all freddy fans should watch it . it has a lot of scary moments as well as funny moments too  and a lot of cameos  get yourself ready for something different and you might not be disappointed .  ,1
i have seen already fantastic stories  but the premises of this one are so unbelievable that it comes very close to being ridiculous . a rich and young guy undergoes a heart transplant the day after his marriage  and he is somehow witnessing his own surgery and the plot of his surgeons to kill him . even if there is a medical explanation to such a phenomenon what next happens is a mixture of dialog among . . . say . . . souls  . . . maybe and real life where the dedicated mother will do everything to save the life of her son . there is no shade of suspense or thrill  just a combination of a bad and simplistic plot with a series of coincidences that can never happen in life .  br    br   this is not to say that the film is completely lacking quality  actually first time director joby harold does a decent job in directing a good team of actors that includes hayden christensen at his first major role after having taken off the anakin skywalker costume  fabulous jessica alba and super  gifted lena olin . all would have deserved a better story .  ,0
first thing i noticed in this movie of course  was the unnecessary amount of nudity . it  s not oozing nudity or anything  but a lot that was not needed . annik borel plays a disturbed woman believing her families ghost stories that her ancestor who eerily resembles her was a werewolf  and believes their fate are destined to be the same . which actually i found quite interesting . the original wolf man was intended to be a completely psychological movie  but universal threw in the actual wolf man you were never supposed to see for n extra buck or two . i find this concept of someone not really being a werewolf interesting . unfortunately this is not the film i was searching for .  br    br   instead we know shes not a werewolf from the beginning  so there  s no thrill or twist  also they attempt to make the film seem like a this really happened scenario . they fail there too adding one or two parts of the film referring to this being reality . at first i was excited upon reading the description of the film . but i slowly realized it was a cover just so they could expose the main characters breasts as often as possible .  br    br   annik borel is either a decent actor playing a great psychotic role  or a really bad actor playing a psychotic role . since the character danniele has no brains and is just a nut who runs around insane and snarling and snapping like a wolf  it takes little skill to play . she has moments were her performance breaks through for a creepy moment but is quickly ruined by the poor camera work and light . the idea is great  but hideously executed throughout the film .      ,0
stefan is an x  con that five years ago got married to marie . their marriage has been stable until stefan past catch up with them and he  s offered to do a courier job . stefan  s job is a heroin delivery from germany to sweden which should go easily .  br    br   in germany stefan meet elli  a girl from bosnia that has been sold to a stripclub owner . stefan dislikes what he sees and decide to help elli out of her misery . due to the fact that elli  s father during the war fleed to sweden elli now goes with stefan to sweden . to make up with the past stefan promises elli to help her find her father  no matter what it takes . finally back in sweden the whole situation seems to be more complicated than stefan ever thought of . .  br    br   this movie doesn  t seem to fit in the ordinary class of swedish movies due to the fact that it  s been americanized alot . regina lund and cecilia bergqvist makes it all average  the effects makes the movie a little too much though . see it and jugde for yourself .  br    br    ,0
well worth watching  especially with the nice twist of a journalist with integrity  you are expecting a big fall down story line as grey owl is unmasked as a fraud  but it is not to be and adds to the generally optimistic and uplifting theme and drama of the story and film .  br    br   this has to be brosnan  s best performance to date  he convinces admirably as the english boy playing indians . the stand out scene is the return to his  aunts  where brosnan and the two elderly lady actresses make a wonderful scene full of feeling of nostalgia and a life lost with so little dialogue  just with expressions and good direction . perfect .  br    br   the story is so little known and the message so universal and all important it is a real pity this film did not get better recognition  maybe in time it may become a bit of a classic and a sleeper . i hope so .  br    br   well done dickie attenborough and cast .  ,1
if anybody really wants to understand hitler  read wwi history not wwii history . find out what happened during that war  how soldiers had to live around dead corpses all the time . how so many soldiers went insane  from what they saw during wwi  at the time they called it  shellshocked  now the call it post  traumatic stress disorder . if you learn the true horrors of wwi  you will begin to understand hitler . you will understand how a human being can become desensitized to death  not because their evil but simply because it was the only way for them too cope with the horrors around them .  br    br   this movie unfortunately misses that  as so many others do . read some books on the subject and you should watch the movie  paths of glory   the only good wwi movie ever made . you will see the frustration of the soldiers in that movie  the sense of helplessness  and a utter devaluation of human life  as nothing more than bullet catchers .  br    br   thats what this movie misses  its really the key point to understanding germany . a lost war  where millions and millions of germans lost their lives  for no real reason . then comes an utter economic collapse  following the war . those are the factors that create extremism .  br    br   the loss of family members and massive poverty will create always lead to extremism . unfortunately this movie ignored these factors  and has just become another throw away piece of crap to throw on the pile . with really no real value  there are fictional movie  s based upon fictional characters that could give you a better idea of hitler than this does . they just threw hitlers name on this so it would sell more .  ,0
paul greengrass definitely saved the best bourne for last  i  ve heard a lot of people complain about they way he filmed this movie  and some have even compared the camera style to the blair witch project . all i have to say to that is . . . are you kidding me  come on it was not that bad at all . i think it helps the action scenes to feel more realistic  which i would prefer over highly stylized stunt choreography . as for the rest of the movie i really didn  t even notice it .  br    br   you can tell that damon has really gotten comfortable with the role of jason bourne . sometimes that can be a bad thing  but in this case its a really good thing . he really becomes jason bourne in this installment . damon also has a great supporting cast in joan allen  ezra kramer  and julia stiles . david strathairn was a great addition to the cast  as he added more depth to the secret cia organization .  br    br   even though the movie is filled with great car chases and nonstop action  they managed to stick a fair amount of character development in their with all of that going on . this film stands far above the other two bourne movies  and is definitely one of the best movies of the     summer season   ,1
thsi is one great movie . probably the best movie i have ever seen . i watch it over and over again . i must give it      stars because like i said this is probably the best movie i have ever seen . this movie popcorncoke best mix you can imagine . if you want to watch some movie then i clearly recommend this one . first i sawed it i liked it so i buy  ed it and now i own it and watch it probably every day . my sons like it and think that this is the best movie ever seen . this movie is about guy in fantasy world . i don  t want to spoil all the movie so you can enjoy it after you read my text . lovely movie lovely characters  lovely story  and just great stuff . a must watch movie . hope you enjoyed my comment cya  br    br   jim make  ,1
i don  t think i  ll ever understand the hate for renny harlin .  die hard   was cool  and he gave the world  cliffhanger   one of the most awesome action movies ever . that  s right  you little punks   cliffhanger  rules  and we all know it .  br    br   sly plays gabe walker  a former rescue climber who is  just visiting  his old town when he is asked to help a former friend  hal tucker  michael rooker   assist in a rescue on a mountain peak . walker obviously came back at a convenient time  because the stranded people are actually a sophisticated team of thieves led by eric qualen  john lithgow  . qualen  co . have lost a whole lot of money they stole from the u . s . government somewhere in the rocky mountains and they really would like it back . . .  br    br   essentially   cliffhanger  is another  die hard  clone . just trade in the confines of nakatomi plaza to the open mountain ranges of the rocky mountains  complete with scenes created to point out the weaknesses of our hero and keep him mortal . naturally  that set up is totally ripped to shreds soon enough  as stallone  s character avoids quite a large number of bullets with ease  and slams face  first into several rock faces with no apparent side  effects . after all  isn  t that what action movies are all about   br    br    cliffhanger  is one of the most exciting action movies around . a showcase of great scenes and stunts . one of the early stunts is one of the best stunts i  ve ever seen in a movie  and while the rest of the movie does not get any better than it did at the beginning  it maintains its action awesomeness . john lithgow  s lead villain is entertaining  and one bad dude . quite possibly one of the coolest lead villains ever .  br    br    cliffhanger  is easily one of stallone  s best efforts  definitely renny harlin  s best effort  and a very exciting action movie       ,1
just looking at the sets  staging and editing it is easy to tell this project lacked a proper budget . maybe bela lugosi is meant to take your mind off of things like that . young brides drop dead at the altar after saying  i do  . their corpses are stolen by a renowned horticulturist dr . lorenz  lugosi  and a couple of his freakish minions as his aging wife  elizabeth russell  needs injections of the glandular fluids of the young virgins to remain forever young . . . forever beautiful . an eager local cub reporter  luana walters  realizes that each missing bride wore the same rare orchid to the altar an orchid in which dr . lorenz would be most knowledgeable . a typical horror movie storm brews making a visit to the lorenz estate a bit spooky especially with a dwarf and a slobbering hunchback on the premises . other players angelo rossitto  tristram coffin  minerva urecal and frank moran .  ,0
many things become clear when watching this film   the acting is terrible . tom hanks and wendy crewson are so  so  but the parent  child conflict borders soap opera  ish . the other two boys an overly pouty child prodigy and your stereotypical i  m  a  babe  but  i  m  really  sensitive  inside blonde dreamboat   the film as a whole is depressing and disappointing   robbie  s dreams and episodes are disturbing  acted by tom hanks     the inclusion of the beginning love ballads is an odd choice   we are all special friends      the weird lines and side plots are not made any better by the terrible acting and   this is a really bad movie . expect to be disappointed   and probably disturbed .  ,0
 . . . this verson doesn  t mangle the bard that badly . it  s still a horrible minimalist production  hamlet  s dutch uncle is inexplicably dubbed by a spaniard  whether it  s ricardo montalban or not is subject to debate   and maximilian schell overacts like never before . most of the dialogue makes it through unscathed  and the fact that the mst  k version feels obliged to point out repeatedly that the speeches are long duh doesn  t strike me as incredibly humorous . mostly it  s just bad acting  though .  ,0
just saw this at the     vancouver international film festival and it was funny as hell and a bit surreal . takes place in toronto  where these two losers live in this run  down house in the middle of a freeway system . david hewlett  pin  cube  cypher  and andrew miller  cube  are just great as the two losers who wish the world would just go away . the acting  dialogue and writing are very good  and the whole film looks great for such a low  budget flick . director  writer vincenzo natali was in attendance at this screening  and he seemed so intelligent and down  to  earth . this guy is so inventive with these great stories that work so well within small budgets  it puts big budget hollywood crap to shame   ,1
this is a typical  perfect crime  thriller . a perfect crime is executed and the investigating police officer  ignoring all the clues  immediately knows who guilty is . the audience has to wait around the whole movie for the guilty to be caught . the result is like every single episode of  columbo  or  murder she wrote  . the director himself refers to the hackney story by showing the police officer watching an episode of matlock  this story barely fills up   minutes but the director insists on using all    minutes filling with every cliche in the book . skip this one  you are not missing anything .  ,0
i have to say the worst part of the movie was the first half hour . i was really confused about who was who . for example  bill paxson  s character had long hair and was wearing a jacket . then  when all the males arrived at camp  it turned out there was a character who looked like bill paxson  but wasn  t . i said where  s bill paxson  then  there was a guy with his girlfriend . he said she was   . this was supposed to be a    year reunion of the camp director  s  alan arkin  most memorable . later on  this same girl was interacting and talking about her camp experiences . that made no sense . she would have been one years old . that said  the movie turned out to be pretty good . kevin pollak was the nice guy who was always being teased . one guy was a complete narcissist  and ended up losing his beautiful girlfriend . alan arkin was interesting as an old  style camp director  who admits that he has grown out of touch with modern youth . the best part was that none of the grown  up campers were successes in life . none of them had very great careers . this seemed very real life . the movie was compared to the big chill . in some ways it wasn  t as exciting as the big chill  but it was a lot more realistic . so  even though the beginning is not promising  the movie ended up turning into a pretty good one .  ,1
this a casper the friendly ghost short from my childhood  and i re  watch it on youtube  thank god  for you tube   after that i love this short  and it is one of my favorite casper shorts .  br    br   i love how the short starts off spooky with frank gallop  s haunting narration until we get to see casper sitting by his tombstone in the cemetery  reading . while every ghost rose from the graves to  boo  people  casper decides to leave in search for a friend . but in trying to make a friend  anyone who sees casper runs away . poor casper sat on a log and weep until a little fox cub comes up an nuzzles him . casper and the little fox quickly bond and he quickly names the cub ferdie and considers him to be his very best friend .  br    br   casper and ferdie  s relationship is put in tremendous jeopardy however when casper is not keeping a close eye on ferdie while they are playing a game of hide and seek . while ferdie is hiding a hunter and two of his hunting dogs come and try to kill little ferdie and ferdie is running as fast as possible until he is out of breath and starts panting . while the hunter is firing gunshots towards ferdie casper notices they are trying to kill him and flies in the hunter  s direction and pleads that the hunter leaves ferdie alone . and the hunter and dogs are terrified of casper . casper yells to ferdie that the hunter and the dogs are gone and that everything is fine . but casper sees ferdie  s body is not moving and asks if he is ok . when casper sees ferdie has died he starts mourning in pain because he lost  the only friend he ever had in his whole life .  casper returns back to the cemetery where he has buried ferdie and has made a gravestone for him next to casper  s gravestone . casper continues mourning in pain until he sees that ferdie has resurrected as a ghost himself . ferdie starts licking casper on his cheek . casper screams for joy because he has been reunited with ferdie .  br    br   overall  it is a really good short though surprisingly disturbing  showing death in a family  oriented cartoon .  ,1
but it is kinda hilarious  at least if you grew up on weird al  like i did . it  s a mockumentary about his life and career  beginning with superstardom and going back to trace the origins . it  s uneven in places  but some of the segments are still very funny  particularly when he goes to japan . although it  s not quite as emotionally textured as lost in translation  and he doesn  t find love however fleeting  he does capture in a bottle the absolutely bizarre cultural melange that is tokyo street life .  br    br   perhaps weird al isn  t recognized as the insightful cultural commentator that he is perhaps a rose by any other name would smell just as sweet . still  this is a funny movie .  ,1
i stumbled across rerun syndication of this show several years ago  and fell in love with it . it features ta leoni and holland taylor and kept me laughing  one episode after the next . i guess it didn  t make it so big  and was cancelled after a few seasons  but i believe it was a good run  and would suggest watching it . . . if the opportunity arises .  ,1
i watched this film for   minutes and counted  mullets . that  s a mullet every  minutes . seriously though  this film is living proof that formula works . if it ain  t broke  it don  t need fixin . a streetwise  yet  vulnerable heroine  a hardened ex  cop martial arts master with a heart of gold and a serial killer with  issues  . pure magic .  ,0
this rip off of the     hit  gremlins  is quite possibly the biggest train wreck of a movie ever made . even for a  b  grade movie  all other cheap horror movies on the same platform completely dwarf this movie in terms of plot  acting  and goodness .  br    br   it begins with a random old security guard and the younger punky security guard whose name is of no importance . why  because a few minutes into the film he walks into the  forbidden  safe  and is killed whilst living out his fantasy of being a rock star in a cheap pub .  br    br   this is just an appetizer for the scat  filled main course . the main character  kevin  struggles various times to prove himself as more than a total pussy . perhaps he succeeds within the film  but to the audience he proves himself as nothing more than a bad actor . kevin gets himself a job with the old security guard  and is guided through his security shift in the  wait for it  abandoned studio lot . yes why bother making a set when you can just use the studio itself . back to the film . kevin somehow opens the forbidden safe and releases the hobgoblins . the hobgoblins force people to live out their wildest fantasies and then kill them for some reason . they must be returned before sunrise or else . . . or else what  exactly .  br    br   other characters include kevin  s  macho  army friend nick  nick  s  woman  daphne whose character has no more substance than a bitch  slut attitude and prostitute worthy outfits . there is kevin  s manipulative and  reserved  girlfriend amy  whose deepest desire is apparently to be a badly portrayed cher look  alike with fishnet stockings with a pair of blue grandma underpants on top . . don  t ask me how that works . quite possibly the most entertaining character of all is kyle . how such groups of friends are made is up for question . kyle is a perverted creep who can  t go an hour without self  stimulating . his hobbies include calling up sex  chat lines from other people  s houses and most likely sniffing underwear .  br    br   the story unfolds as the heroes search for the hobgoblins knee  high creatures  aka . hand puppets  which  for some reason  attempt to travel no further than the borders of the local neighborhood . each of the characters eventually lives out their wildest fantasy which never has anything to do with having millions of dollars . . . or the film having a big budget .  br    br   warning spoilers ahead the twist at the end of this movie will leave the watcher wondering  what   . the hobgoblins are returned to the safe by . . . their own free will . perhaps they lost patience waiting for sunrise to wreak havoc  or perhaps the story  writers got writer  s cramp and decided not to worry about the ending . upon returning to the safe  the old security guard reveals  what he learned in the military  and detonates explosives which destroys the safe  signaling the end of the evil hobgoblins and the end of this roller coaster ride better fitted to a ride on an escalator .  br    br   the sheer badness of this film is enough to send someone to tears . if you plan to watch it  i recommend a few alcoholic drinks beforehand to take any serious consideration of the film out of mind .  ,0
i am a huge adam sandler fan  and one day i was looking at the castcrew selection on one of his dvd  s and saw  going overboard  and decided to go out and rent it . so i went out with a few buddies of mine and rented it . we put it on and we were shocked to see an adam sandler that didn  t hit puberty yet  he looks as if he was   when this movie came out . i couldn  t even watch   minutes of this crap  i didn  t laugh  chuckle  or even smirk at this movie  actually the only time i smirked was when i saw how horrid this movie was . i could not believe how hard he tried to make the viewers laugh in this movie . . . and it didn  t work once . although from seeing the horribly awful camera angles and hearing the disgusting script i realized why i had never heard of this movie  . . . because it sucks more than anything has ever sucked before . this movie  in my opinion  was the worst movie ever made  . . . . ever   ,0
this is without a doubt one of the best movies i have ever seen . the first time i saw it i was about  or   years old . i began looking sometime before the rape scene . and when i saw it i was really shocked thinking  what kinda sick movie is this   . today i  ve seen it from the beginning and really understood how great this movie really is . it  s exciting  frightening  shocking and in it  s own unique way disturbing . but the best thing about it is the ending where the audience is shown that this experience will haunt the characters for the rest of their lifes . it  ll torture their conscience and they will worry for the rest of their lifes about the bodies being found in that river . and there is nothing they can do about it  it  s something they have to live with . this ending is one of the most unhappy endings in movie history and very smart  brilliant and horrifying  br    br   and the acting is also great  especially jon voight and burt reynolds . magnificent acting in this movie . all in all  john boorman has created one of the best movies throughout movie history based on dick chaney  s novel . a must see for all the movie lovers  ,1
debbie reynolds toe  taps  tangos and  yes  tap  dances her way through this ordinary thriller which has a distinctly fabricated    s atmosphere . two ladies  brought together when their sons commit a murder  try starting their lives over by running a tap  dance school for tots in hollywood . trouble is  one of them is plagued by neuroses . can you imagine this thing   years earlier with robert aldrich directing bette davis and joan crawford . . .  nahh  bette never would have allowed joan so much screen  time to strut her stuff  and i can  t imagine bette davis in the other role  tap  dancing her heart out . this is a purely bogus piece of macabre  written by a slumming henry farrell  whose idea of a good  shock  is to stage the mass  murder of a group of rabbits   . not an ounce of honest fun in the whole tepid package .     from   ,0
for die  hard judy garland fans only . there are two    numbers that are really good   one where she does a number with an older cleaning lady  you  ve all seen the pics   and a pretty good number at the very end . there are a couple of scenes where the lines are funny . but  basically  the script is so bad and the movie so dated that it  s hard not to cringe at the awfulness throughout . but it  s worth the  .   to rent the movie   just be prepared to fast  forward it .  ,0
though structured totally different from the book by tim krabb who wrote the original  the vanishing   spoorloos  it does have the same overall feel  except for that koolhoven  s style is less business  like and more lyric . the beginning is great  the middle is fine  but the sting is in the end . a surprise emotional ending . as you could read in several magazines there is some sex in the film  but it is done all very beautifully . never explicit  but with lots of warmth and sometimes even humour . it is a shame american films can  t be as open an honoust as this one . where dutch films tend to go just over the edge when it comes to this subject   de grot  stays always within the boundaries of good taste .  de grot  tells an amazing story stretched over more than   years . when you  ll leave the cinema you  ll be moved . what can we ask more of a film  anyway  this film even gives more . . . .  ,1
robert duvall is a direct descendent of confederate general robert e . lee  according the imdb . com movie database . after seeing this film  you may think duvall  s appearance is reincarnation at it  s best . one of my most favorite films . i wish the composer  peter rodgers melnick had a cd or there was a soundtrack available . wonderful scenery and music and  all too  true  to  life   especially for those of us that live in  or have moved to  the south . this is a  real moment in time .  life moves on  slowly  but  strangers we do not remain .   ,1
this is a story about shin  ae  who moves to milyang from seoul with her young son jun to start over after the accidental death of her husband . her husband was born here  and she is opening up a piano school  but also has ambitions to own some land with the insurance money she received from the death . if that is what the film was about  it probably would have been like a hollywood film  with her falling for some local guy and being happy with her son in their new home . but  this is not hollywood . her son gets kidnapped and murdered  ostensibly because it is known she has cash from the settlement . the grief process  attempts at moving on  attempts to clear her conscience of guilt  are all done admirably  and the lead actress is superb . the only caveat  and it has to be stated  is that this is a depressing film . you have to know that going in . you want shin  ae to go through her grief and find some measure of happiness . again  this is not hollywood  it is korea and in korean cinema  especially drama  they pull no punches . life is what happens to you . great acting  but sometimes a tough film to watch  due to the goings on . if you stay  you  ll be rewarded . do that .  ,1
in this movie  the old amitabh bachchan falls in love with a much younger woman  again . he meets her in his restaurant . the younger woman  tabu  flirts with him . he does not know what to do and asks her out . her reaction on his invitation is rather weird . is was supposed to be funny .  br    br   and that annoys me about this whole movie . it wasn  t that funny . the jokes and script was terrible  the only jokes i liked was about the teeth of a waiter  but after a several times  even that began to bore .  br    br   amitabh has a little girlfriend called sexy . this was a weird relationship  a little girl with the mind of an old woman  it was frightening  i know someone can be attached to a kid  but this man has adult conversations with this child . it did not make any sense .  br    br   tabu  s father is paresh rawal . he has to give amitabh a hard time  but we all know paresh  he can  t do that . so even the conversation at the end  when they sit all around the table  even that was supposed to be funny .  br    br   i only like movies who really are funny . i suppose i will never watch this movie again .  ,0
men of honor stars cuba gooding jr .  as real life navy diver carl brashear who defied a man  s navy to become the first african american navy diver . sometimes by his side and sometimes his adversary there was one man who carl brashear really admired . his name was master chief billy sunday  robert deniro  . sunday in a lot of ways pushed  aggravated and helped carl become the man he wanted to be .  br    br   i loved cuba in this film . his portrayal here is as liberating and as powerful as denzel washington was in the hurricane . through every scene we can see his passion  motivation and stubbornness to achieve his dream . we can see the struggle within in him as he embarks to make his father proud . i also loved how the director created and brought forth a lot of tension in some of the key diving scenes . brashear  s encounter with a submarine during a salvage mission is heart  stopping and brilliant .  br    br   the only fault i could see would have to lie in the supporting cast . cuba and deniro  s characters are very intricate and exciting to watch . which does make you a little sad when they have to butt heads with such two  dimensional supporting characters . the evil lt . cmdr . hanks  sunday  s wife  charlize theron   the eccentric diving school colonel  hal holbrook  and cuba  s love interest are the characters i found to not have very much depth . what could have made these characters more substantial and more effective was a little more time to develop them . why was that colonel always in his tower  how come sunday  s wife was so bitter and always drunk   br    br   another curious question has to be this . what happened to carl brashear  s wedding  i mean if this film is chronicling this man  s life wouldn  t his wedding be an important event  maybe it  s just me . men of honor  however  is a perfect example of the triumph and faith that the human spirit envelops . this film will inspire and make you feel for this man  s struggle . which i do believe was the reason this powerful story was told . my hat goes off to you carl brashear . i really admire your strength .  br    br    ,1
very bad acting  and a very shallow story . not even a decent b  movie  br    br   events that were suposed to be shocking like humans geting on board an alien ship were boring and very lame .  br    br   this is one of the worst sci  fi i  ve ever seen . i saw the  .  stars and decided to watch it since i like the genre  but it sucked so bad .  br    br   now there  s really very few good movies on alien subject  i think because most of them are low budget  br    br   i give it      ,0
of all the reviews i  ve read  most people have been exceedingly hard on alexandre . neither marie or veronika ever seemed that they would particularly desperate to keep alexandre  he being only slightly intelligent though not at all intellectual  as most of us are  however hard it may be for anyone to admit . alexandre is getting away with life perfectly  being totally taken care of  getting and giving what he wants . the girls are allowing this  veronika loves sex  marie is his patron . is there anything wrong with any of this  is anyone in love  really  i don  t think so . though french new wave cinema is prone to pretension and so on  it is marvelous simply because of its lack of a need for a plot in order to create emotion . ease is perfectly lovely and all anyone in alexandre  s position  in an urban area can ask for . i  m looking for a patron  anyone interested   ,1
there have been a lot of zorro films made over the decades  but it  s a shame that one of the best is probably one of the least seen .  br    br   zorro  s fighting legion is a bit different from other zorro films . first off  it  s a republic serial in   chapters . and this time  zorro is not played by a top studio star like douglas fairbanks  tyrone power or antonio banderas but instead by workman  like actor reed hadley . while hadley does not cast as strong a presence over the proceedings as those other  he does an adequate job  helped by the fact that he is not the sole hero here as the title implies  he has a fighting legion to call upon .  br    br   another big difference is that the setting isn  t california . the story here take place in central mexico in     where a man posing as a living god incites the indigenous indian population and a band of outlaws to aid him in his plan to overthrow the newly established mexican republic . something  zorro  and a handful of followers plan to do anything they can to stop .  br    br   don  t get me wrong  there is at least one incredibly cheesy moment per episode  from corny  twang  bow sound effects to ludicrous acting . but overall  this represents one of the best republic serials of all time  and probably the best zorro one .  br    br   the plot is stronger than most serials and never becomes incomprehensible or meandering .  and there  s lots of great action  fans of the indiana jones movies will notice many bits borrowed from this serial .  ,1

back in     i saw  true   tom tykwer  s contribution to paris je t  aime . when i saw it i loved it and became thrilled . it became my favorite short film and made me appreciate the format so much . of course i wanted to watch the whole film  and i would even check who was attached  etc .  br    br   yesterday i finally saw it  courtesy of the internet .  br    br   first of all i must say that it looks awesome . the photography is beautiful in every short and shot  at the worst being nothing special  but still brilliant and clear . later i read the trivia here  and maybe it  s how scanning in  k gives more justice to all the dp  s work . my special favorites are the  quais de seine  first scene  that sunlight    the sin city  esquire  but better for me   quartier de la madeleine   and    th arrondisement   but you know  what the hell i like them all  true  or  faubourg saint  denis  still makes me nervous with those brilliant colours  my eyes  they tremble   and  quartier latin  is gold imprisoned on silver . beautiful .  br    br   yes  these are some beautiful short films .  br    br   now let  s get onto the content . i very much  and i mean very much  like the eclecticism that is so successfully felt . you never have have the same themes or treatment between two shorts  and i think the formula is restrictive enough to let all these artists explore beautiful and deepening things inside the shorts . i loved coming from a simple love story into a crazy  chinese  musical  in  paris  with  barbet  schroeder into a social commentary into a terror comedy into a humble monologue . i love surprises  and this film has them  it  s great they took a chance to let all these director  s flesh out things that are not usual in mainstream cinema  which i have come to heavily despise  . it  s not heavily experimental  but i can breath the breathing space these people had .  br    br   i like the small time and i love the acting . i love the simplicity and i love the love . i like the simple feelings and the beauty and the eclecticism and in general it  s a film that is very very very nice to see  alone or with someone . to simply feel . it left me feeling very good .  br    br   there is something about the earnestness in it . . . it  s so frank . . .  br    br   what i didn  t like  well  for me there are two shorts that aren  t exactly the best   quais de seine   which is good natured  sure  and maybe even necessary  but feels too much like a commercial   and  pre  lachaise  that even though i love the acting  i felt it  s themes were forced . but that of course  is just me .  tour eiffel  i also didn  t love but i think is probably because of my very different sensibility from that of sylvain chomet  i don  t know if this film has a special interest for people who already know the actor  s and directors  and so they can delight in their interaction  in the surprises  look out for alexander payne in a funny role  and basically in  what will this director do with this   great question . i enjoyed it very much in that way .  br    br   i repeat now most shorts i loved and all of them together form a beautiful and energetic mix . i definitely recommend it . definitely    so  watch it if you like eclectic beautiful love   ,1
i saw this movie today and i have to say  it was much much better than i expected it to be about couple of hours before going to see it . personally i had some prejudice due to the language of it  but it did totally change my idea . the movie was in most cases surprisingly good with the great actor and actress performances . it was a story about a boy who had a dream and who did everything to reach it . this really touched me and as a film  which is based on a true story  it convinced me . a new school  psycho headmaster and a young boy who get known with a new teacher  a bit different one than the others and about fighting for the things even if they doesn  t seem to work out . it showed how little things can make huge changes in many things  and how difference can sometimes cause difficult situations . also i think the actor selections has succeeded perfectly . it really felt like you had been some person watching the episodes as an outsider when they happened . before i spoil this movie with praises  i have to admit that there were some things and situations that didn  t look and feel realistic . . like the one where the headmaster of the school beat frits aka . martin in front of the class  at the end of the movie . he really got beaten badly  but the only thing that it caused to him  was some blood coming from the nose when comparing that to the first beating in the beginning  when frits got some stitches . . well i guess every movie has it own faults . . have to say  that if i someday somewhere find this dvd from the store  it  s sure thing  that i take it with me .  ,1
bill  buddy rogers  is sent to new york by his uncle  richard tucker  to experience life before he inherits    million . his uncle has paid  women jacqui  kathryn crawford   maxine  josephine dunn  and pauline  carole lombard  to chaperone him and ensure that he does not fall foul of gold  diggers . one such lady cleo  geneva mitchell  turns up on the scene to the disapprovement of the women . we follow the tale as the girls are offered more money to appear in a show instead of their escorting role that they have agreed to carry out for the  months that bill is in new york  while bill meets with cleo and another woman . at the end  love is in the air for bill and one other . . . . . . . . . . . . .  br    br   the picture quality and sound quality are poor in this film . the story is interspersed with musical numbers but the songs are bad and kathryn crawford has a terrible voice . rogers isn  t that good either . he  s pleasant enough but only really comes to life when playing the drums or trombone . there is a very irritating character who plays a cab driver  roscoe karns  and the film is just dull .  ,0
this is the biggest piece of lamo i  ve ever watched . it is excruciatingly boring i would have rather sat through a seminar on creationism than have watched this if i had known it was going to be as boring as it was . not even the   seconds of the hot chick in the bikini with the big ta tas redeems this of anything lower than a  .  br    br   the reviews of this movie claiming that this movie is  unintentionally funny  are absurd and just plain wrong . not one thing is funny about this movie . they spend the first   or so minutes walking through the woods talking about stuff you wouldn  t understand nor care about and it is just as lame when the people start dying because you don  t even know who the people are because they are so uninteresting . honestly though  i didn  t watch it to the ending  but that should say something about how horrible it is . worst movie ever .  br    br   immediately after ejecting this filth from my dvd player i started scraping it against the cement in front of my house  not wanting other blockbuster customers to have to fall upon the same mistake i had made as to rent this movie . then zach peed his pants . thankyou for your time .  ,0
i  m starting to write this review during a break as i watch the movie . it  s the first time i  ve tried doing that  but i  m having trouble getting through this one without occasional breaks . that  s not because it  s intense but because it  s bad .  br    br   it  s almost painfully tedious and unbelievable  especially when the preternaturally robust dying brother ryan  colm feore  is on screen being tragic and bitchy  self  indulgent and self  pitying . this would have been a much better movie if they  d just left that character out of the story .  br    br   he adds nothing but mawkish  maudlin  very irritating melodrama . maybe somebody decided that if they couldn  t make ryan believable they  d just make him obnoxious . the problem with that is who cares if a spoiled  whining  obnoxious jerk is dying  not me .  br    br   the only thing this character has going for him is the fact that he  s dying  and sorry  but that  s just not enough . dying doesn  t make anybody special . we  re all dying  sooner or later . it doesn  t give anybody the right to expect sympathy while acting like a jerk .  br    br   the other two characters  and the actors playing them  david cubitt as theo and chandra west as sarah   are very much more interesting  and their story  without ryan  s self  pitying interruptions  would have made a much better movie . but it  s not over yet  and it  s time to hit play again . maybe something great happens before the end . . . .  br    br   nope . sorry . this rented turkey goes back tonight   ,0
like tarzan the ape man        only more so . there  s more of everything  more animals  more varied african tribes  and scenes in which the thought must be  if this was good with three or four lions  forty would be better . tarzan wrestles with crocodilesthe the crocodile machine spins in the water like a rolling pin  around and around  jaws flapping . tarzan can kill it with his ubiquitous knife if the blasted saurian would hold still . tarzan kills lions and rhinos and a steadily increasing number of animals . his friends are real chimps  people wearing larger ape costumes  and elephants . in fact  they use indian elephantsfar more friendly and trainable than african oneswith costume ears attached to their heads . the human story another white man  worse than the rest  shows up to join with holt to go after the ivory from the elephant graveyard . tarzan won  t show them the way  so the bad guy shoots an elephant so they can follow it to its deathbed . tarzan intercedes  and the bad guy shoots himbut  of course  he survives and returns to save jane . everybody else dies  holt and the bad guy and every single one of their  boys .  people are expendable  especially africans  and there doesn  t seem to be much distinction between the black fellows who die because they work for the white men travelling through taboo country and those black fellows who kill them . this must be the last tarzan movie before the hays code made jane wear more clothes . there are a number of underwater scenes in which jane swims nude  and though the light is flickering the movement and the glimpses are very appealing . apparently one of weismuller  s friends from the olympic swim team did the nude scenes  and not maureen o  sullivan . she  however  moves through the movie wearing the same sort of loincloth weismuller wears  plus a bikini top   showing a splendid glimpse of thigh and hip . they still don  t need to talk a lot . they sleep together and hang out with cool animals and stay away from cities . no wonder they  re happy .  ,1
the flock is unjustly maligned as a lesser  se  en  ripoff . there  s really no reason to compare the two  except maybe for the similar scenery in the final showdown .  br    br   now that that  s out of the way i  ll go into why the flock is very interesting in some respects . mostly it  s a drama piece rather than a full blown thriller about a very vigilant social worker who monitors sexual offenders . at the very beginning you can clearly see his work has got the better of him . evident in two scenes where first he  s interviewing an offender and slaps him around and second when a woman tries to pick him up and all he can think of are his standard questions from his questionnaire .  br    br   gere is very good as errol babbage  the aforementioned social worker . his way of performing his job is not unlike that of a police officer  he carries a gun and is constantly checking newspapers and supplies law officials with information if some of his  flock  may be responsible for a sexual crime . he  s also a person who  s lost all happiness of living and his only relief seems to come from exacting his own vigilante justice on his flock . twice you see him smile  once when he  s apologizing for treating his partner rudely and the other after he  s beaten up a member of his flock .  br    br   as a suspense flick  the flock isn  t as successful . somewhat confusing and with some irritating plot holes but it does have a number of striking set pieces .  br    br   overall the flock is a solid drama about a man performing a dehumanizing job and in the end he has to work hard to keep from being swallowed by the abyss he  s surrounded himself in . the world we live in is a pretty sick place and the further one can distance himself from the worst the happier that person is . the flock gets that point across nicely .  ,1
this movie was pretty much a waste of an hour and a half of my time . i generally like the cheap horror monster type movies  but this movie was a disappointment . the main flaw being the lack of explaining the creatures . when they entered the house and found the man he could have at lease explained them . he doesn  t really say anything about them other than that they killed his parents  and unless i missed something the didn  t say how he managed to escape either . . . not to mention the fact that it gives no clue or reason why the only survivor stays and essentially feeds the creatures after her own near death experience . it would have seemed that she would have had the opportunity to leave after the  cross incident  .  ,0
  the blob  qualifies as a cult sci  fi film not only because it launched    year old steve mcqueen on a trajectory to superstardom  but also because it exploited the popular themes both of alien invasion and teenage delinquency that were inseparable in the     s . interestingly  nobody in the kay linaker  theodore simonson screenplay ever refers to the amorphous  scarlet  red protoplasm that plummeted to earth in a meteor and menaced everybody in the small town of downingtown pennsylvania on a friday night as  the blob .  steve mcqueen won the role of josh randall  the old west bounty hunter in  wanted dead or alive   after producer dick powell saw this paramount pictures  release . meanwhile mcqueen  s attractive girlfriend aneta corsaut went on to star opposite andy griffith in  the andy griffith show  as sheriff taylor  s school teacher girlfriend helen crump . of course  neither mcqueen nor corsaut were teenagers  but then rarely did actual teenagers play actual teenagers . director irvin s . yeaworth  jr .  made his directorial debut with  the blob .  linaker  simonson  s screenplay synthesized four genres first  the alien invasion second  teenage delinquency third  a murder mystery  and fourth a horror chiller . moreover  while the gelatinous substance assumes various shapes  it remains largely anonymous . in other words  the eponymous jell  o neither talks nor communicates by telepathy . instead  it kills without a qualm and discriminates against nobody . the tone of  the blob  is fairly serious in spite of its somewhat campy nature .  br    br   as the filmmakers point out on the criterion dvd release of  the blob   the movie opens uncharacteristically for a sci  fi horror thriller with our hero and heroine in a remote rural locale making out and kissing . jane  anita corsaut  and steve  steve mcqueen  see a large meteor fall to the earth and drive off to find it . meanwhile  an old man finds the meteor and prods it with a stick . the meteor cracks open and a slimy bunch of goop clings to the stick . when the old timer  olin howland of  the paleface   gets a closer look at it  the goop attaches itself to his hand . the old guy runs screaming from the crater and steve nearly hits him with his jalopy . steve and jane pick the guy up and take him to see dr . hallen in town .  br    br   hallen is poised to leave town for a medical conference when steve and jane bring the old guy to his office . hallen phones his nurse to return since he may need to perform an amputation . of course  hallen has never seen anything like the substance on the man  s forearm . hallen sends steve and jane to find out what happened . our heroes run into another group of teenagers that ridicule steve  s fast driving . steve fools him into a reverse drive race  but the local police chief dave  earl rowe  lets him off the hook . steve and the teenagers visit the site of the meteor crater and find the warm remains of the meteor . after they visit the old man  s house and rescue a dog  the teenagers split for a spooky late night movie while steve and jane return to dr . hallen  s office . during the interim  the blob has entirely absorbed the old geezer  killed hallen  s nurse and attacked the doctor . neither acid thrown on the protoplasm nor hallen  s shotgun have any effect on the blob . steve catches a glimpse of the blob absorbing hallen . when steve and jane go to the police department to report the incident  dave is frankly incredulous  while sergeant bert  john benson  believes that it is a prank . bert has an axe to grind with teenagers because his wife died when one struck her car .  br    br   steve and jane take them to hallen  s office  but they can find neither hide nor hair of anybody  but dave admits that the office has been vandalized . against sgt . bert  s advice  dave turns the teens over to their respective parents . no sooner have steve and jane fooled their folks into believing that they are snugly asleep in bed than they venture out again . they drive into town and spot the old man  s dog that got away from them in front of a supermarket . when they go to retrieve the mutt  steve steps in front of the electric eye door of the grocery store and it opens . they find nobody inside  but they encounter the blob . steve and jane take refuge in a freezer and the blob doesn  t attack them . later  after they escape  steve persuades the teenagers that challenged him in a street race to alert the authorities because he is supposed to be home in bed . police chief dave and the fire department arrive at the supermarket . steve tries to convince dave that the blob is in the store . about that time  the blob kills the theater projectionist and attacks the moviegoers . suddenly  a horde of people exit the theater and dave believes steve . steve and jane wind up at a lunch counter that the blob attacks . the proprietor and our heroes hole up in the cellar and steve discovers that a fire extinguisher with its freezing contents forces the blob to back off .  br    br   the authorities collect every fire extinguisher in town and manage to freeze the blob . the pentagon sends down a team to transport the blob to the north pole . as the remains of the blob drift down to the polar ice pack  the end credit appears with a ghostly giant question mark . producer james b . harris obtained stock military footage of a globe master military transport plane depositing the parachute and its cargo .  br    br    the blob  proved to be a drive  in hit and steve mcqueen  s surge to stardom gave the film added momentum . unless you are a juvenile  this little horror movie isn  t scary at all  but yeaworth and his scenarists create a sufficient amount of paranoia and sympathy for our heroes . they never show the blob actually assimilating its victims and leave this to your imagination  so  the blob  isn  t without a modicum of subtlety .  ,1
   years ago  power rangers was one of the shows that swept the nations  especially that of the youth . when i was a   year  old kid living in the philippines  i would watch this show every friday on abs  cbn  channel  over there  . when the movie came out in      it was all shock and awe to me when i watched it with my dad and  uncles . my grandparents even sent me a  balikbayan  box full of power rangers stuff  including the easy  to  build megazord figure and the stuffed toys of the rangers  . i even played the video games  and loved only one of them   mmpr fighting edition    which was really sad . anyway  it was the show that set a stepping stone on my interest on robot series  especially anime mech series like  gundam   now that i  m    i  d like to think this show is pretty cheesy to me now . to prove this  i took a trip down memory lane by buying a   set dvd collection with  mmpr the movie  and  turbo a power rangers movie  and watched both of them . i was like   ugh . how awful . just another junk in the attic for me .  for all of you people of my generation  this is not a show that you  d want to watch over and over again . i  m not saying to leave it behind for the rest of your life  but occasionally is not a bad thing now  is it  instead of  power rangers   i  d recommend something like  mobile fighter g gundam   highly recommended    ninja senshi tobikage   aka ninja robots   or even the original sentai shows that were the basis of  power rangers .   ,0
this movie . . . i don  t know . why they would take such an indellible character as pippi longstocking and cast the singularly charmless tami erin  i will never know . why they would spend money on art direction and some not  all  that  bad special effects  then not bother to edit it properly  i will never know . why the sets and costumes are sometimes in period  and sometimes bizarrely not  why they commissioned such bad songs  why the script doesn  t make any sense whatsoever  not even on a silly  children  s film level  . . . . what were they thinking   nothing about this movie is quite as it should be . every single part is dubbed  and always poorly   every sound effect is slightly wrong  every edit is in the wrong place  every performance is bad in some way . it does manage to create an appropriate atmosphere  despite all the problems  but it never captures the magic that is astrid lindgren  s creation .  ,0
some amusing humor  some that falls flat  some decent acting  some that is quite atrocious . this movie is simply hit and miss  guaranteed to amuse   year old boys more than any other niche .  br    br   the child actors in the movie are just unfunny . when you are making a family comedy  that does tend to be a problem . beverly d  angelo rises above the material to give a funny  and dare i say it  human performance in the midst of this mediocrity .  ,0
this film  s basic premise is a political cartoon . i suppose for those who know nothing about the realities of the military this is probably a  feel  good  film on gender equality . indeed a recent commentator stated  it lets women know that they can do anything they want to do .  what claptrap  no one  man or woman can do anything they want to do  and unfortunately demi moore  buffing  up for seal hell week in the early   week bud  s program by a few sessions at the local gym and her desire alone to be a seal is simply not going to make it so . there is approximately an    dropout rate in what is arguably the roughest military training program  those are the ones who voluntarily drop out  can  t compete on a physical level  suffer frequent physical injury during the training or can  t handle the psychological harassment . i never got beyond the shallowness of the contrived  purported message of this film . in the real world  demi wouldn  t last the first   hours in this harsh and sustained physical training . wishing alone won  t do it . skip this film as wishful thinking  and better spend your time reading  the warrior elite  by dick couch  crown  new york      for the best description as to what really goes on in this training . ring the bell  demi   br    br    ,0

i have a piece of advice for the people who made this movie too  if you  re gonna make a movie like this be sure you got the f  x to back it up . also don  t get a bunch of z list actors to play in it . another thing  just about all of us have seen jurassic park  so don  t blatantly copy it . all in all this movie sucked  f  x sucked  acting sucked  story unoriginal . let  s talk about the acting for just a second  the carradine guy who  s career peaked in     when he did  revenge of the nerds   which was actually a great comedy  . he  s not exactly z list  he can act . he just should have said no to this s   t bag . he should have did what mark hamill did after  return of the jedi  and go quietly into the night . he made his mark as a  nerd  and that should have been that . i understand he has bills to pay  but that hardly excuses this s   t bag . have i called this movie that yet  o . k . i just wanted to be sure . if i sound a little hostile  i apologize . i just wasted  hrs of my life i could have spent doing something productive like watching paint peel  and i feel cheated . i  ll close on that note . thank you for your time .  ,0
one of the ten best comedies ever  br    br   this seems a comedy so joyous and light that sings . keaton  s comedies are  innerly  harmoniously  intelligently ordered  thought .  br    br   wonderfully amusing  deliberately delightful and inventive  three ages should belong to a draft of a comedies top ten if i were to sketch one . a threefold love story will enchant the viewers i want to bring here this approachkeaton  s comedy is like lang  s destiny upsidedownor  rebours . again a couple traverses the waters of timeand of epochsin the stone age  in rome and in keaton  s timesin a mohammedan country  in renaissance italy and in china . the same device works in the both moviesone  a grim  eerie melodrama   the other  a light  virtuouslypaced comedy . at keaton it  s essentially the same couple and maybe the same is with lang . the babe desired by both buster and beery is nice . i have found three ages well written and smart  without being ostentatiously sophisticated the plot is basically very popeyelikethe babe is a piece of furniture  the only protagonists are the two male rivalskeaton and beery .  br    br   keaton  s movie is simply enormously likable  and perhaps one would be tempted to assert this looks like ambitious funyet it  s not  but it is grand fun  large fun  ample fun . and wallace beery makes a fine nemesis .  ,1
deceptive advertising . . . i saw a commercial for carlitos way rise to power that states  from the producer of scarface and carlito  s way  lets get it straight . . . michael bergman did not produce scarface  in fact he was  editing room assistant  for scarface . not to take away from bergman  s talent . . . but in my opinion he should of had a little more class . i think i can speak for the masses when i say . . . we hate being blatantly lied to . as far as the movie goes  it was poor at best . i did think puff daddy did a good job . although  luis guzman should be ashamed for working on this film . overall this film did not do a good job filling in the blanks for carlito  s way . it  s obvious this project was an attempt to make a quick buck rather a good film .  ,0
i saw this movie in      i was   or    when it was released . the theater was perhaps    full when the movie started . ten minutes into the movie me and the friend who went with me to see the film were the only two people in the theater . the movie was really weird and had no plot or reason to its script and people demanded their money back . we decided to stay for the entire movie . . . . why endure such torture   . . . here  s why . we wanted to be true movie critics . . . to have a standard to base all other movies on it is hard to justify saying you have seen the best movie  a    they always come up with something better . but  it is easy to be able to base all other movies off of the worst movie ever made  and this is it . . . a  at best  . there may be other movies out there that truly qualify as a   but i have yet to see them . i now base all movies i see on a scale based on this worst . . . . i am a true movie critic . . . he he .  ,0
a documentarist  like any filmmaker  must convey a compelling story . will pascoe fails utterly in this effort  cobbling together uninspired snippets of chomsky  s wisdom from a visit to mcmaster university in hamilton . the footage is shot amateurishly and in video . pascoe  s only effort at cohering the fragments into a whole is by periodically throwing a vague title on the screen         activism    truth .   br    br   lame .  br    br   compare this with documentaries like  the corporation  or  the fog of war  which create a narrative drawing material from interviews  stock footage  and filmed footage . in the end each delivers a poignant and insightful message deftly and intelligently .  br    br   the only saving graces of the film are chomsky  s nonchalantly delivered upendings of historical dogma  and the fact that the running time is only   minutes .  br    br   one of the more interesting passages was chomsky  s recounting of his experience with national public radio . he describes the conservative media as more accommodating to dissenting views  while npr  s liberal dogma strait  jackets its interviewees and dramatically limits its permitted messages . yet another media outlet to be skeptical of .  br    br   this documentary is for noam chomsky completists only .  ,0
what another reviewer called lack of character development  i call understatement . the movie didn  t bash one over the head with overexplanation or unnecessary backstory . yes  there were many untold stories that we only got a glimpse of  but this was primarily a one  day snapshot into an event that catalyzed change in all of the characters  lives . henry thomas  s performance was a really lovely study in the power of acting that focuses on reaction rather than action . good rental .  ,1
made in      this foreign film should be seen and enjoyed more often .  br    br   we open on a quiet little french village  scanning the roofs of the sleeping citizens . then we hear something that sounds like a party . upon investigating the uproar  two neighboring men are told the story of two men  supposedly friends  who picked two numbers for the lottery .  br    br   our star of the picture has his number and his friend his . when he asks his friend  would he share half of the dough  should his ticket be the winning number  his friend promptly says no . in fact  h . e . double hockey sticks no  is the way he acts about it .  br    br   so when our man discovers he has the winning ticket and that it has been lost  through no fault of his own  he is frantic . everyone is out for themselves  looking for this ticket  in something like a precursor to  the great race .  even though this is all a flashback  i was in knots the whole time and got so upset over every little thing in this all  for  me show  me  the  money cash  in  the  bank film . watch le million today   ,1
somewhere between the food court and zip  s  the mall in this film  br    br   has an explosives store . this is the only place the title character  br    br   can purchase the bomb he plants in the mall in the dull finale .  br    br   a fictional town has a new mall  built on some land that was  br    br   condemned . cute girl  i didn  t catch her name  gets a job as a  br    br   waitress there . she lost her boyfriend in a fire at the site where the  br    br   mall stands . the villainous mall owner hires the arsonist  br    br   responsible for the fire as a security guard after his first security  br    br   guard ends up dead . rob estes  eons before  silk stalkings   is a  br    br   photog  reporter trying to find a story . he hooks up with cute girl   br    br   and their mutual  funny  friend pauly shore  and try to find out if eric  br    br   is still alive . he is  living in the mall basement    and traveling  br    br   through the air ducts and offing different people who upset his  br    br   former girlfriend  including the arsonist . eventually  he kidnaps her  br    br   and the finale involves the bomb and everyone running from the  br    br   scene before the big kablooey . morgan fairchild is along for the  br    br   ride as the mayor . . . yes  she  s the mayor .  br    br   of course  you probably did not need a plot sketch since the entire  br    br   story is in the title . someone named eric is taking revenge against  br    br   people as a phantom of a mall . this also means there is no  br    br   suspense . we know eric is behind this  but we still have to see  br    br   estes and cute girl go through the motions of a silly investigation .  br    br   watch as fairchild  who we know has been in cahoots with the  br    br   mall owner all along  pull a gun on our heroic duo in the middle of  br    br   a crowded party  yet no one says a word as she leads them to her  br    br   office  and her eventual death . the fictional town is huge  yet nary a  br    br   policeman is ever called  everyone relies on mall security for order .  br    br   eric has been hiding since the mall was built  but i am not sure  br    br   where . he seems to live in a basement area  but you would think  br    br   some construction worker would have found him . he also has  br    br   furnished his love pad quite well  and found a few outlets  since he  br    br   has electricity . it might be nicer than your own apartment   br    br   pauly shore fans  both of you  take note . he tricks a security guard  br    br   out of his booth by mooning the camera . yes  stop scanning  br    br   celebrity skin and playgirl  this is where you get to see a grainy  br    br   black and white shot of pauly  s south shore  although no weezil .  br    br   this is just junk  and proof positive that i am down to renting just  br    br   about anything at the video store to stay in the horror section . this  br    br   film is not eric  s revenge  it is the film maker  s revenge for me  br    br   being dumb enough to watch it . here is my revenge i do not  br    br   recommend it . that  ll show  em   br    br   this is rated  r  for physical violence  some gun violence  gore   br    br   some profanity  some female nudity  brief male nudity  and some  br    br   sexual content .  ,0
cat soup at first seems to be a very random animated film . the best way i  ve been able to explain it is that it  s quite acidic . though it  s not totally random . the story is about nyatta  a young cat boy and his sister nyaako . nyaako is very ill and dies  however  nyatta sees her soul being taken away by death and is able to retrieve half of it . the story is about their quest to bring nyaako fully back to life .  br    br   though a lot of the content in this movie seems completely random  it is not . most of it is symbolism for life  death and rebirth . you can also see references from other tales  such as hansel and gretal . this strangely cute short film has an interesting story  packed with a deeper meaning than what you see on the surface of the screen .  ,1
i saw this movie recently .  hours later  my head still hurt from laughing . the plot was soo awful  the jokes were soo bad  but what i didn  t count on were  br    br    . the  scenes before and after the movie that had pat and jay posing  that caused more than enough laughter   br    br    . the kick through the windshield that decapitated the evil  doer .  br    br   this movie is about   times better than the rush hour series  and my copy even came with a disclamer saying if you didn  t like the movie  send certificate to hbo . while i considered it  the date you had to send it in was january      which also caused wackiness to ensue  .  ,1
i  m one of those people who usually watch programs and keep my feelings about a show private . however  pushing daisies is my exception . i became curious about the program from the commercials that aired which gave glimpses of the premise of the show . i was skeptical about it at first  especially after the finale of six feet under was still in my head . here we go again  i thought . i watched the first  second  third and all the other episodes . wow  first of all  i thought it took the subject of death and presented in a way that was palatable without being morbid . the characters were engaging and i like the thought of ned the main character not being able to literally touch the love of his life  chuck without the consequences of her dying .  br    br   most of the characters have a longing for things they can  t have . besides ned and chuck  olive longs for ned . lily and vivian longs for their niece chuck and emerson is always longing for the monetary rewards from the mysterious deaths they solve . i think the characters are picture perfect and believable . i like how emerson who is black plays off of the rest of the characters since as an african american i like the subtle cultural humor that sometimes comes from him .  br    br   all in all  this visual fairytale is one of the most valuable pieces of entertainment that i  ve seen out of the     season . i think the show has enough romance for the romantics and enough who  done  it for the mystery buffs . i just wish the writers would get back to work  so that the show can continue to evolve .  ,1
i absolutely hate this programme  what kind of people sit and watch this garbage   ok my dad and mum love it lol but i make sure i  m well out of the room before it comes on . its so depressing and dreary but the worst thing about it is the acting i cant stand all detective programmes such as this because the detectives are so wooden and heartless . what happened to detective programmes with real mystery    i mean who wants to know what happened to fictional characters we know nothing about that died over   years ago    i wish the bbc would put more comedy on bbc  cos now with the vicar of dibley finished there is more room for crap like this .  ,0
i was utterly disappointed by this movie . i had read some of the other reviews here and had much higher expectations . i expected a drama with more intense character development . but that never happens in the movie . daniel  day lewis is a good actor  but not as good as some reviewers here would have us believe . i tought he repeated the same set of  or  movements in the movie . i would rate his performance  out of   .  br    br   acting  out of   direction is  out of   . script is the worst  out of   .  br    br   i deleted the movie from my dvr at   mins . into the movie . much better movies out there than this . . .  ,0
i gave this more than a  because i did think there were some moral lessons in this story and it provoked some thought and comment from my wife and i . the acting and the dialogue were mediocre and i must confess i came out feeling like i had been beaten over the head with the god this  god that and christ is our saviour stuff . the movie and the story line did not need it . if  as i am  you are a recovering catholic or christian avoid this one it will make you nauseous . the movie did a good job of demonstrating the thin line between being a good citizen and how someone could become a potential stalker focused on what might have been .  ,0
it  s a refreshing breath of air when a movie actually gives you a story line with a beginning  a middle  and a end  a nice  clever mystery  with an appealing heroine for all ages  who wins us over with her wit and charm . andrew fleming  s film is indeed a modern marvel  a comeback to the good old reliable storytelling that was the norm in hollywood . he puts away the over  reliance on special effects that now passes for entertainment and gives us a terrific film  with a very capable young actress  and a talented supporting cast .  br    br   the film is based on the old books  but it has been given updated enough to put in this century however  the props might be different  the heart still is a good mystery  and there is clever one here  one that ties the traditions of the old and the nuances of contemporary youth . emma roberts is an old fashioned girl  who believes in good behavior and respect for others details that are sorely missing from today  s films . she is still good enough to get boys  attentions but she also knows how present poise and self respect . she earns her medals by working hard and is not afraid to show a little guile when it is needed to achieve her goals .  br    br   while taking a vacation to california  our heroine is drawn into the mystery of a hollywood actress who was the victim of foul play suddenly she is  visited  by her ghost and this sets off a series of events that might solve the mystery or result in something dreadful for herself . what makes the movie quite entertaining is the little details  as she discovers that her customary world is nothing compared to the california scene  and this is well presented  without resorting to unnecessary vulgar language or anything graphic or overtly sexual . eventually  the director has enough control to make it all very palatable to all types of audiences  from the young ones to the adults in the audience . it is a movie that deserves to be seen  appreciated  and enjoyed  a film that is rare and delicate  and it  s not afraid to be classified as fun  five stars  ,1
one doesn  t get to enjoy this gem  the     invisible ray  often . but no can forget it . the story is elegant . karloff  austere and embittered in his carpathian mountain retreat  is janos rukh  genius science who reads ancient beams of light to ascertain events in the great geological pastparticularly the crash of a potent radioactive meteor in africa . joining him is the ever  elegant lugosi  as a rare hero   who studies  astro  chemistry .  frances drake is the lovely  underused young wife frank lawton the romantic temptation and the divine violet kemble cooper is mother rukh  in a performance worthy of maria ospenskya .  br    br   the story moves swiftly in bold episodes  with special effects that are still handsome . it also contains some wonderful lines . one rukh restores his mother  s sight  he asks   mother  can you see  can you see    yes  i can seemore clearly than ever . and what i see frightens me .  even better when mother rukh says   he broke the first law of science .  i am not alone among my acquaintance in having puzzled for many many years exactly what this first law of science is .  br    br   this movie is definitely desert island material .  ,1
alfred hitchcok is not my favorite director by any means but imagine what he could have done with this  the plot holds much potential for suspense . john garfield is as almost always excellent and raymond massey is scarily cast against type . nancy coleman is not a very impressive leading lady but the supporting cast is large and very capable .  br    br   yes it starts to sag fairly early . there are too many coincidences . and an important subject is trivialized by its being made into little more  in the end  than a love story .  br    br   it  s fun to watch for garfield  massey  and the character performers . but it  s not awfully good .  ,0
guinea pig the devil  s experiment is without a doubt  stars on first view  its a raw realistic creepy and disturbing look into the dark side of human nature . this movie gets right to the point  you may be thinking what point  the point is to satisfy fan  s of just extreme violence and gore . this movie has some gore  more or less just torturing a women violently . there are really only  scene  s that could be considered gore . i  ll tell you one thing though guinea pig the devil  s experiment makes hostile look like sesame street . if you thought hostile was a crazy brutal disturbing torture flick then you ain  t seen the half of it until you  ve seen guinea pig the devil  s experiment .  br    br   movie rating     gore      br    br   guinea pig the devil  s experiment  uncut       ,1
carry on matron was released in     and it  s becoming clear that the series has reached a natural end with the best entries like cleo  up the kyber and screaming being from the mid to late   s  br    br   in itself matron is by no means bad it  s just that we  ve seen it all before with a thin plot  a bunch of spivs trying to break into a hospital to steal a supply of contraceptive pills which they plan to sell to third world countries  surrounded by gags of a slightly amusing though unsophisticated nature . i think that  s where the problem lies  the gags aren  t all that amusing with the unsophisticated nature starting to show its age . did we need another movie that uses a man dressed up as a woman in order to drive the plot  perhaps the worst criticism i can make is that i saw carry on matron this afternoon  less that twelve hours ago and i have a problem in trying to remember a very funny line . that  s a serious problem for a comedy  ,0
the more i think about it  there was nothing redeeming about this  br    br   movie . i saw it  months ago  so my memory might have made it  br    br   worse than it was  but i do know it was at least as bad as a  out of  br    br     .  br    br   after seeing the movie  i met the director . he seemed so clueless  br    br   as to what he was doing or what he had done  and as far as i  br    br   could tell  he didn  t care for the film either . even he agreed that he  br    br   didn  t really know what he was doing  and he was forced to do  br    br   certain things because it was filmed digitally .  br    br   i felt that the movie was trying to hard to fit in to the formula that it  br    br   built for itself   people all have to be connected in some way . how  br    br   can we get from point  a  to point  b   so in order get from the  br    br   prostitute we see in the start and back to her at the end they    br    br   minutes on each character  s relationship to another person . it  br    br   makes one feel choked by the  demensional  badly drawn  br    br   characters .  br    br   i just remembered the one redeeming part of the movie . . . steve  br    br   bouchemi there is one scene where he is amazing . that  s it . as i  br    br   say . . .  out of   .  ,0
it  s utterly pointless to rate this film . it  s as if you would condemn  or praise  the newly born for his future life . instead look at it as a powerful meditation at what could have been and what has been in the past    years . one hundred and eight years of the cinematograpy what has become of the babe  i like to contemplate on what would have  creatively  happen if europe wasn  t interrupted  devastated  twice by the great wars of the xxth century . on her ruins the bogus neon castle of the non  creative and reactionary circus named hollywood erected itself . before     french  italian and scandinavian cinemas were leading the way both financially and of course creatively . french film in particular was already threading some very original and creative pathways that could have  if not interrupted  possibly altered the medium history in some unimaginable ways . one wonders what the film history would look like today if it wasn  t stultified and choked by the mercantile and cheap political agenda of the hollywood  s    years of  what chekhov might define as the reek of greed and harlotry . . . be it as it might  please at least become aware of la sortie as the key  or at least one of them  to the  kingdom  . thus the birthplace of cinema  lumiere brothers factory  lyon  france the date march   th      there  s also a replica reel shoot in the summer of     so if you notice summer lights and the workers  lighter clothing that was the version shown to the very first people who ever saw the moving images . louis lumiere creative ideas  cinematography  direction it was all louis  own domain because auguste took care of the rest  money  . first film reels were all fifty seconds long the camera  le cinematograph   the cameramen  le cinematographer  having only paltry fifty seconds to make things happen  apparently le institute lumiere has managed to preserve around     of these first films executed mostly by an industrious brigade of loumiere travelling cinematographers criss  crossing the globe . so  all the stars in starry heavens and a minute of silence for perhaps the most magical invention in human history  so far  .  ,1
horrible acting  horrible cast and cheap props . would  ve been a lot better if was set as an action parody style movie . what a waste . starting from the name of the movie .  br    br    the enemy  naming it  action movie  would  ve made it better .  contributing to the parody effect  . the cop looking like a   year old player  the blond girl just having the same blank boring look on her face at all times . towards the end of the movie him and her are working together to take down the bad guys and every time they exchange words it just feels like the cheap lines given before a sex scene in a porn movie . horrible . don  t waste your time .  ,0
i wouldn  t be so quick to look at all the good reviews and say this might be a good show . . this show is only good if you don  t know what  talent  is . . i won  t even say how offensive it is  i know it can be offensive to a lot of people  because thats not really what bothers me about the show . . what bothers me is that people watch this and think it  s funny . . it makes me feel like our generation is getting to stupid and i  m actually scared that it will one day be run by people who watch this garbage . .  br    br   basically the plot is simple . . it  s about an offensive  self centered  spoiled women  sarah silvermen  getting through everyday life . .  br    br   thats it . . like that hasn  t been done a million times . . in fact almost every joke either has been done or is racist . .  br    br   sarah also likes to sing . . i like her voice . . thats it . . not the lyrics . . the lyrics are dreadful . . which she likes to sing about a lot of things . .  br    br   if you like to see a hot women put everyone else down and make them feel like crap while at the same time farting and saying crap about every race then this show is for you . .  ,0
i thought that this movies was a letdown i expected it to be so much better than it was . i am so glad i didn  t pay to see this movie and that i didn  t sit in a movie theater for this one . where to begin on this movie  the acting in this movie was average  the humor was terrible and just the overall storyline of this movie wasn  t special . i thought that this movie was suppose to be great  but it wasn  t more than a cheesy waste of time . i think that the acting in this movie was terrible no of the actors in this movie had chemistry  it just wasn  t there . i think that if maybe we had a different actor play kirk than jay baruchel it might have been better but the entire time i watched this movie he looked high and i didn  t get the feeling that he wasn  t acting in this movie . now  alice eve did a great job as an actress but  there was no chemistry between her and jay . all the actors in this movie were no names and had very little affect in this movie . the humor in this movie was not funny at all  there were a few one liners in this movie that were ok but nothing worth saying to your friends that they would understand . i think that jim field smith had a hard time with this because he couldn  t decide if he wanted a romance or a comedy . i honestly think he needs to stick with the burger king commercials . i think that this movie could have been better if the writers would have gone to a different director . the storyline of this movie is just like every other hot girl just ok guy love storyboring i think that it would have been better if it had more originality  but what a letdown nothing . i honesty would not recommend anyone go see this movie . i think that you would have more entertainment at the dentist than at this movie . so save yourself the agony and just don  t see it .  ,0
this movie made me very angry . i wanted desperately to throttle the  scientists  and unseen film  makers during the course of it . very  very painful to sit through . sophomoric and pretentious in the worst way . the little good information on brain function  chemistry and quantum theory is lost in a sea of new agey horse sht . the worst offenders were the crack  pot charlatans ramtha and joseph dispenza . mr . dispenza informs us that most people lead lives of mediocrity and clearly implies that he  on the other hand  is living on a higher plane . even the ideas and attitudes that i basically agree with are presented in such a heavy handed  clumsy  superior  pretentious  preachy manner that i felt the desire to disavow them . i think that  s what made me so angry  the fact that they  ve taken what are indeed profound aspects of established scientific thought and marred them with their new age hokum . much of it is based around the fallacy of applying concepts of quantum theory to the macro world . fittingly  the dramatized portions with marlee matlin are amateurish and clich ridden .  br    br   i would refer people instead to bill bryson  s excellent survey of science  a brief history of nearly everything .  there  s plenty of profound wonder about life and the universe in the actual  established science .  ,0
michelle rodriguez is the defining actress who could be the charging force for other actresses to look out for . she has the audacity to place herself in a rarely seen tough  girl role very early in her career  and pull it off   which is a feat that should be recognized . although her later films pigeonhole her to that same role  this film was made for her ruggedness .  br    br   her character is a romanticized student  fighter  lover  struggling to overcome her disenchanted existence in the projects  which is a little overdone in film . . . but not by a girl . that aspect of this film isn  t very original  but the story goes in depth when the heated relationships that this girl has to deal with come to a boil and her primal rage takes over .  br    br   i haven  t seen an actress take such an aggressive stance in movie  making yet  and i  m glad that she  s getting that original twist out there in hollywood . this film got a  from me because of the average story of ghetto youth  but it has such a great actress portraying a rarely  seen role in a minimal budget movie . great work .  ,1
wow . this was probably the worst dcom ever . i watched the first half hour and i laughed . brenda song plays wendy  the popular girl with the hot jock boyfriend and stuck up friends who is determined to be homecoming queen . she is supposed to save the world as a warrior  and shin comes to her aid to help her with her martial arts . shin teaches her the skills of a snake  tiger  etc . and she has to learn certain techniques to save the world .  br    br   this movie is great for kids who want to learn about martial arts and the chinese culture but the acting and casting was horrible .  br    br   brenda song is a comedic actress and i can  t see her playing a serious role . it was laugh out loud funny watching her cry over shin . shin couldn  t act at all  and everything was totally unbelievable .  br    br   i watched this movie and tried to think of something similar  and the thing i came up with was the power rangers . this movie is so fake and the stunts were so power ranger  esquire that it was just corny and stupid . the characters weren  t likable and i just couldn  t stand to watch it . disney really needs to take time to make some decent movies . high school musical is the only movie that deserves to be on disney channel  along with other movies like jumping ship  color of friendship  go figure  read it and weep   stuck in the suburbs .  br    br   if you like action  adventure and corny jokes  you  ll like this movie .  ,0
as you may know  the subject here was to ask eleven directors from all over the world to make each a short movie of   minutes   seconds and one frame . we have here   samira makhmalbaf  iran   what afghan refugee kids can understand to the towers collapsing  well  nothing . a great lesson .  claude lelouch  france   a weak plot with a great cinematography . . . just imagine a deaf woman living by the wtc who sees without understanding it that her dog barks . . . well just see it .  youssef chahine  egypt   the greatest oriental movie maker has compassion . . . for everyone  for an us soldier who died ten years ago  for the people in the wtc but also for a palestinian suicide  terrorist . maybe the less tender movie towards the us .  danis tanovic  bosnia hrzgovia   good images  makes us travel  for sure . . . not a very good plot . idrissa oudraogo  burkina faso   from one of the poorest country in the world  a tender and funny story about five boys who want to capture osama bin laden . . . and they could have done it but nobody believes them when they tell they know where he is . ken loach  uk   september         the chile entered in a twenty  years long bloody dictature . thousands of death  tortures  all that was offered to chile by henry kissinger and the cia  and knowing this changes very much your point of view  i guess that is because of that particular short that no american movie distribution company accepted to release the movie in us theaters  loach forgot to point that     is also the year when the wtc was built   alejandro gonzalez inarritu  mexico   impressing images that we all know too well  and a lot of black screens . i didn  t get this one very much  it is more an artist video  to show in an exhibition  than a movie .  amos gita  isral   an absurd ballet of policemen  journalists  etc .  around a burning car in jerusalem . very well done .  mira nair  india   about the anti  islamic feeling that followed september the   th . very good actualy .  sean penn  us   a funny little story that reminds us a fact usualy forgotten  the wtc did have a huge shadow  and some places now have a daylight they never had .  shohei imamura  japan   a different one . here there is not even one word about the wtc  and the action takes place at the end of wwii . it has only one message  no war is holy . this short movie gives very deep feelings  but the director aparently would have done better with more than   minutes .    so    a great movie  a great attempt to take the world  s temperature . i love it .  ,1
in watching this early demille work  it was once again reinforced to me that early demille is far superior to late demille . his attention to use of light within scenes is remarkable . his pacing is very good  enabling much to be told in the space of an hour or so . it is a pity that he wasn  t as intuitive about the style of his later sound films as he seemed to be in his silent films .  br    br   this was the first film in which i had seen cleo ridgely . she was remarkable  quite restrained and yet conveyed a broad spectrum of emotions .  br    br   the ending is wonderful .  ,1
i didn  t know what to make of this film . i guess that is what it was all about really . i have never seen a film like it and i doubt that i really ever will again . glover puts together something that is unique to him . i think to appreciate it you have to read some of his poetry  maybe see one of his slide shows . i really like this guy  he is just so bizarre i can  t help it . note i saw this film before it was through its final editing  so maybe what i have seen and what others have seen are different . i will know  i guess  if i choose to view the film again . i think i will have to be properly drug influenced . . .  ,1
the name uwe boll is automatically linked to bad horror  cult cinema and every new movie he releases  which is about two  three per year  immediately always receives negative ratings and harsh criticism . you  re actually almost tempted to think this is just a contemporary hype . you know  like it  s popular to hate uwe boll whether you liked his movies or not . let me just assure you that this is not the case . uwe boll is a terrible writer  director and quite frankly a menace to the entire film  making industry .  seed  is another most unfortunate of proof that . in here  boll tries so desperately hard to come across as controversial and shocking that he overlooks numerous other elements that any movie essentially needs to exist  like a plot  a narrative structure  character development  tension building  seed  is a hideous movie  full of gratuitous filth and incompetent padding footage . i once read that  seed  was uwe boll  s interpretation of the nowadays popular horror trend of torture porn flicks  but that  s not even close . the film inarguably does borrow some influences from  saw  and  hostel   but basically it  s just another umpteenth dull slasher with an indestructible killer and video game violence .  br    br   the first   minutes of  seed  are beyond boring and actually just confirm all the obvious things you already knew were going to happen . for you see  boll was stupid enough to begin his film with a  hyper  fast  scrolling text explaining there  s a federal us law claiming that death row prisoners have to be set free if three attempts to electrocute them fail . so you know this will happen later on  but still the first three quarters are wasted on catching a serial killer and bringing him to the electric chair . seed is a mute serial killer who supposedly slaughtered    victims  exaggerate much   who wears a bag over his head . he watches real  life animal cruelty footage  and thus we watch real  life animal cruelty footage thanks for that mr . boll  and videotapes people as the slowly decompose in their cellar  including a crying baby which is really sick and twisted  . when he  s finally captured  during the most amateurish and implausible police manhunt ever filmed  and put on death row  the film even becomes more retarded . after being buried alive because the electric chair couldn  t fry him  max seed crawls back to the surface and goes on a brand new killing spree this time mainly focusing on the people who arrested and executed him .  br    br   the senseless plot twists and complete lack of story depth of this movie go way past being just bad they  re downright infuriating and insulting the intelligence level of the average horror movie fanatic . multiple twists and sub plot in  seed  are simply impossible to accept by the reasonable functioning human mind because they  re just too dumb  nobody believes that cops and prison staff members will just bury a mass murderer alive without shooting a few bullets through his head first . nobody will accept that a fugitive convict cannot be found for another six months even though he went straight back to the exact same hideout place where they first caught him   seed  is full of retarded little things like these and the movie gets dumber with each minute that passes . personally  i refuse to accept that the cast  crew members didn  t notice this as well . it really makes you think that uwe boll simply neglects all advice and criticism  and just stubbornly shoots his movies the way he wants to . i imagine his yelling stuff like  shut up and do as you are told  to his actors whenever they remark that the scene they  re shooting doesn  t make a lick of sense .  br    br   just for the fun of upsetting people  there  s a gigantically overlong sequence where max seed smashes an elderly lady to death with a hammer whilst she  s tied up to a chair in the middle of her own living room . instead of shocking  as boll intended it to be  this sequence masterfully epitomizes how pathetic and wannabe controversial the whole film in fact is .  seed  is horrendous  it  s disgusting  it  s pitiable  it  s  boll .  ,0
i have seen many  many films from china  and hong kong . this is the worst . no  the worst one was  unknown pleasures  . i watched  platform  yesterday evening and thought that jia zhang ke  s other two films must be better . this evening i was disappointed again . i will not be watching  xiao wu  tomorrow evening because i have just placed all three films in the bin  whoever gave this film   platform  ten out of ten  needs to watch more cinema  the photography was very poor it was very difficult to differentiate between some of the characters because of the lack of close  up work . the storyline was so disjointed that i fast  forwarded it towards the end out of pure frustration . i would not recommend this film to anyone . give me zhang yimou or chen kage any day . these are true masters of chinese cinema  not pretentious con men   ,0
i wish i could laugh again as much as when i saw this show for the first time . i have not done so ever since .  br    br   the strange thing is  i find myself laughing almost as hard after watching the show again  and again .  br    br   eddie izzard is cultivated  is poignant  is a man of the world . he is deft talking about politics and yet feels no need to  engage  in political discussion . he is above that . i would contrast him to george carlin  who uses his comedy to try and convince people about his ideas  and does not seem to enjoy the fact that he is trying to entertain .  br    br   funniest guy on earth  ,1
i had a personal interest in this movie . when i was   and just out of high school i got a job at   th century fox as a member of the laborers and hod carriers union . at the end of my first day  sweeping the deck of an aircraft carrier  i was told to bring a suitcase the next morning with enough clothes etc . for one or two weeks . when i arrived the next morning a bus was waiting and about   of us headed south toward san diego . just short of there we stopped at an army base called either camp callan or camp hahn . once we were bunked in we went north a few miles into camp pendleton  the big marine base . there  on the beach  we started building what was supposed to be a japanese pacific island base . it took us about a week or ten days to complete the installation  which included a water tank  gun entrenchments  sand  bagged trenches and living quarters . all this was at very high pay  sometimes  golden time   which was triple our regular hourly wage . our food was also first rate  prime rib at lunch  etc .  which was amazing because it was wartime and very hard to get good meat at home .  br    br   once the job was finished i waited eagerly for the movie to come out  which was about eight or ten months later . then i waited eagerly through two hours of the movie before my handiwork finally came on screen . then it was no more than three or four minutes  maybe less  of the movie  s heroes dive bombing the base and blowing it to smithereens . a bit disappointing  but still fun .  br    br   in spite of the disappointment i enjoyed the movie and have not seen it since . i learned later that this movie was underwritten by the government and fox was paid on a cost plus basis  which maybe accounts for our extravagant pay and lifestyle down there . bob weverka  ,1
in the    s  charlton heston starred in sci  fi flicks of varying quality .  soylent green  is one of the better ones . he plays robert thorn  a detective in     new york . in this future  most food is so expensive that everyone needs a product called soylent green . but when thorn finds out the unsavory truth about this product  he finds himself on the run .  br    br   i guess that it  s only natural that this movie should seem dated to us nowadays . but even so  it still brings up interesting questions about what will become of our agriculture . also starring leigh taylor  young  chuck connors  brock peters  joseph cotten and edward g . robinson  in his final role  .  ,1
  .     . this movie has absolutely nothing good about it . the acting is among the worst i have ever seen  what is really amazing is that everyone is awful  not just a few here and there  everyone . the direction is a joke  the low budget is hopelessly evident  the score is awful  i wouldn  t say the movie was edited  brutally chopped would be a more appropriate phrase . it combines serial killings  voodoo and tarot cards . dumb . dumb . dumb . it is not scary at all  the special effects are hopelessly lame . laughably bad throughout . the writing was appallingly bad . the cinematography is real cheap looking  and very grainy sometimes  and the camera  work is dreadful . again  what really does the movie in is how badly all the actors are . cheesy .  ,0
i saw this film first on my way home from paris to newark aboard air france in august     . the film itself i believe is quite a masterpiece . it  s the kind of film that people should be making . i still think daniel auteuil is one of the sexiest actors around . in this french film  he plays a divorced father and businessman who has lost his zest for life until he across a down syndrome man who lives in an institution with other down syndrome patients . the actors including the actor who actually has down syndrome create a believable friendship and relationship between these two unlikely men . daniel  s life and ours changes forever with the down syndrome man . he realizes that life is not just work and not play but for the living and loving and that  s what life should be all about . the ending is kind of silly though but i still think it  s one of my favorite movies . it  s enough to bring a tear to your eye .  ,1
whoa . in the twin cities  we have a station that shows a  big bad movie  monday through friday . tonight  s nugget was a film with carrie fisher called  she  s back  about a really annoying woman who ends up getting murdered when thugs break into her house . bea  beatrice  comes back to haunt her husband . she wants him to seek revenge on her killers  hence  she  s back  . and she won  t let him rest until he does so . she irritates him endlessly . . . and the viewers  too  this movie is truly one of the worst movies i  ve ever seen . hey  i like bad movies  though  my fave movie is xanadu  . i was really shaking my head throughout the whole film  wondering who thought this would be a good idea for a movie . bea is just so annoying . the plot is silly the acting is bad the story . . . well  you get my drift . anyway  if you wanna see a really bad movie  really really bad movie  check this one out . you won  t be disappointed . heh .  ,0
another example of the unique talents of cary grant . a performance worthy of oscar consideration  yet once again shunned by the academy . mr . grant runs the gamut from silly to tender in this marvelous comedy about a man who decides to move out of the big city . the pitfalls of building a home are well chronicled and became the basis  loosely  for the more modern tom hanks vehicle   the money pit  .  br    br   if you like good old fashioned comedy without the cursing and the gratuitous sex  this movie is a must see .  ,1
i  like many horror fans  have been force fed the same banal big budget hollywood remakes and mtv high school slasher tripe for the last   years . here  at last  is an original horror genre movie that ticks all the right boxes .  br    br   you want a hot lead actress  you want vampires  you want cool weapons  you want cool vehicles and you want blood  lots of it  by the bucket load  you got it .  br    br   with excellent fight choreography and a supporting role from the hammer horror scream queen herself stephanie beacham  this really is fantastic stuff .  br    br   despite it  s low budget  by opting to use   mm stock and adding quality cg effects to the mix  director james eaves has created something that feels much bigger .  br    br   a must for old school horror fans .  ,1

this is a film that belongs firmly to the    s . very surprising that american film institute has chosen this one for one for the best    american movies of all  time . i have seen practically all of the movies on that list  and this one is by far the most disappointing one of those . musical numbers  and there many  many of them  are very overlong and boring  and have absolute no connection with the story . the end of the movie has horribly over  long ballet sequency  which naturally has no real relation to the story of the movie . it must be admitted  that it is very well made  the music is ok  and the dancing done with the highest professional standard  but there is no real reason why the sequence is included in the movie .  br    br   the main character of the movie is extremely childlish and unlikeable and behaves in unpolite way . his mental age is about   . if you want to see a good musical made on the  golden age  of musicals  go and see  singing in the rain  .  ,0
assassin hauser  s  john cusak  mission is to whack a mid  eastern oil minister  whose name happens to be omar sharif  neikov   in the country of turaqistan which is run by american interests . hauser poses as trade show producer to allow him to get to omar .  br    br   sometimes a satire can be so overdone it becomes most annoying . here it does too much the government  politics  music  war  people not generally accepted by society  and did i mention  war .  and  that is what we have here  a most annoying movie that borders on a very bad nightmare brought to life . i am still asking myself why i continued with the dvd . also  there are so many cusak family members in this that john cusak appears embarrassed by the family just being there  or is that just me   br    br   it used to be that a john cusak movie  while a little offbeat  was  in the end  rather good . not here . believe that john cusak had a hand in the writing and producing of this mess . make of that what you will .  br    br   there is too much going on in the movie accompanied by constant gun  fire  bombings  and shouting that you really cannot focus or was that the point  probably . it just takes too long to set up the hit  which is largely forgotten until the last    minutes . in the meantime we have meaningless banter among all in the cast . and  chemistry between john cusak and marisa tormei  i don  t think so  but you know the boy  girl thing and they needed something to take up more time .  br    br   yes  for what they were supposed to be   offbeat and annoying  the performances of duff  and kingsley were good . but  when i saw dan aykroyd  s character  in the beginning of the show  sitting on a toilet taking a dump  i knew the rest of the show would go to the tank as well . i was not wrong . i am sure some will sing praises of this effort  but if a rose is still a rose by any other name so  too  is a mess  br    br   i now remember why i continued with the dvd . i was hoping that the story would somehow level out and save itself . never did .  br    br   violence yes . sex no . nudity no . language yes .  ,0
i  ve received this movie from a cousin in norway and had to convert it from norwegian to american format with a copied video . comparing this film       with the heroes of telemark        kampen om tungtvannet  the struggle for the heavy water  casts the saboteurs themselves  playing their respective roles  though actors were also cast to play the roles of the saboteurs who have given their lives in norway  s struggle for freedom in later campaigns . the plot is in four languages norwegian along with french  german and english  complete with norwegian subtitles  .  br    br   impressive during this course of history was what led to the struggle . french scientists were interested in obtaining some two hundred kilograms of heavy water from norsk hydro in vemork to take back to france in order to do lab studies on its effectiveness . simultaneously  the nazis  too  were interested in obtaining heavy water to build a secret weapon . the french were worried that the nazis might take an early lead by invading norway  and through secret codes  their man carefully eluded nazi spies on his trip to oslo where he received the heavy water and making it back without hindrance . he was watched by two spies as he boarded an airliner  but they did not see him hop out on the other side where he crossed the tarmac to another plane nearby where his cargo was waiting for him . this clever trick worked by using the airliner as a decoy that the nazis later forced down in hamburg .  br    br   however  the invasion of norway on the morning of april        the nazis took over norsk hydro and it was up to the norwegian underground and british intelligence in london to take action . professor leif trondstad volunteered the services of eleven young norwegians the  swallow  and  gunnerside  groups who would successfully sabotage the heavy water production in vemork . this was shown in detail on how they actually carried out the operation  including the sinking of the ferryboat after the nazis abandoned norsk hydro to take the shipment of heavy water on rail cars to berlin .  br    br   the quality of the film was fair though there were many splices in the film . i highly recommend this film to anyone interested in world war ii history .  ,1
this is not an all  around terrible comedy  but it is very dull . it has barely any laughs  and it wastes its lavish production values . there is one poignant moment near the end  when fu manchu offers a dose of his elixir to his  nemesis  and tells him that  you  ve been my one worthy adversary and now we can start all over again  . that scene  however  along with burt kwouk  s amusing cameo in the beginning  are the only memorable parts of the movie .        ,0
as others have mentioned  all the women that go nude in this film are mostly absolutely gorgeous . the plot very ably shows the hypocrisy of the female libido . when men are around they want to be pursued  but when no  men  are around  they become the pursuers of a   year old boy . and the boy becomes a man really fast  we should all be so lucky at this age   . he then gets up the courage to pursue his true love .  ,1
this straight  to  video duffer is another nail in the coffin of rick moranis  s career . as is the disney tradition  quality is sacrificed in the name of a quick cash  in this is a lazy retread with moranis accidentally shrinking himself and a few relatives so they can repeat all the best scenes from the original movie . instantly dated visual effects and crummy dialogue abound in this cheesy lamer  which did nothing but make me pine for the days of  the incredible shrinking man   when this kind of thing was done properly . shockingly  this is directed by top cinematographer dean cundey  who should either stick to the day job or pick better material next time .  ,0
hunky geordie robson green is owen springer  a young doctor who moves home to manchester to be near his father . along the way  he falls for anna  a woman   years his senior  and who happens to be the wife of his new boss  richard crane . despite warnings from his new colleagues  owen proceeds to get anna for himself  going as far as to sabotage anna and the cheating richard  s marriage . this is a romantic drama with many humorous undertones and a quick wit . the actors are superb green of  the student prince  and  touching evil  smolders on  screen as the cunning  yet warm  hearted owen annis of  dune  fame is lively and proves a good match to green kitchen  from  to play the king  is the right menace as richard  whose comic missteps and snobbery underline his masterful  building hatred for owen . this is a perfect love triangle  and despite the foibles and fallacies of our three characters  you come away better for knowing and watching them .  ,1
i  ve seen this movie today for the first time and i never heard of it before  probably because of it  s poor message .  br    br   first of all  the directing itself is quite good  the actors played well and the cgi  i  m not a fan of cgi  is magnificent . but that alone doesn  t make a movie . no story at all  no message behind beautiful exploited talents .  br    br   or do i have to make people remember  the art of a director is not only your vision but to know how to tell a story . and this is what  s missing the whole  minutes .  br    br   there for a simple  rating .  ,0
this movie has always been a favorite of mine since first seeing it as a   year old kid in     when it was shown on a los angeles television station  s  late show  . the characters are very engaging from the start of the picture  and it is too bad that the movie has never been released for video tape  nor is it ever shown on television  apparently due to a prohibition by the estate of moss hart  the playwright  producer  director who wrote the story and first presented it on the new york stage during wwii   the reason for denying its showing is hard to fathom more than   years after it was made  . i did not see the movie again for over   years  when someone who had actually been a major cast member of the movie was able to get me a  bootlegged  copy on vhs  poor video quality  but good audio  . my memory of it was correct it was still an engaging and fascinating movie to watch . an amazing aspect of this film is just how many of its stars  just starting out in their careers at the time       went on to became either major motion picture stars or at least well  known and fully  employed actors  e . g . judy holliday  edmond o  brien  jeanne crain  barry nelson  don taylor  karl malden  peter lind hayes  george  superman   reeves  red buttons  lee j . cobb  kevin mccarthy  and gary merrill  . the scenes with the b    liberators are terrific  especially the close  up shots where the details of the giant  for those times    engine bomber  then        manufactured  now nearly extinct  can be seen . good insight into the different levels of training that a pilot  cadet went through on his way to being assigned to a bomber crew  of course  very gender  biased as was the trend of the day only the men became pilots  the women just supported them in their roles   hardly acceptable in today  s world  . i hope someday it will be released onto video for a new generation to enjoy .  ,1
well  this is an ivan reitman film . with the rare exception  ivan likes to entertain . his films generally aren  t  deep   but they are often entertaining enough . my super ex  girlfriend surprised me in that i laughed more than i thought i would . uma thurman is just so grand  and i love her portrayals . i like luke wilson too  and rainn wilson was a straight hoot . never taking itself seriously  the film is over the top and yet isn  t very unique  nor does it go where no one has gone before . . . . it  s a nice rent though and probably an ok date movie  especially if you have a headache and don  t want to strain your brain . it  s escapist fun and there  s nothing wrong with that . when you strip away the  super  girl  stuff  you  re left with a story about relationships  and relationships gone bad . it  s a boy meets girl  boy leaves girl thing . and in the end  the characters are looking for love . not all of them take being  dumped  as well as they could . . . . a slice of life with a twist .  ,1
even if       of people that has seen this movie is brazilian  i  ll keep up with the english since it is the language of this website .  br    br   this movie is a piece of crp . worst acting i have seen for a loooong time . the kids are terrible . specially the boy . this was the first time i saw someone with less facial expression than arnold schwarzenegger  and one single voice tone  like a  years  old kid reading in front of the class . how can someone so bad be the main actor of a movie  the storyline is so shallow my daughter could have done better  she is  yrs old  . it is so simple it could be written in a napkin and told in  minutes .  br    br   there are only three possibilities for someone enjoy this movie   you are a pre  teen   you have been so brainwashed by globo  s stupidities that you think that anything that has the globo  s seal is awesome   you have a serious brain damage .  br    br   avoid at all costs  a shame to the brazilian movie scene .  ,0
one of the last classics of the french new wave . for direction  cineaste jean eustache drew from the simplicity of early  century cinema for story  eustache drew on the torments of his own complicated love life . so many things can be said of this film  observationally brilliant self indulgently overlong occasionally hilarious emotionally draining . . . etc . etc . in my mind  whatever complaints that can be leveled against this film are easily overshadowed by its numerous strengths . every film student  writer  or simply anyone willing to handle a  hour film with no abrupt cuts  no music video overstyling  no soap opera  like plot twists  and no banal dialogue should make it a point to see this movie . everything is to be admired the writing  concise  clever  surprisingly funny   acting  everyone  quite simply  is perfect in their respective roles   and  simple direction  the viewer feels like a casual observer within the film  make this film unforgettable . this is undoubtedly a film that stays with you .  ,1
i must say  i thought i had seen it all . i am an extremely jaded movie buff . this movie didn  t shock me  by any means . i  m way past that point . but it did take me to certain emotional places i didn  t know i could go to . i had no idea i could ever find  ick  the idea of beastiality erotic . never never never . ever . ever . but there you go . he did it . i have to give the director credit . he pulled it off .  br    br   for the first   minutes this movie is a total bore . we start off with some very explicit footage of two horses having sex . after five minutes of this i started wondering if buying this movie wasn  t a mistake . then an old guy in a wheelchair talks to some other old guy about two people getting married . then some nervous guy shaves . then we see  briefly  a hot chick getting it on with a butler  but this is very brief  . at this point i was cursing the movie out loud while trying to stay awake . in fact  i fell asleep at about the   minute mark and forced myself to finish it the next night .  br    br   we finally get the good stuff when a girl  who knows who she is  or who anyone is in this movie  has a dream about a victorian  era gal being ravaged by a beast  thing in the forest . the scene goes on for quite some time and is really the meat  heh  heh  of the whole deal . it  s beautifully shot  superbly edited  and does deliver the goods . they do try to wrap up the plot at the end and it sort of makes sense but sort of doesn  t either . oh well . i would definitely recommend this film . the first   minutes made me want to shoot myself  and my tv  but the last   minutes totally redeems it .  ,1
this is an ok adaptation  but not as good as the tv version . the actors are generally alright but i found jeremy northam rather wet as mr knightley  particularly compared to mark strong in the tv version . gwyneth paltrow is ok and her english accent is pretty good but again  i preferred kate beckinsale  s emma . there are excellent support performances from toni collette  juliet stephenson and sophy thompson .  br    br   the script is often played too much for laughs  the book is a comedy  but there are too many set  piece gags here  and also the frank churchill subplot is almost completely absent .  br    br   my biggest criticism is the scenery . it is far too lush . england has never been like this . it looks like a chocolate box . only americans would make it like this .  br    br   despite these criticisms i enjoyed this film but would recommend the tv adaptation more .  ,1
  anita and me  is a drama about growing up in multi  ethnic britain  rather like  bend it like beckham   or more closely   east is east   with which it shares a     s setting . the tone is resolutely chirpy  in spite of the dour black country accents   but the film lacks  east is east  s vigour and the result seems rather thin and trite . moreover  the portrayal of the film  s central relationship  between an asian girl and her white friend  is insufficiently deep to justify the way that the movie is structured around it . i have also grown tired of films where the hero years to be a writer  this is naturally often something that real writers have experienced  but hardly a fresh element in a fictional story .  east is east  was fun and sharp  anita and me  seems obvious and dull in comparison .  ,0
i was interested in seeing this movie because i knew it was christian based . the director had a good idea  intentions when making this movie but it could have been better . i can understand why someone would still have feelings for who they believe is the greatest love of their life . however  i didn  t understand why the director made his friends so insensitive  mean and rude . the main character kept apologizing to his friends when they were the ones mean to him . they weren  t understanding at all and they used god as a reason to explain their behaviors . the main character  nor anyone else didn  t know if the ex  girlfriend was divorced  still married etc but they were against him resolving old feelings that needed to be dealt with . his friends were suppose to be christians and should have been portrayed as being supportive whether they agreed with his decision or not . so many times we do things in life where we don  t apologize to those we have hurt in the past and when he was trying to do this they were all against him . the ironic part was his new female friend accused him of having stalking behavior for simply looking up an old friend  when she did a really odd thing to get a hold of his name  address and phone number . . . she seemed to be the stalker  . she didn  t seem like a friend at all but was only looking out for herself . god is love . . . and i think god wants people to be with the person they were meant to be with and i feel the movie did a terrible injustice by making it seem like god doesn  t care about true love . . . only that you stay with someone you made a bad choice with . we all make mistakes . . . it  s all about what steps you take to make amends . like i said the movie had potential but i was tired of the one  sided point of view being constantly repeated and jammed down the viewers throat by his so  called . . . well  meaning friends . this movie didn  t hold true to the christian belief of love but i give it a c for its effort .  ,0
nothing    outta  stars  another weird premise from the director of the movie  cube  . this time around there are two main characters who find themselves and their home transported to a mysterious white void . there is literally nothing outside of their small two  story house . intriguing to be sure  but i thought the comedic tone established for this movie from the get  go was extremely ill  conceived . there needs to be some humour  certainly . . . and i have no problem with the humour that was eventually derived from the plight of our two heroes  their final  showdown  was definitely a hoot  . . . but i really think the movie would have been a lot better off if it had stayed more rooted in reality in the beginning . after watching the movie i watched the  making of  feature on the dvd and a short trailer at the end is almost totally devoid of the  sillier  comedic aspects . . . making it look like a completely different  and slightly better  movie . the last half hour of the movie is where things really start to come together . . . similar in a way to the recent movie  primer .  the actors are fine when they are not overdoing the comedy shtick . they are really quite believable in their more  normal  moments . i was probably ready to write this movie off as a failed experiment at the midway point . . . but it won me over by the end .  and keep watching past the credits for the final scene . . . just don  t ask me to explain it .   ,1
what could be more schlocky than the idea of private detectives getting involved with the women they  re supposed to be spying on  and most of the dialogue as written is perfectly banal .  br    br   but the actors turn the dialog into something that makes sense . you can see real people behind the unreal lines . and the directing is wonderful . each scene does just what it has to and ends without dragging on too long .  br    br   i showed this to several friends in the mid    s because i was perplexed at how such bad material could be made into such a good movie . the friends enjoyed it too .  ,1

i have seen this film only once  on tv  and it has not been repeated . this is strange when you consider the rubbish that is repeated over and over again . usually horror movies for me are a source of amusement  but this one really scared me .  br    br   do not read the next bit if you have  nt seen the film yet  br    br   the scariest bit is when the townsfolk pursue the preacher to where his wife lies almost dead  they  d been poisoning her  . he asks who the hell are you people anyway . one by one they give their true identities . the girl who was pretending to be deaf in order to corrupt and seduce him says  i am lilith  the witch who loved adam before eve  .  ,1
in what appears an attempt to mix drama and comedy  manuel gomez pereira made this film   things that make life worthwhile .  it is not an original discovery  by many voice you have  quite off the pitch  by the way   but it departs somewhat from the norm in the spanish cinema . the downside is that the elements forming the film are poorly combined  and while some points are not well developed  others are out of place . a day in the lives of two people close to the median age . it  s basically what the movie gmez pereira . jorge  eduard fernandez  is a stationary  parado  one which  despite load on your back with a drama major  seems willing to see things change . only this explains his commitment to a minor could mean a turning point in its existence . in line with audrey tautou of  long dating   jean  pierre jeunet        jorge says things like this to herself  if i find a coin before the corner that is now going to change my luck .  of course it finds it  begins to play  today could be a great day   hoy puede ser un gran dia  by joan manuel serrat and in a few crosses on its way hortensia  ana belen  . she is another woman entry age  divorced and a little lonely . take valeriana for sleeping  organizes birthday parties as an exemplary mother  said her belief in god and leads to a speed of homicidal mother . hortensia is a woman of many contradictions in his behavior  life was going in his head driving data as     of people fall in love only once in a lifetime  and said although it is short of jorge and unemployed and does not preclude the possibility that it is a  sadistic  sleeping in his shoulder in the cinema at the earliest opportunity . later came a communion  a dance in the luxurious wedding banquet  the back of a car and other things that players seem to live unique experiences like that but end up doing quite heavy for the viewer .  things that make life worthwhile  debate between us is the drama of two adult persons who have no other that leads them to see where their strange relationship and  conversely  make us take the case as a comedy  focusing on things like a chinese singing at a wedding  which seem to be amusing in itself  or the gait of a drunk person . the problem is that it does not leave us time to connect with the players  therefore we can not identify with the dramatic  and not give us a solid base comic too  leaving everything except pure joke . in the end  all mixed in a way that the viewer no longer know very well whether to laugh or mourn  and ends up not doing either . and it is true that something is not seen a thousand times  is not the kind of film that we find to bend every corner  but it is not sufficiently different or special as we want to do . ana beln  which apparently far less than the   years that has in this film  and eduard fernandez are two actors who are very enjoyable to see working  but this time it seems ready or comfortable enough in scenes that require him to break the calm that prevails in the film  so in moments like the  accident  with the children of the bar thing seems to be slipping from their hands . perhaps a very dramatic change that has to do  but that is no excuse to lower our guard . in any case  both interpreters are erected easily the highlight of the function .  things that make life worthwhile  work only up to the modest level of entertainment . any claim that is beyond that point has not been fulfilled  as a romantic comedy or dramatic as that  we presume  they wanted to do  can not afford to have little moments finished successful  beyond bad  as that in which one of the characters talk and laugh  lost drunk  compared to a boy who remains in a coma in part because of him . neither do much for people like rosario pardo  making the typical friend launched whose biggest contribution to the film is the phrase  must be screwed over   and songs from the soundtrack  though significant  not just fit . it is true that the film by manuel gomez pereira has its hits  some of the moments involving jose sacristan   but the whole is a anodyne story  a film with good intentions and a nice result when the better .  ,1
i saw this show about    years ago . it was dam funny  when i first time i saw it was playing on etv  estonian television  and i started to like it . too bad that that show is on bad time for me . hyde is like a cool guy who likes to sing frank sinatra  and he comes on stupid ideas . he got these glasses which h are brown . i like it . and there  s fez . the group pervert . we all know what he does when his alone . . . . . he wants to get laid badly . he even had it with his boss in one episode . his from india . and there is michael  the stupidest guy on whole group  probably stupidest in town and his a cop  he is so stupid that i remember follows hyde says did u called cops   no michael comes in and says . does anyone know how to turn off siren  he is a town playboy . then comes jackie  who is former girlfriend of michael and then she  s hyde  s girlfriend . then is eric who  s son of grumpy war veteran and son of kitty the housewife . his one big pussy . but he loves donna  his girlfriend with who they plan for they  re marriage . donna is one hot girl . hmm what i forget  ah hyde lives in a basement .  ,1
an excellent example of the spectacular busby berkeley musicals produced in the early      s . audiences must  ve been very surprised to see james cagney in this type of vehicle . quite a contrast from his  public enemy   years earlier . cagney does add spark  interest to a rather routine tired out formulated storyline  plot . but the highlight of the movie is the  elaborate production numbers back to back . first with the conservative  honeymoon hotel  number  then followed by the very spectacularly eye dazzling  by a waterfall  sequence  followed by the closing  shanghai lil  sequence  cagney only participates in the last number hoofing it up on top of a bar counter with ruby keeler . the  shanghai lil  number with cagney is excellent but a bit of a comedown  anti climactic after the more exciting  incredibly mind boggling  by a waterfall  choreography . if i was the director i would  ve inserted the  shanghai lil  number in the middle  close with  by a waterfall   which blows the other  numbers out of the water so to speak  in my view the best of the  numbers . the  production numbers are the frosting on the cake  james cagney  s performance is added decoration to the cake . an outstanding musical achievement  a  star movie  the ultimate musical  well worth watching  you won  t be disappointed           ,1
how do i begin  this movie is probably one of the worst movies i have ever seen . it has no redeemable qualities . i just sat through this movie and it was a struggle . it failed to get even a single smile on my face . i find it hard to believe that anyone would distribute this horrible film . i felt that this movie was a failed attempt at distasteful humor . the only thing that was worth anything about this movie was the soundtrack  i  m pretty sure thats the reason i wanted to see this movie in the first place . i will wrap this up as i am going to try and forget the time i just wasted with this piece of crap . i will leave you with this warning . do not watch this film  it sucks .  ,0
i  myself am a kid at heart  meaning i love watching cartoons  still do  i remember watching bugs bunny when i was a kid  he was my favourite still is . i thought man  this was a great  new  show on tv  and than my dad said   bugs bunny  i remember watching him when i was younger  and i  m like   dad  bugs didn  t exist when you were younger  . so i guess he  s definitely pleased more than one generation  possibly  . i love the show it  s great for kids and adults  ok  everybody . it  s very funny  me and my husband  both in our   s  love watching the shows  and we don  t mind the re  runs either . this show brings back a lot of memories  happy ones . i love the christmas special too with tweety as tiny tim  it  s cute . i can  t pick my favourite looney toons character  because they  ve changed over the years . when i was little it was bugs of course  and porky pig . pepe is cool  i always loved him . actually  i have to say there all my favourite . i  m giving this show a   out of    because it  s a great show for all ages  very funny  voice acting is incredible  the only flaw is that unfortunately it came to an end   decades ago  but the re  runs are great   ,1
fassbinder  s most lavish production sacrifices little of his talent for identifying and deconstructing a locus of suffering in long  mobile takes that somehow also act as social encapsulations here  it  s much more overt  since the story takes place in war  torn germany at the end of wwii  and the central character is a woman  hanna schygulla as maria  who capitalizes on vulnerabilities  both economic and gender  related  to catapult herself up the ladder of a prominent textile corp . that makes coveted goods like lederhosen available to indigent workers  as she once was  . married amidst allied air raids  maria and her new husband herrmann are allowed a brief honeymoon before he  s shipped out to the russian front . in his absence  her despair is great she spends most days at the train station  waiting for him to return . when he is reported dead  she abruptly stops grieving and takes a job as a barmaid  prostitute at a brothel catering to american gi  s .  br    br   when he returns  things get plenty messy  as circumstances  and his sense of noble self  sacrifice  conspire to keep them apart . the message is fassbinder  s m . o . writ large  love is colder than death   but not only is maria contending with her own sanity and a husband largely incapable of loving her  but a country in deep flux with no discernible light at the end of the tunnel . fassbinder is making some kind of statement on post  war germany selling out to the highest bidder  but as with all his films  i tend to block those elements out and focus on the unbearable passions on display fassbinder  s as evoked through his characters his actors  as filtered through their real  life connections with fassbinder . taken together  his films can be either unbearable or indescribably mesmeric  often at once this falls somewhere in  between  although definitely closer to the latter . while i didn  t like it quite as much as the bitter tears of petra von kant or katzelmacher  maria braun certainly has a greater scope and what  s more  i could feel its passion and authentic detail to human emotions .  ,1
a horribly pointless and  worse  boring film . stranger than fiction has nothing new to say about anything  no characters beyond the most unimaginative stereotypes  and relies on a clunky central concept that is neither particularly original nor dealt with in a vaguely innovative way .  br    br   will ferrell is totally wasted in what he presumably hoped to be his answer to jim carey  s truman show  and substitutes his usual shouting routine  admittedly very funny if you discount talledega nights  for  well  pretty much nothing .  br    br   emma thompson is no more than mildly irritating  that some reviews i  ve read here are talking her up for an oscar nomination is laughable  whilst maggie gyllenhaal does a passable job with a very weak script that allows nothing beyond establishing her character as a former law student who dropped out of harvard to become a baker because she liked making people happy . please . that she ended up falling for ferrell  s  character  is utterly ludicrous .  br    br   marc forster  s attempts to jazz up the film using computer graphics only serve to highlight the uninspired the material he has to work with .  br    br   i had the choice of either going to watch the prestige for the third time or seeing this . i wish i  d opted for the prestige .  ,0
what ever possessed martin scorcese to remake this film  and not only did he remake it  completely ruin it  the nonsensical decision to make the character played by robert deniro  in his most overdone performance  and that  s saying a lot  into a religious fanatic is ridiculous  and exemplary of attitudes harbored by hollywood  and mr . scorcese especially   attitudes that compel writers to think that the best way to make a character insane is to tattoo a crucifix on his back . in any case  this movie is awful .  br    br    ,0
twenty years ago  the five years old boy michael hawthorne witnessed his father killing his mother with an axe in an empty road and committing suicide later . on the present days  michael  gordon currie  invites his girlfriend peg  stacy grant  and his best friends chris  myc agnew   jennifer  emmanuelle vaugier   lisa ann  kelly benson   ned  brendon beiser   mitch maldive  phillip rhys  and trish  rachel hayward  to spend the halloween in the country with his grandparents in their farm . he asks his friends to wear costumes that would represent their greatest innermost fear  and together with his indian friend crow  byron chief moon   they would perform an ancient indian celebration using the carved wooden dummy morty  jon fedele  that would eliminate their fears forever . the greatest fear of michael is to become a serial killer like his father  but something goes wrong and morty turns into his father  killing his friends .  br    br    the fear resurrection  is a disappointing and pointless slash movie that uses the interesting concept of eliminating the greatest innermost fear of each friend before it grows  but in a messy screenplay full of clichs . there are some exaggerated performances  like for example ms . betsy palmer others very weak  but in general the acting is good . unfortunately there is no explanation why the dummy is brought to live further  in spite of being surrounded by close friends  the group does not feel pain or sorrow when each one of them dies . the low  pace along more than fifty minutes could have been used to built a better dramatic situation . in the very end  michael shows a charm that his father was interested that i have not noticed along the story . i do not know whether the previous reference was edited in the dvd released in brazil with   minutes running time . the special effects are very reasonable for a b  movie . my vote is four .  br    br   title  brazil    fear   uma noite de halloween    fear   one night of halloween    ,0
now this is more like it  the first movie had some iffy dialogue and some weaker acting  but it seems like the team behind this got their stuff together for the sequel and put out a solid  thoroughly enjoyable  hilarious and creative comedy that will keep everyone on the edge of their seats the whole way through .  br    br   seriously  this is just full of great stuff  brimming with creativity  and it  s less of a spoof on   s movies at the same time . the scenes in hell are great  and so are the ones in heaven . there  s really no shortage to the mad  cap adventurous romp that this one promises  and you will never see another movie like this . even the hammy final act of the movie isn  t as bad as the first one  being generally heartwarming and enjoyable in its extremely clich repertoire of family fun movie bliss . and even keanu reeves  despite looking about    isn  t that bad here .  br    br   sounds like a good deal to me .  ,1
hrm  i think that line was from the old movie posters .  br    br   this is a dumb movie that seems to have been translated from some language that was totally unfamiliar to the translator . here  s a tip any movie that starts with a black screen and text reading  in the future . . .  is going to be fun . this means that the premise is so implausible that they have to explain it to you .  br    br   in this case   in the future . . .  means that  instead of fighting wars  nations have guys climb into giant robots and duke it out to determine  well  that  s never terribly clear  but it  s probably something really important . there are good guys  obviously capitalists  i . e .  us   and bad guys  commies   and there are big stop  motion robots .  br    br   sadly  the effects budget was pretty slim  so we don  t get to see a lot of the big robots . there are plenty of cheap looking interior scenes  and then a big space fight near the end . the space fight is especially nice  as it serves precisely no purpose other than the blow the remainder of the effects budget .  br    br   with said money now spent  the climactic fight degenerates into  and i  m not making this up  two guys hitting each other with sticks . i can always get a laugh in a bar by re  enacting the final scene  complete with a last line guaranteed to leave any audience scratching their heads .  br    br   like i said  it  s dumb . that  s why i bought the tape .  ,1
this one is a great one  robert de niro and cuba gooding have teamed up to make a powerful and very influential film . this is the true story of the first black us navy diver and the obstacles he faced in attaining his certification at the hands of a racist master diver . along the way  he must also face plain old bigotry from all of his classmates  none of whom want him in their class . they move out of the barracks when he arrives . ultimately  he becomes certified and goes on to have a great career as a us navy diver . watch this one  it  s a great tale of courage and honor . as the story unfolds  we get to watch racism slowly dissipate and everyone begins to respect men one at a time .  ,1
it  s a while ago  that i have seen sleuth       with two great actors michael caine and laurence olivier . michael caine is back  but he is now the husband and jude law the lover of his wife . the story is still the same and it  s a fantastic play .  br    br   during the movie i always had the feeling to watch a play . that  s one of the reasons i dislike this remake of a classic . when i watch a movie adapted a play i still must feel to see a movie and not just a play . director kenneth brannigan did some marvelous movies in the past  but this time he missed . another reason was the look of the movie . the design was modern  stylish clean  uncomfortable and cold . i never got the feeling that somebody ever lived in that house . the photography wasn  t bad  but the lightening was awful . sometimes there was blue light  dark  green light  to round it up not friendly for eyes .  br    br   the acting was really good . michael caine  s and jude law  s perform at their best . i really would like to see these  guys playing together on stage . but i have to confess i never was a fan of jude law . the weakest part was the mid part . i remember that in the original that this part was still very mysterious and just marvelous directed . i tried to watch it twice and always in the mid part i felt asleep . the end part is better and more interesting . sleuth       isn  t awful  but it seems to be more a movie for critics than for the audience . sleuth       is still a masterpiece and much more entertaining than sleuth       .  ,0
i believe shakespeare explained what i just read beautifully . me thinks he  the lady  doth protest too much . the whole thing sounded to me as if the author was trying to convince himself  he sites profane literature  writings from the same time period but not connected with the bible  a number of times however i can think of at least three references off the top of my head which lend historical accuracy to events contained in the bible . anyone can skew data  prove anything they like but it doesn  t make it true . customs change  word definitions change over time  look at english  german where it is very obviously a common root  nothing stays the same  it  s always growing and changing . the bible has many different translations but the king james version is the one i  ve found to be the best when it comes to any kind of research . in the king james version you will notice there are certain words written in italics . these words have been added by the translators and can be dropped  the mean of the entire verse changes . writings from around the time of christ were written without spaces  without punctuation  without paragraphs  without numeric verses . these writings look like one long word  the translators added all of the above . for example how would you read this godisnowhere do you read it as god is nowhere or do you read it as god is now here  same string of letters two entirely different meanings . this is why many biblical researchers use a  lexicon  to assist them in translation as it provides a word for word translation from the original arabic  greek or hebrew depending on the language in which the scripture was originally written . it  s also interesting to note that when translated into symbolic logic you can prove god exists but you can not prove he doesn  t exist  in the end i just love listening to people who think they are so smart that they are qualified to judge the almighty . talk about ego  putting soapbox away  god bless maegi  ,0

home room really surprised me . in comparison to other movies that were written regarding columbine high school this one is the best . home room does not show the school shooting but rather the aftermath and the effects of the community and the town . the movie focus  on two opposite characters .  alecia  busy phillips  and deanna  erika christensen  . alecia is an outcast who witnessed the entire shooting . she seems to show no emotion about it . deanna is a popular girl and the only surviving victim . alecia is forced to visit deanna at the hospital in order to graduate . meanwhile the police are investigating alecia as she might have known the shooting was going to happen . alecia and deanna are very different and do not get along at first . eventually they develop a mutual understanding for one another and become friends .  very much in the style of the breakfast club  . home room beautifully shows the power of closeness and turmoil after a school shooting . i would recommend this film to anyone and everyone .  ,1
if any show in the last ten years deserves a    it is this rare gem . it allows us to escape back to a time when things were simpler and more fun . filled with heart and laughs  this show keeps you laughing through the three decades of difference . the furniture was ugly  the clothes were colorful  and the even the drugs were tolerable . the hair was feathered  the music was accompanied by roller  skates  and in the words of merle haggard   a joint was a bad place to be  . take a trip back to the greatest time in american history . fall in love with characters and the feel good essence of the small town where people were nicer to each other . this classic is on television as much as  full house  . don  t miss it  and always remember to  shake your groove thing      ,1
the premise is a bit better than the execution  but that doesn  t mean the film is worth a look . splendid supporting cast makes this a fun mystery to unravel . raines is great as the resourceful woman determined to solve this puzzlement . i always enjoy thomas gomez .  ,1
in fact  it  s basically the same movie . and they couldn  t even get the time line of events correct . maybe that was intentional due to laziness or not caring . either way  this thing is a real woofer . it doesn  t even deserved to be called a movie . i viewed this as a so called second feature on the disc containing the original the boogeyman . i thought my head would explode  and i urge you to run as far in the opposite direction of this thing  if you should be cursed with the misfortune of combing across it  s path . it should come with a warning label likewarning  may cause your i . q to drop several points if you are within it  s vicinity . for me  there  s no doubt this thing is a      ,0
parker  johnathan schaech  is an aspiring writer who is still looking for his big break . in the meantime  he works as a telephone adviser for a manhattan psychic hotline . one day  most unfortunately  his apartment building burns down . parker and his cat make it out alive but are now stuck with the arduous task of finding affordable housing in the big apple . word comes to parker that a lady  samantha  alison eastwood  is searching for a roommate but will only accept a gay male . since parker is straight but the price is right  he decides to pretend that he is gay . samantha likes him from the start and welcomes him as her new cohabitant . but  poor parker . sam is lovely  intelligent and very desirable . how will he be able to keep his true nature under control  besides  doesn  t sam have a successful businessman  boyfriend anyway  this is a sweet  likable  and humorous film with two very attractive stars in eastwood and schaech . naturally  the plot is a string of  how can i keep up this ruse  scenes  with sam asking parker for shampoo while she is showering or pleading with him to hold her in bed when she receives bad news . also  it is necessary for parker to produce his own  fake  gay mate  boris  when sam insists upon fixing him up with a man she knows . hopefully  the gay community will not find this too offensive  as this viewer thought most issues were treated with sensitivity and subtlety . for a small scale movie  the costumes  sets  and camera work were quite nice  also . therefore  if you love those funny tales of love  get this one soon . you will like what you see  i know it .  ,1
i found  still crazy  to be marvelously entertaining  and not only to those of us who lived through that raucous era of late    s  early    s rock . my   year old daughter watches it with me every time i drag out the dvd  don  t worry  it  s only been three times  and she loves it too .  br    br   it is a truly loving  poignant and hilarious nod to the era  and every actor hits his  her notes with perfection . it was my first introduction to bill nighy and i am glad his somewhat similar turn in  love actually  brought him more attention . bruce robinson was incredible as brian  bringing real life to what could have been a caricature of the drug  damaged rocker stereotype . it was interesting to see that robinson has made quite a name for himself as a writer .  br    br   i live in sherman oaks  california  and after the first time i saw the movie i bumped into billy connolly at the local mall  he lived here at the time  and told him it was one of my five favorite films of all time . he invited me to sit down at the food court with him and we discussed the movie for some time . we even talked of the idea of an american  oriented remake before wisely dismissing that . why mess with the original   br    br   my only problem with  still crazy  is that it wasn  t hugely popular in theaters and too many people have missed out on a wonderful experience .  ,1
a very good wartime movie showing the effects of war on a hometown boy who looses his eyesight on guadalcanal and must come home and re  adjust himself with the help of family and friends . an excellent cast of actor  s helps make this movie very entertaining . eleanor parker  s role as the girlfriend was worthy of an oscar nomination . she has such an innocence to her in this movie . ann doran role was equally satisfying as was all of her small supporting roles . i especially like the hometown aura of pre  war phildelphia . the hunting scene is very good . of course the war scene on guadalcanal truly showed the horror faced by our soldiers during this epic battle . a well deserving film and one that should not be forgotten  ,1
  a very pretty red headed woman waiting for her plane meets a charming young man that she connects with . as the two get on their flight and sit next to each other the young man jack becomes deadly as he threatens lisa to either change the room that a politician and his wife will be staying in  or else have her father die . see now that  s what you happens when you fly coach  stuff like that never happens in first class .  br    br    other than having a conflict that takes place on a flight  the other thing that this movie shares with  flightplan  is the sheer unbelievability if that  s a word of the story . the point of the whole is to get the main character to change a politician  s room so he can be assassinated which is a pretty plausible plan  but won  t it have being easier for jack to just find someone that was computer savvy and have them hack into the hotel  s system  teenagers today can damn near do anything with computers  so i  m pretty sure it would have been easier for him to simply get someone to change it using a computer instead of going through the trouble of spying on lisa and getting her into the predicament that she lands on in the movie .  br    br    plus one thing that struck me as odd was how no one on the plan heard a single thing they were talking about . this is a very small plane were talking about here and since their voices were raised occasionally it seems to me like the other passengers should have heard something . but i  m     sure that i  m reading way too much into it . the movie is meant to be as realistic as an episode of     so one can  t be perplexed by such complexities . for all my complaints though  this is still a very fun movie that gets the job done . it  s not exactly the type that requires to shut of your brain  but at the same time it doesn  t require great intelligence to fully enjoy .  br    br    i  d love to sit here in my comfy chair and rave about the brilliant acting in the movie but really i can  t . i love rachel mcadams  i love cillian murphy  and i like brian cox  but they don  t really stretch their acting muscles here . it  s not really much of a problem since this isn  t the movie that studios hope to win multiple awards and the acting isn  t the least bit horrible  just not great . wes craven isn  t exactly the first that comes to mind when you think of a movie like this  but he does a very nice job considering the time they had to film the movie and the lack of depth to the script . it was definitely a huge improvement over the disappointing  cursed  and as much as i liked him doing something different with this movie  i still would love for him to go back to doing what he did in the past which is great horror movies that is talked about decades after it  s release .  br    br    one nice thing about the movie which i really appreciated was just how short the movie was . it is great to sit and watch a nice three hour or so movie once in a while  but nowadays it  s like every movie that comes out feels too long  where as this movie just felt like the right length . not too long  and too short . they don  t waste time by trying to develop the characters too much because they know this isn  t the movie for that and by doing so they made a very nice short movie . being a huge film music geek  i have to say that the best part of the movie is the ultra cool score by marco beltrami . it  s really nice to see beltrami go from writing the predictable stuff to the great music he  s doing now . i really the cool techno  orchestral stuff he does for the main titles . too bad that i can  t find the soundtrack anywhere  would have really loved to listen to the titles anytime i wanted instead of having to pop in the dvd when i want to hear it .  br    br    overall it  s nice for what it is and whiles it  s far from great cinema  should still provide for some small entertaining hour and a half  ,1
gregory peck  s acting was excellent  as one would expect  and the cinematography quite stunning even when playing directly into some melodramatic  moment .  but  the rest of the film was overacted and hard to watch  for me anyway . i tried to like it  but had to fast  forward through the last thirty minutes or so . i feel i wasted a couple of good hours . had it not been for gregory peck  i wouldn  t have lasted fifteen minutes .     .  ,0
hi all i am a chess enthusiast since the age of about  . i supposed i am quite obsessed by chess  but hopefully not as much as the central character in this film .  br    br   in this film  the central character reflects a real chess player called curt von bardeleben who committed suicide in     . he is famous for a game he played against steinitz  where a beautiful combination was played by steinitz . instead of resigning  he simply walked out of the tournament hall  never to return .  br    br   the social ineptness of the central character is unfortunately a treat of some of the more serious grandmasters you sometimes get in chess tournaments . chess i suppose is a very big sacrifice  and you can sometimes end up imbalanced in other areas of life . a major example of this is the chess legend bobby fischer . although a genius  he was also very disturbed in many ways .  br    br   in the film  a world championship match is depicted  as between an italian grandmaster and luzhin . the format is a knockout  which actually the world governing body of fide has sometimes employed as a format itself  going from    players to just  in the final . but this was a group knockout  which also depicts a realistic format  where the winners of each group play against each other .  br    br   the position before adjournment makes for a fascinating chess puzzle in itself . in fact  i have done a youtube video about it  for you to explore the winning combination in detail  enjoy  http   uk . youtube . com  watch  vxzptdtphwdm best wishes tryfon  ,1
ahh  yes  the all  star blockbuster . take a so  so concept  stuff it into a script and load it down with every single freakin  special effect that the wizards of hollyweird can conjure up  then round up the usual suspects hot up  and  comers  has  beens  wanna  be  s and never  wuzzes  and stick  em all in ensemble roles of various sizes in front of the unforgiving eye of the cameras . and hope to gawd that some of them aren  t too old to remember their lines .  br    br   leave it to the bishops of box office to apply the concept to horror films at last  as was the case with the post  exorcist thriller the sentinel . novelist jeffrey konvitz decided to try and one  up ira levin  s rosemary  s baby scenario of creepy  and ultimately satanic  neighbors in a new york brownstone . the result was a controversial best  seller that some claimed bordered on the plagiaristic  and an equally controversial  top  heavy  star  laden vehicle co  written and directed by death wish  s michael winner  but for many unsettlingly different reasons .  br    br   cristina raines  nashville  plays successful model alison parker  who is pretty much over  stressed and over  worked   i won  t add  overpaid .  i mean she is a model  so that would be redundant   not just by her     schedule  by also by her insistent   wanna  get  married  right  now  boyfriend michael  chris sarandon of dog day afternoon and the classic sob . i . g . movie lipstick  . one of the ways she decides to try to get away from it all is to move into her own place a big  beautiful brownstone in manhattan which she  s able to get dirt  cheap   that should  ve been the big red flag  cheap real estate in new york    from the mysteriously accommodating broker miss logan  golden age screen vet ava gardner  fresh from the storm drain in earthquake .   br    br   things seem fine at first  but ah  yes . . . then comes the noises and the loud pounding from the apartment upstairs at night . and what about the really strange neighbors like gerde  sylvia miles  and sandra  a very early beverly d  angelo   the nice  single friends   read lesbians  living together  and kindly old mr . charles chazen  a nicely creepy burgess meredith   who seems maybe a little too concerned with alison  s welfare  and that  s not to mention other assorted squirrelly cohabitants  you  ll never hear the phrase  black and white cat  black and white cake  again without wanting to laugh milk through your nose and possibly vomit simultaneously .  especially the old blind priest living in the penthouse . . .  br    br   things really start to go downhill when an apparition  laden nightmare of alison  s morphs into a grisly murder   in one of the movie  s most underwear  staining scares   and both alison and michael  with some assistance from alison  s bff  jennifer  deborah raffin   begin to piece together the puzzle that reveals the brownstone  s dark origins  as well as the murderous agenda of its other  worldly inhabitants  not to mention alison  s connection to them  which as it turns out is anything but coincidental .  br    br   although there  s nothing controversial about the overstuffed cast  which seems to feature every actor of diverse genres looking for work at the time   arthur kennedy  jose ferrer  martin balsam  eli wallach  john carradine  and even early appearances by christopher walken  jeff goldblum and nana visitor   winner and company went back to bombastic basics and pulled a  tod browning  . . . by enlisting real  life physically  challenged actors to appear in the sentinel  s climactic everything  and  everybody  goes  to  hell sequence  which i guess any ballsy director would do  finding himself unable to access linda blair and a case of green  pea soup . it does definitely leave you with arctic fingers playing your spinal cord like a zither  knowing this juicy little tidbit of info as you watch . and it does feature a technique to which filmmakers have only begun to return very recently live on  set makeup and special effects that don  t involve cgi   which was pretty much non  existent back then .   br    br   the sentinel has that kitschy  late  seventies cheese factor  but does manage to distinguish itself from time to time with some gasp  inducing moments like the one mentioned above  not to mention that queasy feeling of dread that horror writers find it easy to play upon  of isolation and things that go bump  and  shriek in the night . after all  what living  single  in  the  big  city person hasn  t lain in bed in the dark  and listened intently to the sounds of what they hope is  the building settling    br    br   konvitz followed up the sentinel with an inevitable sequel  the guardian  not to be confused with the william friedkin supernatural thriller namesake   that was never adapted for the screen . sigh of relief  ,1
as soon as it hits a screen  it destroys all intelligent life forms around  but on behalf of its producers i must say it doesn  t fall into any known movie category  it deserves a brand new denomination of its own  it  s a  neurological drama   it saddens and depresses every single neuron inside a person  s brain .  br    br   it  s the closest thing one will ever get to a stroke without actually suffering one . it drives you speechless  all you members go numb  your mouth falls open and remains so  and the most strange symptom of all is that you get yourself wishing to go blind and deaf .  br    br   no small feat for such a sort of a  movie  .  br    br   the only word that comes to my mind just having finished my ordeal is outrage        ,0
oh dear . i was so disappointed that this movie was just a rip  off of japan  s ringu . well  i guess the u . s . made their version of it as well  but at least it was an outright remake . so  so sad . i very much enjoy watching filipino movies and know some great things can come out of such a little country  so i can  t believe this had to happen . claudine and kris are such big names there  surprised they would be affiliated with plagiarism . to any aspiring movie makers out there in the philippines you do not have to stoop this low to make money . there are many movie buffs that are watching the movies filipinos put out and enjoying them   ,0
this series it  s  something different  . sometimes european series are less accurate than the usa ones  but this time authors have hit the right target creating a mix that works in a smoothly way . edel  starck is great  it has all great plot  smart  witty  always well delivered lines  an amazing theatrical timing showed by all the stars and beautiful shots of berlin  one of the most interesting city in the world . it  s entertaining to see how things works in the justice field in other countries than the usa and for once  feel  the old europe way of dealing with life . kudos to all the cast and crew for a well done comedy that is going to be a must to see in the years to come . watching the series in german is super .  ,1
well . . . easily my favourite tv series ever . call me a walking mail clich but include violence  mafia  sex  gambling  drugs etc . on a show and you  re already winning points on in my book . combine all that with acting that superceeds anything you  ve ever seen on the small screen  add directing that fits cinema of the vintage type and most of all writing that blows the mind  and a few brains a long the way  and you got yourself a show thats gonna be pretty tough to compete with .  br    br   above all stand two actors  james gandolfini as tony soprano  and edie falco as his wife carmela . . . as for gandolfini  he fits his roll in a way that words cannot express  if you haven  t seen him as tony yet see it now   br    br   i can go on and on and on about every character in the show  the psychological brilliance  the gripping scenes etc . but you wouldn  t be able to stop me so all i can say is that this is about the only show along with seinfeld  that i am able to watch over and over again from start to finish and end up enjoying it even more .  ,1
this movie deserves credit for its original approach . it combines elements of theater  film  and epic storytelling . unfortunately  it falls flat on all levels . the films biggest weakness is it  s unwillingness to commit to anything it has camp  moralistic  and epic elements without ever committing to any of them . as for the story itself  chretien de troyes is spinning in his grave at this horrible adaptation which turns the lovable  unbearably innocent percival into a most ungallant and rude churl .  br    br   most likely two types of people will see this  francophiles or arthuriophiles . speaking as one of the latter  i found the movie unwatchable and an incredibly shabby  disrespectful treatment of a beautiful story .  ,0
i think the comments regarding the show being cheesy are a bit too exaggerated . when a person comes to watch a tv show  what does he look out for  it is to enjoy that he watches a show  unless he  she is a critic or a person who analyzes story . but most of us are not so and watch the shows to relax and enjoy . full house is an ideal show to watch after having a heavy day in the office  school . it makes you laugh and it is not just humor .  br    br   yes  the tanner family is a perfect family  a perfectly hypothetical family . if any such family existed in real world  it would be a role model for us to follow . but this is a tv show  and not a real family  and there is nothing wrong in depicting a hypothetical family on television . the very fact that the show could run so long shows us that people enjoyed watching it  whatever be the comments later on .  br    br   another good point about the show is that any person of any age would not only enjoy watching it  but would take back a message however childish that message be . those jesse  s talks with michelle are extremely touching  if one doesn  t think of it as childish .  br    br   overall i would say after watching every show of full house  there is a contentment in your heart that is rarely present after many other shows .  ,1

this movie is being shown over and over on cable lately  so . .  br    br   there is no excuse for these  attractive women to fight over either luke wilson or the equally vapid  villian  in this movie . the female actresses are very cute  and that  s the only reason to watch this movie . i suppose it is  funny  that luke  s even uglier  dorkier  stupider friend is around  but well  that is what we get .  br    br   neither of the female leads would ever  ever talk to any of the males in this movie for more than  minutes . what we get is them sobbing and crying and fighting and so on over  guys that were best described in friday the   th  . dead   ,0
this programme bugs me  there is no humour to it and is far too serious to be called  fun   it  s just far too educational for my liking  the characters are very stereotyped and unappealing . the plots are redundant and the morals are just repeated over and over again . where  s the fun in it  also i feel this has been on the bbc for far too long and is broadcast way too much . does it really need to have a slot on t . v every  or  months when a brand new show runs out of episodes  i think it  s time that the bbc starting bringing back some of their older shows like inspector gadget  bananaman  the smurfs  snorks  moomins  the raccoons and count duckula other than continually giving contracts to these newer shows  i thought the bbc where bring back danger mouse  so what  s going on with that        ,0
i saw this movie last night and even after a couple of beers the only giggle this movie got out of me was when i realized that i was actually watching it . in a word  it is unfunny . unfunny . i totally believe the trivia tidbit about jack black apologizing for making this garbage . i can  t believe that barry levinson didn  t just toss this script when he read the first page . moreover  i can  t believe that i watched more than ten minutes of it .  br    br   i gave it  out of    because i love to see christopher walken make terrible movies for the paycheck . also  the horse  corky   by merely existing as a character in this movie  is actually quite ridiculous .  ,0
oh dear . yet another example of  oireland  and religion . no doubt we  ll be seeing some depressing nonsense featuring some  hunky and macho freedom fighters  from the ira . well that was my initial reaction when the credits started but just over an hour and a half later i was in a state of shock . what a superb movie  br    br   the story starts on the day of the wedding between sean cloney and sheila kelly in the     s . there is a slight problem since they  re getting married in the catholic church and that is sheila is a protestant but in order for the wedding to happen sheila takes a pledge that her children will be brought up catholic and attend the catholic school when they  re old enough . the story  which is set in the     s  then jumps forward a few years when the cloney daughters are about to start school but sheila has decided they  ll be attending the local protestant school much to the disgust of local priest father stafford . from there things escalate  br    br   let me put my cards on the table and state that despite having both irish catholic and scottish protestant heritage i was brought up as agnostic and have considered myself as an atheist throughout my adult life . in fact when it comes to religion i consider myself a marxist and religion is a cynical weapon used to manipulate people . a love divided shows what happens when self appointed moral guardians take it upon themselves to tell other people what to think and believe . may i have the temerity to state that if karl marx saw this movie he  d love it and call it a masterpiece  perhaps i shouldn  t since the drama of this story shows what happens when other people do your thinking for you  br    br   in reply to the couple of reviewers who have claimed this movie is propaganda of the worst sort i don  t claim to know the exact details of what happened in county wexford and there  s no denying that father stafford and his flock of catholic sheep are portrayed as being the bad guys but sheila isn  t blameless herself . think about a woman living in a rural village in     s ireland who takes a pledge to bring her children up as catholics then changes her mind and believes there will be no consequences of this  this is a warning against taking pledges and not keeping to them . not only that but she disappears to let other people pick up the pieces of their shattered lives . there  s also something that no one else has picked up upon and that is that the only character with any type of moral sense is former ira man andy bailey who is shown as being gallant not because he was a former ira member  that makes a change . we  re not talking about the devil  s own here  but simply because he is an atheist who has decided to think for himself  br    br   a love divided is a superb movie that has a lot to say for itself  all of which i agree with . if there  s any sort of criticism it  s that it feels too much like a tvm rather than a cinematic movie but believe me i can live with that and is essential viewing to anyone who thinks religion is the opium of the masses  ,1
i can  t believe i am just now seeing this film   i think perhaps i thought it was another movie about slaves being mistreated  and i avoided roots for the same reason   just as i have yet to see schindler  s list   i don  t want to be  entertained  by other peoples  pain  not matter how authentic or informative it is supposed to be .  br    br   so i guess the main thing i noticed about the color purple was that it was not about black people being mistreated by whites . the black people were perfectly capable of raping their own daughters   or giving them away to be treated as slaves by their  husbands  . it was painful to watch  but everyone redeemed himself in the end  and the acting was phenomenal  i couldn  t believe the character oprah played at the age of    and i adore whoopi to start with  she was amazing . i  m so glad i was feeling lousy yesterday afternoon and showtime was running the color purple .  ,1
an extra is called upon to play a general in a movie about the russian revolution . however  he is not any ordinary extra . he is serguis alexander  former commanding general of the russia armies who is now being forced to relive the same scene  which he suffered professional and personal tragedy in  to satisfy the director who was once a revolutionist in russia and was humiliated by alexander . it can now be the time for this broken man to finally  win  his penultimate battle . this is one powerful movie with meticulous direction by von sternberg  providing the greatest irony in alexander  s character in every way he can . jannings deserved his oscar for the role with a very moving performance playing the general at his peak and at his deepest valley . powell lends a sinister support as the revenge minded director and brent is perfect in her role with her face and movements showing so much expression as jannings  love . all around brilliance . rating    .  ,1
this is a movie of tired  yet weirdly childish  clichs . there  s a nazi witch master performing sf  related experiments in the basement  oh please   br    br   aiming for a creeping sense of horror and fear  the general impression of the film is that of a very immature conception of fright . not having any expectations beforehand  i am left with an aged xander from buffy and a heroine with ape  like face who doesn  t seem to know how to act . said adrienne barbeau have i only only encountered before in the much more enjoyable  cannibal women in the avocado jungle of death  .  br    br   camera and editing adds to the general impression of lame .  ,0

  baby face  is a precode melodrama starring a very young barbara stanwyck  an almost unrecognizable george brent  and theresa harris . it  s about a girl who goes to the city to make good . . . or should i say make time . stanwyck  s father has been pimping her for one reason or another her whole life in dingy  depressed  filthy erie  pennsylvania . after her father dies  one older father type who knows what she  s been through and truly cares about her future advises her to go to the big city and take advantage of opportunities there  and not the easy ones  and to take the high road in life .  note that i saw the censored version and not the uncut  this part of the film was redone for the censors .  she and chico  harris  go to new york where lily  nickname baby face  decides the low road  s a lot smoother and will get her where she wants to go a lot faster . in the movie  s most famous scene  the camera moves us up the corporate ladder by taking us from floor to floor as lily sleeps her way to the top . she finally corrals the big man himself and is able to quit her day job . trouble follows  and she  s soon involved in a huge scandal .  br    br   stanwyck wears lots of makeup and for most of the film is cool as a cucumber as she seduces one man after another with no regrets  and she  s great at playing the innocent victim . in one scene  she sits staring at a king  s ransom in jewels while wearing a black dress that looks like it  s decorated with diamonds at the top . then she asks chico for another case  and that  s filled with more jewelry  plus securities . all in a day  s work .  br    br   theresa harris was an interesting talent  she could be played down or glamorous  and was a talented singer and dancer as well . here  she sings or hums the movie  s theme   st . louis woman  throughout . she worked in literally dozens of movies and is very good here as a friend of stanwyck  s  her best work being in the precode era . as a bizarre byproduct of the code  blacks were often given less to do in films after it was put in place .  br    br   precode films could be more sexually blatant and therefore  though they  re    years old  seem more modern . even though these films didn  t have to have moral endings  baby face learns her lessons  how like life it is after all . there were several endings of this film  all with the same message . the one i saw had an added scene  but apparently  there were two other endings that didn  t pass the censors .  there wasn  t a code but there were always censors .  at any rate  it  s a neat surprise .  baby face  is an important film in movie history  a must see .  ,1

disappearance is set in the mojave desert as jim  harry hamlin   patty henley  susan dey  plus their two kids katie  basia a  hern   matt  jeremey lelliott  along with ethan  jamie croft  a friend of the family are travelling along  they stop at a roadside diner  ask about an old deserted mining town on the map called weaver . no  one claims to have heard of it but it  s definitely there  the family decide to take a detour in order to check it out  take some pictures . once at the town they take some pictures  have a look around but when it comes time to leave their car won  t start  they have to spend the night there . while looking around they find a camcorder videotape which they play only to discover footage of a scared woman saying all her friends have disappeared  the next morning  their car has disappeared as things take a very sinister turn . what is weaver  s secret  will the henley  s ever leave there alive . . .  br    br   written  co  executive produced  directed by walter klenhard i have to say that disappearance is one of the most frustrating films i have ever watched . for the first   minutes it was a pretty good mysterious mix of thriller  horror film but then we are treated to one of the single worst endings ever in motion picture history . the script suggest lots of different things but never elaborates or confirms  i was sitting there genuinely intrigued about what was going on  from the families car mysterious disappearing  the four recent graves  the thing in the abandoned mines  the supernatural sandstorm  the sudden  unexplained disappearance of ethan  his just as unexplained reappearance  the sheriff  s sinister motives  the compass in the car going crazy  the crashed plane  the townspeople denying weaver existed  the possible side effects of a neutron bomb being dropped near weaver in the    s but they are all tossed out of the window  for all we know could have been totally separate random events . everything was coming along nicely  was set up for a big twist revelation but none was forthcoming  instead i was treated to the most ambiguous  strange  surreal  downright frustrating ending possible . if nothing else the ending contradicts much of what has gone before  leaves the viewer with more questions than answers . it  s almost as if the makers had these great ideas but then didn  t know what to do with them  just made the ending up on the spot . i just felt i put so much effort into watching the film which can be pretty slow at times without any sort of reward  in fact the ending felt more like a kick in the teeth or a good two finger salute   br    br   director klenhard does a reasonable job here  the old ghost town has a certain atmosphere  the large expansive desert locations give a good sense of isolation . it  s well made but what were they thinking with that ending  nothing fits  nothing makes sense  it  s just a huge frustrating mess that after sitting through the thing for nearly an hour  a half leaves you confused  wanting to know more . despite being a horror film there  s no blood or gore although there are one or two creepy moments here  there . the film actually reminds of the hills have eyes       remake for large parts as that is what the film is set  up to be before a bizarre ending which does nothing to bring any closure to the film .  br    br   technically the film is good with high production values  good special effects  sets  locations  cinematography . set in america but filmed in south australia . the acting is fine from a decent cast .  br    br   disappearance is a really odd film  for a long time it shapes up to be a neat little horror mystery thriller but it never explains anything which happens  the truly surreal ending just throws up more questions than answers . i really can  t see anyone making head nor tail of this  i really can  t .  ,0

the appeal of ancient films like this one is that you get to see an actual moving image of life over    years ago . here are a lot of people leaving a factory  all of them dead by now and none of them even remotely aware of the magnitude of the invention that they are walking before . i was shocked to read one reviewer call this film as boring as home videos today  and at least one other mistakenly identified it as the first film ever made  it was the first film made at the rate of   frames per second  rather than the then  normal   frames per second  .  br    br   sure  all you see is a lot of people filing out of a building and passing before the cinematograph on their way home from work  but this is a curiosity piece for dozens of reasons  not the least of which is that it was the first film made by the lumire brothers  who probably had a stronger impact on the development of the cinema than any other individual or group of individuals in history .  ,1
home alone  is one of my least favourite movies . it  s the cream of the crop  or s if you tend to be more cynical  as it ranks up  or down  there with stuff like battlefield earth and flinstones viva rock vegas . in fact  it could even be worse than those two  since those two at least intermittently made me laugh at their stupidity . this just made me cringe in pain constantly and clap when the credits started rolling . no other movie has made me cringe in pain . now i will point out exactly why this movie is so incredibly atrocious .  br    br   first off  the plot is ridiculous . it revolves around a chip in a remote control car     that is misplaced and how these terrorists want it . dumb stuff .  br    br   the action that ensues is similar to that of the other two home alones  with boobytraps and all  but watching these boobytraps being executed is  rather than being funny  incredibly unpleasant to watch . i didn  t laugh  or even so much as smile  once  rather  i cringed constantly and hoped that the terrorists would nail the kid . the bird  rather than providing comic relief  was unfunny and annoying .  br    br   the acting  as done by a bunch of no names  ranges from poor to atrocious . there is not a single good performance here . alex d . linz is absolutely unlikeable and unfunny as the kid  while the terrorists act  and judging by their movie credits  look  as they  ve been hastily picked off the street . . . and well  that  s it .  br    br   i can see some people saying  man  it  s for the kids . don  t dis it  man .  well man  kids may like this  but they can get a hell of a lot better . see monsters inc . and toy story before even considering getting this out . hell  even scooby doo and garfield  which suck  see those reviews for more  are better than this   br    br   so in short  this is an irredeemably atrocious movie . this was clearly recycled for the money  as it almost completely rips off the first two the only thing is  it completely insults the first two as well . no human  kid or otherwise  should find any reason to see home alone  . ever . it  s that bad .  br    br      stars  ,0

after just   minutes into this film  i began to miss zhang yimou  s earlier  more weighty films that looked at the politics and society of china from unique perspectives . his turn to martial arts films was a serious misstep in my humble opinion . hero was his worst film since operation cougar  with a needlessly complex story and acting more wooden than that found in a john agar film . shi mian mai fu is no different . as an american who has been studying chinese films for a few years now  and understands and can speak some mandarin   i  m sure my opinion is different from many others as i  m coming from a different background . smmf  like hero  is not really a traditional a kung fu film  and it  s certainly not a wuxia pian film . there are no sword  sorcery or chivalry elements here . this is a completely different vehicle than infinitely more watchable films such as a chinese ghost story  all    the butterfly murders  green snake  et al . while those all featured charismatic leads who looked like they were actually enjoying what they do  smmf features bland  and sometimes laughable  dialogue combined with cardboard acting . zhang ziyi plays a blind person about as well as ben affleck . there  s an air of superiority with this film that  s really quite insulting . it takes itself so seriously  it just becomes a huge joke by the end . all the actors look as though this is the most important piece of celluloid in history  they destroy any chance of actually conveying emotions  and the complete humorlessness of it really makes you wonder if zhang yimou was making a film per se  or simply a showcase  i . e . an  ego booster   for zhang ziyi . the camera is literally making out with her face and she gets sexually assaulted not once but twice in the film . her acting range really hasn  t extended past her ability to play a naive  w  itch . she  s so concentrated on her acting  she comes across as cold and lifeless  as though she  s reading her lines from a notecard . it  s so funny to hear american critics and film people  like the completely clueless quentin tarantino  call this film a masterpiece . i guess if they see a bunch of asian actors on screen looking really important while flying through a bamboo forest  they  re tricked into thinking it  s brilliant film  making . ching siu tung  s choreography  while still retaining his trademark style  editing  and postures  lacks the vitality and originality of his earlier films like a chinese ghost story  dragon inn  and duel to the death . sadly to say  the wirework in this film is really subpar  and if there  s subpar  obvious wirework  then you probably shouldn  t have filmed it at high speed . the same goes for the special effects which have a distinct b  movie feel to them . beans  daggers  bowls  arrows  swords  and other random objects fly through the air  after being thrown  with no regard for logic  turning  climbing  and banking as though there  s a little pilot inside . i know that logic doesn  t really hold a place in stylized chinese martial arts films  but if you don  t want to induce a mass amount of giggling from your audience  then you should probably work on your compositing a bit more . mass melodrama  unintentionally funny dramatic moments  boring fight scenes  really uninspired plot twists are what await you with shi mian mai fu . it  s obvious that zhang yimou is no longer making movies for chinese audiences . this is meant to crack into the western market just as cthd did . after watching hero and smmf  i  ve come to the conclusion that if zhang yimou wants to make hollywood films  he  s definitely off to the right start . smmf is basically the phantom menace of chinese martial arts films . and i thought hero was bad .  ,0
i can catogoricaly and unequivocally say that in all my   years on this planet that is the worse  supposibly children  s  film i have ever seen in my life .  br    br   i took my three grand children to see it and even they were struggling to raise a smile during the all tortuous   mins . the sexual indendoes i will leave for another day but they were as tasteless as the film . they should pay you to watch it not you pay them . it  s truly truly awful  there is no other way to describe it . the people that made this film should be brought to task for taking money under false pretences .  br    br   aplogise for my spelling mistakes but i am so upset that it spoilt the time i had with my grandchildren regards  stephen  ,0
where to begin  how best to describe just how awful this movie is     br    br   let  s start with the campy hick humor . it isn  t very funny . add a bunch of musicians impersonating actors  meat loaf is horrible and deborah harry is even worse . pity poor art carney  who should have known better than to do this movie .  br    br   and then there is the plot . a roadie whose life goal is to work an alice cooper show meets a girl whose life goal is to be a groupie for alice cooper . at least they get what they want . . .  br    br   and then  just when the movie should end  they can  t come up with a more plausible last scene than a  well  i won  t ruin it for you if you really want to see the movie .  br    br   there are certain actors that let you know that this is going to be a  b  movie or perhaps worse . gailard sartain is one of them for me  and he has a more prominent role . that  s a sure sign that the movie probably won  t be very good . if nothing else  the movie lives up to the low expectations  even exceeds them by being worse than poor .  br    br   let  s just say this . this is the movie against which all bad movies are compared . and none are worse than roadie .  ,0
this movie is supposed to be a  lighthearted  tale about santa claus and his  magical and mystical  wonders . but instead it comes off as being downright creepy . two things in this movie that stand out in my mind as horrifying are   the way santa looks .  have you ever seen a more horrible looking santa claus  and   the  evil rep . of satan  pitch  s just plain odd dances are just sickening to watch . only watch this movie if it happens to be the msted version or if you like a very good laugh . i can  t believe this is a children  s movie .  ,0
this is a small film  few characters  theatrical . and yet it says something about ireland that you won  t find elsewhere . this film is ireland . in all it  s grubiness  it  s sadness  it  s self  delusion . the boys  master doyle  sp o  donell  the cannon  senator doogan  s daughter  gar and above all madge . i know them . i  m in the pub with them or kneeling to pray with them . they are our sad history and they are our present .  ,1
okay . as you can see this is one of my favorite if not favorite films . this is a character drama which is absolutely hilarious . the main character is a business man who is stuck in a  same thing  different day  mentality . he sees a woman looking melancholy out a window of a dance studio from his train everyday and wonders about her and decides to find out more about her . he decides to join the dance class only to find out she is not the instructor . from there he bonds with four other dancers and learns to enjoy dancing as well as finding out about the mysterious woman .  br    br   there is no gratuitous  or any  sex involved  just how a small group of people learn how friendships are formed and developed .  br    br   this film was remade with richard gere and jennifer lopez and the new one while appealing is nowhere as enjoyable as the original . the movie never made it big in america because it was not eligible for the oscars since it was broadcast on television in japan  movies cannot be released on tv or they are disqualified for oscar nominations  . it did win numerous awards in japan for best film  cast  director etc for their  oscar  awards .  ,1
the only aspect of this film that saves it from being my least favorite piece of celluloid trash is a single line uttered by an agent attempting to infiltrate the man  eating tomatoes by dressing in a tomato costume  can somebody please pass the ketchup   i highly urge anyone with a sleeping disorder to use this film as a sedative it works better than an overdose of demarol .  ,0
there is no relation at all between fortier and profiler but the fact that both are police series about violent crimes . profiler looks crispy  fortier looks classic . profiler plots are quite simple . fortier  s plot are far more complicated . . . fortier looks more like prime suspect  if we have to spot similarities . . . the main character is weak and weirdo  but have  clairvoyance  . people like to compare  to judge  to evaluate . how about just enjoying  funny thing too  people writing fortier looks american but  on the other hand  arguing they prefer american series      . maybe it  s the language  or the spirit  but i think this series is more english than american . by the way  the actors are really good and funny . the acting is not superficial at all . . .  ,1
i did not like the pretentious and overrated apocalypse now . probably my favorite vietnam war film is the deer hunter . the deer hunter focused on one part of the war  and then focused on the lives before the war . this movie is essentially deer hunter  . the script is too loose compared to the deer hunter . the story is never developed to the point that the audience can truly understand and feel for the characters like the deerhunter did . the vietnam flashbacks are not as gripping or involved as the ones in the deerhunter . this is why i can only give this movie  out of   .  br    br   however  i think that the acting was outstanding . deniro and harris are truly amazing actors . they totally immersed themselves in their characters and expressed the great anguish of two former friends who lost their best friend bobby in combat . harris  character is a half  dead alcoholic  who hides the guilt that he has in bobby losing his life trying to save his .  br    br   i also like the supporting cast . everyone in the town is part of the movie . the town obviously can  t handle vietnam vets very well . like many small towns  it is all about being quiet  humble  and minding one  s business . harris  character  however  can  t be any of these things . it is interesting how wars effect people . some people rebound quickly  while others never really recover .  ,1
this is one of the most hilariously bad movies i have ever had the privilege to see .  br    br   i watched this on dvd with a bunch of friends one friday night and we just couldn  t stop laughing from start to finish .  br    br   the story is simple enough terrorists hijack a convoy they think is carrying weapons grade uranium  but it  s actually carrying a bunch of man  eating dinosaurs . easy mistake to make . cue a startlingly incompetent team of army special forces to tackle the prehistoric beasts . they are led by colonel rance  played by scott valentine a man who seems to have perfected  smell the fart  acting  as advocated by joey in friends .  br    br   there  s plenty of gore and an awful lot of shooting  but unfortunately rance  s team seem to have a problem aiming their weapons in the general direction of a horde of giant  lumbering monsters . also  the lights always seem to flicker and go out whenever a velociraptor attacks  preumably so we can  t see how bad the creature effects are  .  br    br   having said all that  we all had a great deal of fun betting on who was going to get their head bitten off next .  br    br   as a jusassic park  aliens style action adventure this movie stinks worse than a dinosaur  s crotch  but as ludicrous  tongue  in  cheek entertainment it  s a roaring success .  ,0
the best thing i can say about this film is that it is well  paced . it did not fall flat . the next best things are the supporting performances by the actor playing foppish groom  to  be edward  the always marvelous holland taylor  and the actor playing taylor  s husband . the actor helping to critique messing  s potential outfits in an early scene brings a delightful absurd  yet  winning quality to the proceedings . okay  that  s about it on the positive side .  br    br   dermot mulroney  whom i adore  is far more believable expressing contempt for messing than in any scene where he  s attempting to be either businesslike or supporting . as others noted  he appears to have no emotional investment in this enterprise other than wrapping it up as quickly as possible . messing  on the other hand  sincerely tries to carry the film and to create the illusion of chemistry with mulroney . she is adequate doing so  but is simply not strong enough an actress to pull all of this off without help . give her an  e  for effort and a  c  for achievement . given mulroney  s indifference  the one thing that could  ve helped messing would have been a brilliantly cavalier irons  esquire performance from the actor playing her ex  fianc  jeffrey . instead  his performance is weak  kneed  mewling  and feckless .  br    br   if i tried to analyze this one any further  i  d obviously be paying more attention than most of the people involved . it  s harmless enough to pass time if you have nothing else to do  and less obnoxious  and less creative  than the wedding singer  but you  re much better off watching  my best friend  s wedding  again .  ,0
i know that actors and actresses like to try different kinds of movies  hey  no one wants to get typecast  but danny glover  brenda fricker  happy birthday  brenda   and christopher lloyd should have known better than this .  angels in the outfield  is another movie in which everything seems lost until someone or something magically comes and saves the day . do i even need to tell you how it ends  the movie is just plain lowly escapism  examples of high escapism are the various sci  fi movies from the    s  . if these movies had some political undertone  or at least offered us a new look at life  then they would be ok this one is just pointless . far closer to diabolical than angelic . also starring tony danza  adrien brody and matthew mcconaughey  and i suspect that they don  t wish to stress this in their resumes .  ,0
made in the same year as  vertigo   this is an equally bewitching movie  though in a much lighter vein . it  s set in an enchanted new york during the winter kim novak is a witch who casts a spell over james stewart  but gets caught in it instead . the interesting sidelight is that novak  s rival is played by janice rule  who originated the part of madge in  picnic  on broadway  the part that novak would make famous on film  .  ,1

when i saw the film for the first time in the early     s  i was in awe of this film . visually it was stunning and the events on campuses in europe and usa made you relate with what antonioni was trying to say so well visually in the final   minutes of the movie blowing up in your mind the  tyrannical  establishments and big business interests . the repeated blowing up of the beautiful house in the middle of a desert  the lead female character enjoying the natural stream of cold water  painting a plane in psychedelic designs  even the staid british airways did it a few years ago  are some of the images that were copied by advertising personnel all over the world for decades . even pink floyd increased their fan following after the film was released .  br    br   you see this film some   years later and you begin to wonder why the same film has lost its appeal . today anti  establishment films have more substance   facts  documentation  fine performances  and superb screenplays . antonioni seems to be out  of  date a flawed genius . even viewing antonioni  s  blow up  today gives you the similar feeling that he is passe .  br    br    zabriski point  has to be evaluated for what it was when it was released . it was a great film if you were to see it on a wide panavision screen as opposed to the dwarfed tv screens . the visual and aural  mick jagger  kieth richards  pink floyd  et al .  allure of the film still remains . the lead pair were not great actors but they were cute and natural . one of them  mark frechette  died in prison in usa extending the reality of the non  conformist values he personified in the film .  br    br   today  antonioni seems out of  sync .  but watch carefully and you will appreciate the muted sounds of the regular actors   rod taylor  g . d . spradling  the ladies at the swimming pool  the cops at the air  strip . the real sounds in contrast are from the non  conformists . antonioni was relevant   years ago but his grasp of the medium cannot be questioned even today . he knew what he was doing .  ,1
secret sunshine marks the return of director lee changdong to the film  making world after a multi  year absence . having three critically acclaimed films already under his belt  he recruits now veteran thespian jeon doyeon and her considerable  cannes  winning  talents for the primary role of lee shinae . what follows is a journey through one woman  s tragedy and an exploration of her coping mechanisms .  br    br   one of the things that becomes apparent while watching secret sunshine is that it doesn  t really care to follow any specific genre  but rather picks up genre traits when necessary to convey what it  s trying to convey . the story itself follows lee shinae as she moves with her son to the city of milyang  whose sino  corean translates to secret sunshine  . she moves to milyang in the aftermath of the death of her husband as it was his hometown  so the film is born from tragedy . and you think things might just get better as she opens up a piano shop and encounters a bit of a bumbling nice  guy mechanic jongchan  played by song kangho  . but this isn  t a romantic comedy .  br    br   as we  and jongchan  doggedly  follow shinae as she encounters milyang and the fate that it has in store for her  the cracks in her armor quickly become apparent . she is a troubled woman trying to grasp onto her own strength to overcome tragedy and we watch as she finds that it  s not enough . secret sunshine still manages to follow a mostly aristotelian dramatic arc  but pulls back on the catharsis  which might confound some viewers  especially the ending  but the novelistic symbolism present in the name of milyang  the discussions of sunshine and the imagery used in the film very well left me satisfied  once i started to think over the film some more .  br    br   ms . jeon is rather impressive throughout  especially considering that if the role were any less well played  it would  ve quickly turned into a rather painful melodrama  but she captures the nuances of shinae  s attempts to deal with her losses with a layer of subtlety . mr . song has a much smaller role in this film than other films  but he performs adequately  appropriately giving stage to ms . jeon . technically  the film is well done in a classical sense . no flashy aesthetics are employed here   the director is clearly trying to let the story tell itself . i think my only real complaint  and one that might not be able to be fixed  is that despite all the time we spend with shinae  there is a bit of distance between shinae and the audience  or at least  me  . i think some of this stems from the nature of the work  because if total empathy were pushed  then we wouldn  t be able to see the problems that shinae has objectively . on the other hand  i never felt moved along with shinae  s plight  despite her many tears and increasingly erratic behavior .  br    br   all the same  the film still stands quite impressive  especially in that it stimulated me to think about it  the further meanings present in it and its ruminations on tragedy  coping  self  deception  isolation and faith stuck with me well after the credits had finished running . propelled by a strong lead performance  i honestly didn  t notice its  .   hour runtime . and that says something . well done .     .  ,1
how this has not become a cult film i do not know . i think it has been sadly overlooked as a truly ingenious comedy   br    br    runaway car  attempts to pass itself off as a fast  paced thriller  but taking the quality of acting  good god it  s bad   the storyline  the practicalities of the car  s demonic possession and the baby evacuation scene into account there is nothing you can really do but laugh . and laugh you will . films are made to entertain us  and the degree to which they do this can be an indication of a film  s worth . this film is the pinnacle in entertainment  i laughed from beginning to end . at one point i got short of breath and nearly choked  it really is that funny at some points . when the baby was airlifted out of the sunroof in a holdall by a helicopter with a robot pilot who managed to maintain a constant velocity identical to the car and a perfectly flat flight plain that meant the grapple hook didn  t rip the car roof to pieces  i was laughing hysterically . but when the baby starting swinging around in the air  nearly hit a bridge and almost got tangled up in a tree  tears were running down my face .  br    br   it also occurred to me that the black cop was the guy who played jesus in madonna  s  like a prayer  video . he seems to get everywhere .  ,1

i found this film to be quite an oddity . from the very get go i found it extremely hard to like this movie  and now after a little thinking about it i can pretty much pinpoint the reason why . jean  marc barr  although i love him to bits  i think zentropa is one of the best movies ever made  is quite miscast here  and although i can  t figure for the life of me who would be better  i am sure someone could have taken his place quite easily and make this film work . everything else is fine  except for the stabs at weak comedy  a meet the parents joke is not really needed  filmmakers   and i really like richard e . grant as the british major . it just suffers from one thing . . jean  marc .  ,0
i don  t know what the oscar voters saw in this movie  but they must of seen some pretty hard stuff to see in it to be able to award it with the best picture oscar . all i know is that fortunately there was gene kelly to play in it or this would have been twice as bad as i believe it is . first of all  i don  t think leslie caron was really fit to play such a role . she isn  t that talented  she isn  t a great dancer and she  s not good looking at all . it  s a shame that one actor or actress may ruin a movie just like by playing in it because if leslie caron hadn  t been in this  it might have made a terrific movie . the story was intelligent  the directing wasn  t bad  and  as i said  gene kelly was pretty good . now i  m not saying all this stuff about leslie caron just to criticize her  i  m just saying it because i think that  s what the worse part of the movie is . she  s probably a good actress but i can  t tell because i haven  t seen her in anything else but i think she was pretty bad in  an american in paris  . so if you want to see it  go ahead but i  m telling you  you  re way better off watching  singin  in the rain  .  ,0
this is a haunting  powerful italian adaptation of james m . cain  s novel the postman always rings twice directed by the great luchino visconti . what is so interesting about the film is that in every way it transcends it  s source material to become something bolder and more original  interestingly camus also credits cain  s novel as the key inspiration for his landmark novel the stranger  . the film has a greater power and intensity than the novel because visconti is able to create the filmic equivalent of cain  s narrative structure but offer a more complex exploration of gender . cain  s very american novel is also uncritically fascinated with the construction of whiteness  the lead character cora is obsessively afraid she will be identified as a mexican and embarrassed that she married a greek immigrant   which is not relevant to the italian rural context that visconti is working in . this allows the class antagonisms to take center stage and dance among the embers of the passionate  doomed love affair of the two main characters . this film is a complex  suspenseful  rewarding experience .  ,1
a series of painfully unfunny skits that seem to go on forever and a day . not as mind  numbingly awful as say  freddy got fingered  or  lost reality   but that in no way is an endorsement in any way  sense or form . features the worst rhyming clown ever . any most if it isn  t offensive to anybody but the most prudish or politically correct . it also has the worst song parody ever put on film  the worst arnold impersonation ever  not just the worst put on film  literally the worst ever  . i have no clue why karen black  micheal clarke duncan  or slash would star in this  the reasons i watched this in the first place  the only thing mildly amusing was dickman . in conclusion i would  t recommend this film to anyone  but the people who are making it their mission in life to get this in the bottom    on this site are pathetic . do something notable with you lives people . plus if it  s true the church of scientalogy hates him  he can  t be all bad .  br    br   my grade d  ,0
this film uses all art  house clichs  slow pace  long static shots  minimal amount of dialog  to try to hide the fact that there really is nothing worth watching here there is no plot to speak of  the characters are dreary  female lead  or clich  tersteeghe  s character   and they do not ever talk to each other about anything that concerns their rather uneventful lives . the film is centered around a woman who finds out about her husbands adultery . instead of confronting him  she half  heartedly takes revenge by committing adultery herself . after a fight and a reconciliation with her sister  who knew about the adultery without telling her  she asks her husband to stop cheating on her . they seem to be re  united as a family . two other story lines  the planned move of the woman  s elderly father with his young wife to guernsey and the rivalry with the woman  s sister  do not offer any interesting developments . the suicide of a colleague of the woman that seems to set off events in the film is not a subject in itself . for      or any other year for that matter  this is not enough to make an interesting film .  br    br   moreover  what little possibilities for dramatic development there are in the script are not used or are consciously avoided  as when both the woman and her sister mark a particular piece of furniture from their fathers house which is going to be sold because of his planned move . both sisters want this particular piece and given their rivalry in the past  over much more important things than furniture men  this could in theory lead to a confrontation . or the matter could be resolved by one sister giving way to the other . either way  this would not be a very interesting or original development of the story but at least it would constitute some development . the film clearly sets this situation up  with both sisters looking intently at each other during the marking and one sister having mentioned she does not want to draw straws  but it cheats us out of any resolution the scene simply ends and how this  in itself rather dreary and materialistic  issue is solved  is not shown .  br    br   although almost completely absent  the dialog that is in the film is excruciatingly flat and tepid . for example  when during a visit to guernsey  the  sisters address their rivalry it is in a three line dialog that has a childish  yes it is  no it isn  t  ring to it . the fight and reconciliation scene with the  sisters is completely without dialog  giving a highly artificial  overly stylised and unrealistic impression and considerably reducing its impact . the way the woman finally  finally   addresses her husbands adultery in a single line of dialog has to be seen to be believed  and is at the same time completely unbelievable . the husband does not seem to have any noticeable reaction or if he has any  it is not shown . the woman does not mention her own adultery to her husband . the scene showing the woman  husband and their young son asleep on an airliner  watched by the sister is possibly meant as a happy end  but the way the characters addressed the issues of their lives in what went before makes this unlikely .  br    br   because of its slow pace  uninteresting story  leaden direction and absurd lack of dialog  i found this film an example of everything that can be wrong with an art  house movie and a complete waste of time .  ,0
i agree with what  veinbreaker  wrote with regards to the  ahhhh  feeling you get at the end of this movie . i absolutely loved the locations they chose to film  the songs were well written and interesting  especially the psychedelic sounding track on which hans matheson sings . it  s trippy . nighy was fab in his role  nail  nailed  it  beano was the typical drummer  and rea kept it together . bruce robinson was awesome . helena was a lovely girlfriend . but i felt juliet aubrey  s performance was gorgeous . the scenes between aubrey  robinson killed me  perfectly played and the music behind the scene was spot on  too bad not many more musicians have checked this movie out  they ought to  i  ve told all my musician friends . great quote by jimmy nail  s character  it  s supposed to be rock  roll  not the phantom of the fg opera    ,1
police story is arguably one of the best works by the master of action himself . compared to other action films  police story makes schwarzenegger and stallone look like beginners . the stunt scenes are well cheorgraphed and the action scenes are superb . if new line cinema has any sense  they would release this in theaters .  ,1
oh dear  what a horrid movie .  br    br   the production was so cheap and nasty . . . remember the shot from  the natural   where the lightning hits the tree  leaving a glowing stump  that roy hobbs makes a bat from   well the producers of this movie used that same scene to prefix a scene where a tree branch slammed into the house .  br    br   i wonder if they paid to use the footage from the natural  or did they just hope that no  one who would watch the film would pick it up   br    br   then at the end where they were getting trying to get away in the truck . such over  acting in the cabin .  br    br   a really bad film  a really bad film .  ,0
literally every aspect of this science  fiction low  budget flick falls under the categories that have been classified for its predecessors  contemporaries  and those to follow . bad special effects  a weak storyline  ridiculous amounts of blood and gore  annoying and pointless characters  all that you can expect .  attack of the sabretooth  is about a new vacation resort where the proprietors are genetically engineering smilodon cats for an attraction . the cats escape and begin to kill people  the guy running the show wants to save them and not warn the unsuspecting visitors about them  and there is a band of visitors and some employees who rebel and plan to kill the cats .  br    br   special effects  wise  the film is about an average achievement given its budget . the sabretooths are portrayed through poor cgi . amazingly  though  the cats look more realistic in an up  close  detailed shot rather than the longer  more distant shots where the cgi is better concealed . their attacks are recklessly bloody and distasteful . just as you  d expect  they attack  rip off some arms and legs  and leave very little behind . this is part of the reason why the film descends into poor schlock .  br    br   the plot and characters are just as horrendous . we have some college kids who come to the island and they plan a scavenger hunt . and take it very  very seriously . even so much as to trespass on private property  tamper with security systems  and steal . why are they taking a simple game so seriously  did i miss something  was there money involved  or were they sent to do it  i don  t know  i could barely follow the film . but it seemed to me like they were just doing it for the fun of doing it . even so  they went too far for normal .  br    br    attack of the sabretooth  is a very poor film . even for a low  budget sci  fi flick  it is a very poor and cheap example . it will bore most viewers to tears  might be attractive for some  and will make you chuckle and laugh all the way through . and keep in mind  this is not a comedy  this is a cheap horror flick  so it  s not suppose to be comical .  ,0
i found  the arab conspiracy  in a bargain bin and thought i  d uncovered a lost treasure . folks  there  s a reason why you don  t hear much about this film . the plot is muddy  the pacing is slow  cornelia sharpe is about as vivacious as plain  cold tofu  and the ending leaves you flat . not even sean connery can save this one .  ,0
from the beginning this movie did have a few flaws . the main character played by hayden christensen is a the rich young mogul who has inherited his father  s considerable wealth and power  and he is struggling to both fill his father  s shoes and cut the apron strings mother  and co  executive  keeps too tight . he also has the problem of having a heart condition and waiting in the limbo that is the organ donor registry . there are also minor back stories which your first instinct is to mostly ignore that become important later  such as his friendship with his surgeon  terrence howard  and his romance with a middle class girl  jessica alba  . uncreative story lines  but not bad enough to ruin the movie . the only real  oy vey   moment was the name of lena olin  s character . overbearing woman named lilith . . . subtle   br    br   the surgical scenes are not at all censored . i appreciated that  people who find surgery scenes scary might not . the horror of being awake during anesthesia was done well at first . you watch in emotional agony as christensen screams inwardly through the chest incision and the rib spreader . the moment of irony from the trailers then comes where while he is one of the unlucky few to be awake during anesthesia  he is also luck in that it helps him learn that his surgical team is planning to murder him .  br    br   the big twist  however  is very predictable and sends the film delving into the conspiracy and his memories of the little signs which were there but he  like us  initially missed .  br    br   there are two more twists at the end involving his relationship with his mother . one is an impressive gesture by olin  which comes of as unimpressive due to poor writing . the other is a secret about the family  s past which seemed very tacked on and pointless .  br    br   the initially well done anesthesia awareness drama gets lost in the poorly written conspiracy drama . there is a one final attempt to bring it back which falls flat  taking the entire movie with it .  ,0
oh dear lord . this movie . . . it was horrible . i am a huge fan of horror movies . and most of the time  horror movies other people say are bad  i like . the actor who played  scarecrow  was amazing  i will say that . but this plot was awful . it made no sense  it had way too much gore  and an unnecessary  and revolting  sex scene at the beginning . i do believe the director was trying to be  shocking  or whatnot  but it just came out awful . to add to the pile of festering crap they called a plot  the actors  besides  scarecrow   we  re awful  and i cared so little about them that i soon forgot who was who . in conclusion  this movie made me sick . if you can avoid watching this movie in anyway  please do .  ,0
there seems to be an overwhelming response to this movie yet no one with the insight to critique its methodology  which is extremely flawed . it simply continues to propogate journalistic style analysis  which is that it plays off of the audiences lack of knowledge and prejudice in order to evoke an emotional decry and outburst of negative diatribe .  br    br   journalism     tell the viewer some fact only in order to predispose them into drawing conclusions which are predictable . for instance  the idea of civil war  chaos  looting  etc were all supposedly unexpected responses to the collapse of governmental infrastructure following hussein  s demise were these not all symptomatic of an already destitute culture  doctrinal infighting as symptomatic of these veins of islam itself  rather than a failure in police force to restrain and secure  would they rather the us have declared marshall law  i  m sure the papers here would  ve exploded with accusations of a police state and fascist force .  br    br   aside from the analytical idiocy of the film  it takes a few sideliners and leaves the rest out claiming  so  and  so refused to be interviewed . . .  yet the questions they would  ve asked are no doubt already answered by the hundred inquisitions those individuals have already received . would you  as vice president  deign to be interviewed by a first time writer  producer which was most certainly already amped to twist your words . they couldn  t roll tape of condi to actually show her opinion and answer some of the logistics of the questions  perhaps they never watched her hearing .  br    br   this is far from a neutral glimpse of the situation on the ground there . this is another biased  asinine approach by journalists  which are  by and large  unthinking herds .  br    br   anyone wanting to comment on war ought at least have based their ideas on things a little more reliable than nbc coverage and cnn commentary . these interpretations smack of the same vitriol which simply creates a further bipartisanism of those who want to think and those who want to be told by the media what to think .  ,0
i was absolutely blown away by john cassavetes  s opening night . it  s the first movie of his that i  ve seen that seems to be on a bigger scale  thus it feels more mainstream  but it still doesn  t feel as if he grounded himself any more than he has in his previous films . that is perhaps what makes it so intense . there is also something undoubtedly cathartic about watching this movie .  br    br   it  s about what in fact cassavetes has made a staple of his career  an ideal that he has expressed behind the camera throughout his career as a director and is here expressing it in front . rowlands  s character  middle  aged stage actress myrtle gordon  cannot bring herself to play her role in the upcoming production as written so she uncalculatedly follows impulse after impulse  resulting in what appears to be chaos on stage  until she finds the right one . it  s a daringly abstract premise .  br    br   this is a movie that does not fail to capture the innate steering that one goes through during an emotional cleansing . no one understands why myrtle does many of the things she does  and it is seen and even portrayed as something destructive  yet it just might be the best thing for her . it may be a cleansing rather than a breakdown . a withdrawal  a cocoon  a rebellion  it all culminates into a meltdown . cassavetes gives her character a brutally real touch  which is that early on  she is ardently arguing that she has nothing in common with her character  yet she is in quiet but emotionally corroding fear that the opposite is true .  br    br   the last scene  the climactic performance that myrtle shares with a character painfully estranged from her who is acting with her  is one of the most interesting  hilarious  hard  hitting  enlightening  and enjoyable moments i  ve ever seen in a movie .  ,1
this is my favorite jackie chan movie and in an interview  jackie said it was his favorite as well . it contains some unbelievable stunts and jaw dropping fight sequences as well as some very funny scenes as well . this movie was a favorite of brandon lee  who used parts in rapid fire  and was also lifted in tango and cash  which used some of the opening scenes .  br    br   jackie plays a policeman in hong kong . the story immediately jumps into a fantastic chase through a shanty town and continues as jackie slides down a hill and jumps onto a moving bus to catch the evil ku  who is one of the greatest villains in any jackie chan movie .  you can expect some very funny scenes as jackie tries to balance his duty as a policeman with his girl friend  played by maggie chung . his job is to protect ku  s secretary who has enough information to take him down  but even that poses many problems . jackie is at his absolute best here . the last fight scene at the mall is my favorite fight scene by anyone  period . it was the most intense fight i have ever seen jackie do and climaxes in a slide down a pole amidst exploding lights . all in all  one of his greatest stunts he ever did and left him with skin pealed off his hands . he was fortunate he was not electrocuted as the person in charge of the stunt used high voltage instead of a lower voltage .  br    br   all in all  another chan classic and definitely one of his greatest movies . by the end of this movie  you can tell he held absolutely nothing back and neither did his stuntmen . so many of his stuntmen were injured during this movie that nobody would insure them anymore  jackie had to take responsibility himself . there are no gimmicks  wires or stand  ins  it is all true  life action that is a treat to watch . it is this type of action that made him the phenomenon that he is and it is a movie that will amaze people    years from now . if you have not seen this movie and are a fan of jackie chan or action in general  give yourself a treat and watch this movie . it is truly sensational .  ,1
being that i loved the original  caligula  even with all its flaws  i have to say this remake trailer was abysmal .  br    br   listening to jovovich say in that lazy american accent  mmm cuhligyooluh . . .  makes me feel sick . the set doesn  t look roman at all . . . it looks like some rich actor  s hollywood mansion backyard  and the roman costumes look like cheap crap you buy at a suburban costume shop .  br    br   that  charming  adriana asti looks like a fifty year old hispanic woman totally terrified out of her mind  as if not knowing it  s a movie trailer .  br    br   the acting has got to be some of the worst i  ve ever seen  with most of the lines i hear being random actors screaming  caligulaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa          as loudly and obnoxiously annoyingly as they can .  br    br   the random sex scenes also filled a good   or    of the trailer  and the scenes with notable actors  actresses like gerard butler  who graces the screen in shadows for all of three and a half seconds  not doing anything but looking uncomfortable or going all  out over the top with their minimal lines  just dragging it down with the ridiculousness of their delivery .  br    br   courtney love  s part consists of her looking like her usual dumpy crack  whore self leaning against a door mumbling about the moon or something . you can  t tell because she  s either drunk or high or just mumbling idiotically .  br    br   karen black is just annoying . . . randomly laughing  and screaming in such a way that irritates you .  br    br   helen mirren . . . she was in the original  and her return to  caligula  consists of . . .  caaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaligulaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa                i particularly  love   and by love  i mean hate  ennia  s line   caligola . . . j   no maki me something incoherent . . . . something that sounds like j   nalo  it  s also insanely arrogant to say caligula  s four year reign was greater than jesus  s birth and death .  br    br   honestly  this has got to be the worst  most exploitative  self  indulgently arrogant piece of crap labeled as  art  i  ve ever seen . even if gore vidal hated the original caligula  he shouldn  t have shown up or given his name over for this crap  pile  no matter how much they paid him  unless it was a billion trillion yen  . worst trailer ever .  ,0
i remember when i first saw this short  i was really laughing so hard  that like with a lot of other films that i have seen  no sound came out  curly is really great at  singing  opera in this one  i am surprised that he did not consider a career as a professional singer  because he was really good   br    br   if you noticed  this was filmed near the end of curly  s career as a stooge  you could really tell he had changed  because he had lost weight and was thinner  his voice was deepening  his face was getting lined with wrinkles  though he still could pull it off  he looked like he was fifty at the age of forty . this was because he was suffering many minor strokes before his big one that ended his career . be he still managed to pull it off in his last ones   br    br   if you don  t mind the fact that curly was really getting very ill at this point  this is actually one of their funniest shorts . i know that i didn  t mind the fact that curly was really changing  because i still thought that he was great   br    br         ,1
what boob at mgm thought it would be a good idea to place the studly clark gable in the role of a salvation army worker   ironically enough  another handsome future star  cary grant  also played a salvation army guy just two years later in the highly overrated she done him wrong . i guess in hindsight it  s pretty easy to see the folly of these roles  but i still wonder who thought that salvation army guys are  hot  and who could look at these dashing men and see them as realistic representations of the parts they played . a long time ago  i used to work for a sister organization of the salvation army  the volunteers of america  and i never saw any studly guys working there  and that includes me  unfortunately  . maybe i should have gotten a job with the salvation army instead   br    br   so  for the extremely curious  this is a good film to look out for  but for everyone else  it  s poor writing  sloppy dialog and annoying moralizing make for a very slow film .  ,0
part ii or formerly known as guerilla  is also a great achievement but not quite as entertaining as part i because this is where we begin to witness what might have caused the fall and death of che guevara . once again  i  m impressed by the cause  and  effect that both parts have in their interconnecting stories . we  re reminded again and again that the lead character  che guevara is an argentine . some of the men in fidel  s army chose not to take orders from a foreigner and now that che has chosen to leave the comfort of victory to continue the revolutionary in bolivia  he doesn  t get much respect from his new army and the natives either  only because he  s a foreigner .  br    br   as far as technical goes  i think part ii would  ve been more helpful if before everything else  right after the display of the map  it would show some highlights from the previous installment just to refresh memory about his characters and what he  s set himself on doing  to make the audience understand why his methods was successful in cuba but they don  t work in bolivia . it is clear now in this segment  that che is not as charismatic as fidel castro . in bolivia  he  s dealing with a bunch of soldiers whose hearts are not fully in it . it  s said that the ingredient for revolutionary is love . . well  they don  t give a damn that much about their country so it  s a tough sell . it  s excruciatingly painful and difficult for che to get the others to buy into his vision .  br    br   i like one particular scene that illustrates che  s deteriorating condition  a scene in which his horse would not go no matter how badly che tries to direct it  and then his temper took the better of him and for a moment there  he forgets he  s a doctor  and he becomes this desperate soldier who  s stabs his own horse . his army is like a horse that doesn  t want to be led . but at the same time  the film drags  it relies on small cameos from familiar faces that you  ll recognize just for the sake of brief entertainment and for the most part  you get pounded left and right by one obstacle after another  but maybe that is the intention of part ii  if so . . then it definitely works . standing ovation to the cinematography that gives us a first person view at the moment of che  s last breath . this movie may not answer the questions of why che guevara was so stubborn  why he was so determined he could pull it off even wen the odds were against him and why he deeply wants south america to have the same fate as cuba but the movie che is a story worth telling .  ,1
when seeing this movie you should take notice to that its not a normal movie . it has no real story just characters  a bunch of gangster characters who come together in a perfect harmony . the dialogue is wonderful  you can just lay back and listen . the movie stands out thats why its hard to find a right way of describing it .  br    br   thats why the user comments on this movie is so mixed .  br    br   i for one love the movie and recommend it to all who love one  liners and things that differ from the  normal  . you cant really put the finger on whats so wonderful about it its just a comical world where gangsters rule . a place of love and danger . a movie that you can see more than one time .  ,1
gandhi  the great   br    br   greatness in the world is associated with people like alexanader the great  ashoka the great for their greatness lied in being glorified as more than humans . gandhi is called great for actually not being a great but being more human  for i always believe bringing out the humanity in us is where the greatness of being human lies . gandhi was a human with humanity and one who strived for humanity ready to sacrifice himself in the battle for humanity but not his enemies . let me move to the movie review now .  br    br   about gandhi my father   br    br   gandhi my father is a film not about gandhi but about his son harilal gandhi . on telling the story of a son whose father was one of the greatest humans to walk this earth  the director succeeds in portraying the tale . the film succeeds in telling the story of a mislead son of a father who lead a nation to greatness . the movie is termed as a criticism of gandhi  s failure as a father to his son  i would rather say it is of a sacrifice gandhi had made as a father of a son to do justice as a father of a nation .  br    br   i wish the essence of this movie prevails not just in india  the gandhian land  but through the hearts of all the people of this world .  br    br   gandhi the true human . jaihind .  ,1
this is by far the worst adaptation of jane eyre i have seen . it is uncertain whether or not the writer of the screenplay ever read the book by bronte . george c scott is ridiculous and bumbling as rochester   when not just plain old acting angry . susannah york has the most dated      s hairstyle i have ever seen in a victorian movie . the characters hardly speak to each other  so the rich banter enjoyed in the book that is the basis for their deep intellectual and abiding love  is gone . the ending is ludicrous .  br    br   please  rent the timothy dalton version instead . it is so true to the book  it  s like having the novel read aloud to you . dalton is superb as rochester . g . c . scott is laughable .  ,0
as did others in this forum  when  fobidden planet  was offered in      i rushed to see it . this story is an interesting phenomenon i suggest because young  old  male  female  sci  fi experts and people who find such fare  way out  all can follow and enjoy this film  s story and plot lines very well . this is the first movie set on a planet other than earth in the   th century other than serials such as  flash gordon  . leslie nielsen was vocally a bit weak for his role  at that time  but walter pigeon  marvin miller  anne francis  richard anderson  earl holliman and especially warren stevens all acquitted themselves very well . there are so many visual splendors in this one  it  s hard to choose a favorite from the film  s scenes . the approach to altair    the starship itself  the landing on the planet  s alien surface  the descent via extensor stairs  the first view of the landscape  the approach of the rocket  sled  dr . morbius  s house seen from without and from within  the underground complex and its wonders  the setup of the weaponry  the battle with the monster  the final approach of the unseen destroyer  the escape from the doomed planet   all these scenes are etched into the viewer  s mind because we discover them along with the participants . veteran cyril hume  s literate script was filmed intelligently by long  time director fred mcleod wilcox with clarity and imagination . it is a shock to realize there  s no music at all the film is carried by the words  the actors and the mystery  revelation storyline . it can be watched again and again with pleasure   i have been doing so for nearly fifty years . until this famous and well  loved film was created  no film had tried to imagine a world beyond earth and for decades afterward  ships kept crashing back on the planet   as if the writers  imaginations were failing and causing the crashes . still the best  many say . that says something negative about this nation  s so  called intellectual leaders  imaginations   and something very positive indeed i suggest about those who made this gem .  ,1
  very light spoilers  maybe .   br    br   normally a fan of diane keaton  i tried to watch this tonight . i had to switch it off before the second hour because i found myself with absolutely no sympathy for daughter or mother . both came across as self  absorbed with little regard for others  with the daughter also adding in rude  disrespectful and reckless to the mix . when the daughter died  the only thing i thought was   at least we won  t have to watch her anymore .  keaton did a good job of moving into her stunned state and into the grieving  but it was too far gone for me by then . i simply wasn  t enjoying it  so i stopped watching . if you want me to care for the protagonist  you need to get me caring about the characters much sooner   if it  s nearly an hour in and i don  t care  it  s too late .  br    br   the supporting cast was sincere and well played   i felt for them     and the gay best friend was wonderful  but even combined  that wasn  t enough to carry the film for me .  ,0
i have not read the other comments on the film  but judging from the average rating i can see that they are unlikely to be very complementary .  br    br   i watched it for the second time with my children . they absolutely loved it . true  it did not have the adults rolling around the floor  but the sound of the children  s enjoyment made it seem so .  br    br   it is a true mel brooks farce  with plenty of moral content  how sad it is to be loved for our money  not for whom we are  and how fickle are our friends and associates . there are many other films on a similar subject matter  no doubt  many of which will have a greater comic or emotional impact on adults . it  s hard for me to imagine such an impact on the junior members of the family  however .  br    br   hence  for the children  a     from me .  ,1
this sure is one comedy i  m not likely to forget for a while .  br    br   wouldn  t normally bother to comment on this movie it  s so minor that no one would watch it anyway  but as it happens  it  s kind of popular in p  p sharing networks such as kazaa  and so this saaad production needs to be exposed for what it is .  br    br   so what is it then  well  of course it  s not really a comedy instead  it  s intended as a horror flick    intended  very much being the key word here . the script is a totally incoherent and unbalanced mess  the special effects are only special in that they  re especially pathetic  and as for the acting  well  let  s just say that if this had been my graduating play at primary school  my teachers would have burst out crying at our talent .  br    br   of course i realise that this is a very low budget film and that in those cases one should lower one  s expectations  certainly as far as things like special effects are concerned . also  even though i  m a big fan of the horror genre  i  m aware that these movies are only rarely the places to look for interesting scripts and top notch acting .  br    br   but still .  br    br   b  movies often have some redeeming features to make up for the lack of funding  such as humour . the only laughs in cradle to fear lie in the ridiculous performances . if you can find the humour in that   and i could for the first   minutes or so  gradually dozing off after that   then that  s going to be the only thing the movie has to offer . oh  that and two or three pairs of breasts .  br    br   woohoo  how exciting .  br    br   as for the story  it  s not even that it doesn  t try to convey anything the victims either use drugs and  or are involved in serious crime . the lesson watch out  naughty boys and girls  because one day you  ll be made to pay for what you  ve done .  br    br   i rest my case .  br    br   so  all in all  a little bit of sex  a fair amount of drugs  but absolutely zero rock  n roll .  br    br   i rate this one  out of    but would go to  if i could . or perhaps i wouldn  t it deserves a  for spelling the actors  names correctly in the titles . i mean  that  s something  innit   ,0
after dark  my sweet is a great  modern noir  filled with seedy characters  dirt roads  and  of course  sweaty characters . it seems that most of the truly great noirs of the last two or three decades have taken place in the south  where the men glisten and the ladies  um  glisten too . why  because it  s hooooottttttttttt . and because everyone looks better wet  at least the men do  sweaty women leave me clammy  .  br    br   anyway  there might be some spoilers in here .  br    br   this film is a wonderful example of everything a noir should be  steady pacing  though some with attention disorders refer to it as  slow    clearly and broadly drawn  though not simple  characters  and tons of atmosphere . noir  if anything  is about moods and attitudes . that  s why the great ones are not marked by your traditional definitions of  great  acting  look at bogart  mitchum  hurt  and nicholson  they  and their characters  were anything but real  but they had style and sass and in a crime movie that  s exactly what you want  . or quickly paced adventures  again all great noirs seem to be on slow burn like a cigarette  . great noirs create an environment and you just inhabit it with the characters for a couple hours .  br    br   after dark my sweet let  s you do that  and it let  s you enjoy the company of some very interesting and complex characters . uncle bud and collie are intriguing  never allowing the audience to know what really makes them tick  and patric and dern  i love bruce dern  by the way  are pitch perfect  dern especially  see previous comment  . they take the basic outlines of a character and give them depth and elicit our sympathies .  br    br   the story itself is also interesting . there  re better plots in the world of noir  hardly any mystery here  mostly it  s suspense   but this one is solid . if anything  the simply  okay  plot has more to do with jim thompson  s writing than anything else . with thompson  plots are almost secondary he eschewed the labyrinthine tales of hammett and chandler for simpler stories with stronger  more confusing characters . look at a novel like the killer inside me and and you  ll see right away  from the title  what it  s all about . when it comes to thompson  it  s not what it  s about  it  s how it  s about it  to quote roger ebert  . so  really  the relatively simple plot of a kidnapping is not the point and  if you don  t like it  well the jokes on you .  br    br   why this is an  star movie rather than a   star one is because of the female lead . she  s not bad  per se  but she  s not angelica huston or anette benning  see the adaptation of jim thompson  s the grifters if you don  t know what i  m talking about  besides it  s a better movie and you should start there for contemporary noir  it  s the best of the     s and challenges blood simple for the title of best since chinatown  . she simply doesn  t have the chops  or the looks for that matter  and though she and patric have some chemistry  i don  t have it with her . so there .  ,1
this is the only movie i have ever seen that has prompted me to write a critique on any internet site  and that is a significant statement from someone who likes  the attack of the monolith monsters .  this movie is perfect for anyone who wants an inoffensive movie . it is devoid of sex and violence  for example . i believe that this movie is safe for children of all ages . this movie is perfect for anyone who does not want to be entertained  challenged  or stimulated in any way . adults could easily catch up on their sleep in front of the tv while the kids watch this movie . don  t be surprise  however  if you wakeup to find the kids have turned the tv off and started a board game . as an adult who enjoys being entertained  who enjoys everything from the mundane to the fantastic in realism  drama  comedy  and action  all of those adult things that reflect real life on earth and  or stimulate the imagination  this movie has nothing to offer .  ,0
i thought it was one of the best sequels i have seen in a while . sometimes i felt as though i would just want someone to die  stanley  s killing off of the annoying characters was brilliant . it was such a well done movie that you were happy when so and so died . my only problem was in some scenes it looked like someone with a home camera was filming it and it was weird . judd nelson is cute  at least in my opinion and he was excellent in the role as stanley caldwell . brilliant movie .  ,1
i am a big fan of the movie  but not for the usual reasons . i think travolta and winger performed at higher than average rates  i think the sets were representative of the location and the era  i liked the sound track and the charlie daniels band . however  i think the photography was amazing  since the interior scenes were filmed in the actual club and gilley  s had low ceilings   perhaps      feet high and the smoke that was supposed to simulate a  smoke  filled bar  hung    feet below the ceiling . the camera managed to get shots through the smoke and focus on the actors  the bull  the bar  the women  the dancing  the low  level of light that actually was in the bar  what a feat  sure there was auxiliary lighting  but in order to maintain the atmosphere of the bar  it had to be low  light shots . ray villalobos  the camera operator  was outstanding  he got some shots he had no hope of achieving and the impact of them brought a sense of reality to the film . thanks  ray   great work   ,1
after high  school graduation  best friends alice and darlene  decide to take a trip to thailand . whilst they are there  they meet a charming australian guy named nick . after spending some time with nick  he asks them if they want to take a weekend trip to hong kong with him . they agree . at the airport though  they are get busted for smuggling drugs and then get convicted for   years in a thai prison for something they say they haven  t done . not really knowing what to do they end contacting yankee hank  an american lawyer who lives in thailand with his wife . word has it that if you have the money he can help you . things start of well  but they still can  t get out .  br    br   the movie is really good because it doesn  t let on what  s going to happen and it  s interesting all the time . i couldn  t believe the ending though . it was one of those endings where you don  t know the     truth  but you still kind of know what really happened with nick and the drug smuggling because of the  owning up  etc .  br    br   claire danes and kate beckinsale both give quite good performances here . beckinsales performance was a little weak though . both danes and beckinsales characters friendship is good but could of seemed stronger . paul walker even has a small uncredited role here .    br    br   anyway  i thought brokedown palace was a good movie and i give it a     .  ,1
the late dudley moore had the most famous role of his too  short career in      s arthur  a raucously funny and alternately touching tale that generates warm smiles  big belly  laughs  and an occasional tear if you  re in the right mood . moore received a best actor oscar nomination for his performance as arthur bach  a drunken playboy who  races cars  plays tennis  fondles women  but he has weekends off and he  s his own boss .  arthur is destined to inherit    million dollars when he marries a snooty society girl named susan johnston  jill eikenberry  who is the spoiled daughter of an undercover gangster . things get sticky when arthur meets linda morolla  liza minnelli  a waitress  struggling actress from queens who steals neckties for her father  s birthday . moore lights up the screen in one of the single funniest performances of the last   years . the late sir john gielgud won a best supporting actor oscar for his flawless turn as arthur  s acid  tongued butler and best friend  hobson  whose outward disdain for arthur  s behavior covers more paternal feelings . there are other funny contributions by barney martin as linda  s father . stephen elliott as susan  s father  and geraldine fitzgerald as arthur  s demented grandmother . the film was directed with a keen eye for comedy by a first time director named steve gordon  who  sadly  died the following the year . there was also a forgettable sequel several years later  but this instant classic is not to be missed .  ,1
this movie is one among the very few indian movies  that would never fade away with the passage of time  nor would its spell binding appeal ever diminish  even as the indian cinema transforms into the abyss of artificially styled pop culture while drill oriented extras take to enhancing the p . t . styled film songs .  br    br   the cinematography speaks of the excellent skills of josef werching that accentuate the monumental and cinema scope effect of the film in its entirety .  br    br   gone are the days of great cinema  when every scene had to be clipped many times and retakes taken before finalizing it  while meticulous attention was paid in crafting and editing the scenes . some of its poignant scenes are filled with sublime emotional intensity  like the instance  when meena kumari refuses to say  yes  as an approval for nikah  marriage bond  and climbs down the hill while running berserk in traumatized frenzy . at the moment  raj kumar follows her  and a strong gale of wind blew away the veil of kumari and onto the legs of kumar . . . . . . . .  br    br   kamal amrohi shall always be remembered with golden words in the annals of indian cinema  s history for endeavoring to complete this movie in a record setting   years . he had to manage filming of some of the vital songs without meena  s close ups  because meena kumari  the lady in the lead role was terminally ill and fighting for her life in early     .  ,1
my wife and i started to watch this movie with anticipation . it looked warm and touching . it started out well but  soon became boring and frankly idiotic after a while . it got so bad that we turned it off the movie was poorly acted and honesty  we couldn  t really understand or wanted to understand what exactly why or how the hell they could put up with this woman  you lost sympathy for her after she was rude and acting wackos singing and cleaning . i would have had her committed . and  of course  like most movies and t . v series made in hollywood we have to throw it a token  gay  character  this movie was boring . i was expecting more from diane keaton   ,0
this is a movie that has a lot of things that only japanese people can understand . even well translated  there are some things that are obviously private jokes or regional symbolism . my guess is that it tried to send a message of some sort  but that just got wasted on me .  br    br   what i felt that is basically this is a mediocre movie with nice special effects . some kid becomes  the one  and in the end has almost no relevance to a yokai war that makes no sense whatsoever anyway . it would have been nice to understand what the hell they were talking about  but between the azumi bean washing yokai and the one that looks like a big tongued umbrella  rihanna eat your heart out   i couldn  t really discern the plot .  br    br   bottom line nice visuals  the kid screams a lot  the river princess is terrible cute and the rest is crap .  ,1
well  jesus of montreal is basically an intelligent movie . the actors are indeed good and the technical side of the movie is okay . but  although i was very interested in the topic and like to think and discuss about religion  i am an atheist   it was hard to force myself to watch the movie to the bitter and in my opinion somehow unconsciously funny end . why is this movie so incredibly boring  i don  t know . it just is and so it is not recommendable .  ,0
yeah  well  i definitely had regrets about giving up my saturday night watching this strange little  yet very long  movie . apparently neither did the main character for stealing two hours of my life . here  s the epitome of the antihero in  no regrets .  we have this jerk  so messed up  so wandering  so selfish  aimless and unlikable that it was extremely hard to get past the attraction a highly favored businessman  s up  and  coming son  jaemin  unless it was just that physical attraction . he claims otherwise  that it  s love . but after watching this  it  s like loving charles manson because you dig the beard .  alright  he  s not that bad  but still no real redeemable characteristics .  i could never get past the reason jaemin endless stalks sumin . it was never shown  just told  that jaemin loves sumin . perhaps it  s a culture thing that flew over my head crazy  stalking  mad love over in seoul . it has to be  because a little more than half the movie is one stalking the other and the last part is stalking back and forth to the point i thought this was turning into a screwball comedy . i was waiting for a tiger named  baby  to make an appearance . okay  so sumin works two jobs while going to school  so far so good on someone trying to better themselves . but after his first taste of his stalker  s attraction  he gives up his day job for some kind of prostitution ring . what  ok  well  as previously mentioned  the obsession doesn  t stop due to the job  career change and if you throw in a bunch of other very angry characters you get one messed up movie where unbelievable occurrences just seem to happen without buildup . basic movie  not     terrible  but you can do better with foreign gay  themed movies .  ,0
loved it but still have nightmares over the hotel manager . the movie  was presented well  with the choice of actors carrying their roles to reality of the writing . many scenes gripped the imagination and created a nail biter . the progression of situations were cleverly written  making me believe the story was headed one way only to find a new twist on what i thought might be the obvious . too bad there have to be commercials . i have told many friends to watch for further showings and i of course will view again . i enjoyed the scenery of the film and felt this added to the plots and intrigue . husband and wife heated discussions  or should i say fights   were very realistic . the initial situation is a common one but the escalation into the story presented fortunately is not . i want to thank all who were involved in this great entertainment film . thank you  looking forward to the next films    when  whidbey  ,1
in iran  women are not permitted to attend men  s sporting events  apparently to  protect  them from all the cursing and foul language they might hear emanating from the male fans  so since men can  t restrain or behave themselves  women are forced to suffer . go figure .  .  offside  tells the tale of a half dozen or so young women who  dressed like men  attempt to sneak into the high  stakes match between iran and bahrain that  in      qualified iran to go to the world cup  the movie was actually filmed in large part during that game  .  br    br    offside  is a slice  of  life comedy that will remind you of all those great humanistic films   the shop on main street    loves of a blonde    closely watched trains  etc .  that flowed out of communist czechoslovakia as part of the  prague miracle  in the mid      s . as with many of those works   offside  is more concerned with observing life than with devising any kind of elaborately contrived fictional narrative . indeed  it is the simplicity of the setup and the naturalism of the style that make the movie so effective .  br    br   once their ruse is discovered  the girls are corralled into a small pen right outside the stadium where they can hear the raucous cheering emanating from the game inside . stuck where they are  all they can do is plead with the security guards to let them go in  guards who are basically bumbling  good  natured lads who are compelled to do their duty as a part of their compulsory military service . even most of the men going into the stadium don  t seem particularly perturbed at the thought of these women being allowed in . still the prohibition persists . yet  how can one not be impressed by the very real courage and spunk displayed by these women as they go up against a system that continues to enforce such a ridiculously regressive and archaic restriction  and  yet  the purpose of these women is not to rally behind a cause or to make a  point .  they are simply obsessed fans with a burning desire to watch a soccer game and  like all the men in the country  cheer on their team .  br    br   it  s hard to tell just how much of the dialogue is scripted and how much of it is extemporaneous  but  in either case  the actors  with their marvelously expressive faces  do a magnificent job making each moment seem utterly real and convincing . mohammad kheir  abadi and shayesteh irani are notable standouts in a uniformly excellent cast . the structure of the film is also very loose and freeform  as writer  director jafar panahi and co  writer shadmehr rastin focus for a few brief moments on one or two of the characters  then move smoothly and effortlessly onto others . with this documentary  type approach  we come to feel as if we are witnessing an actual event unfolding in  real time .  very often  it  s quite easy for us to forget we  re actually watching a movie .  br    br   it was a very smart move on the part of the filmmakers to include so much good  natured humor in the film  it  s what the czech filmmakers did as well   the better to point up the utter absurdity of the situation and broaden the appeal of the film for audiences both domestic and foreign .  offside  is obviously a cry for justice  but it is one that is made all the more effective by its refusal to make of its story a heavy  breathing tragedy . instead  it realizes that nothing breaks down social barriers quite as efficiently as humor and an appeal to the audience  s common humanity . and isn  t that what true art is supposed to be all about  in its own quiet  understated way   offside  is one of the great  under  appreciated gems of     .  ,1
i recently saw i . q . and even though i  m not a romantic comedy type of gal  i think that it was just a nice and sweet movie to watch . so many movies in my opinion lack honesty . you know that feeling when you  re watching a movie and you just feel robbed because it  s taking something from the story and it was like the director just threw it together like it was trash  the story between the scientists is a sweet and funny one . how they stuck together and they tried to help tim robbins character become smart . i liked the love story between tim and meg because it was simple and brought up a good point when it comes to love   nothing is what it seems  . i would recommend this for a sunday morning .  br    br        ,1
the london underground has something inherently creepy about it  with its long winding tunnels  the escalators taking you deeper and deeper underground  and of course the rats roaming the tracks . it a source of wonder that it is not used in horror films more often . it was used in the seventies horror deathline aka raw meat  featuring a cannibalistic tribe living in a disused tunnel  and the celebrated chase sequence in american werewolf in london . so i was pleased to see that someone else had tried to capitalise on the atmosphere of the tube at night with the recent uk production creep .  br    br   i thought the film started off well  with a highly effective credit sequence that was genuinely unnerving  followed by a scene in the sewers that sets up the premise of there being something evil lurking below the streets of london . however  creep went downhill from here  and i found myself wishing that i  d switched it off after this opening scene  leaving me with a favourable impression of the film . all the characters become unsympathetic and unlikable  even potente herself  and the director felt the need to hit us over the head with social commentary about homelessness . he also made the mistake of showing the  monster  in full lighting  where he ceases to become remotely scary  and reveals his name to be craig . how can you have a monster called craig  it turns into an x files  type thing  and reminds one of the episode tombs . in fact  i was wishing mulder and scully would turn up and sort them all out for me .  br    br   as for the infamous sexualised violence  it is very graphic  disturbing and totally unnecessary . it seems to be there merely to shock the audience rather than for any intrinsic plot value . the trouble is it is so over the top and horrific that it actually numbs you to the rest of the horror  which is a mistake as it  s only halfway through the film .  br    br   so there you go . the only redeeming feature of the film for me was a rare appearance from ken campbell  one of my favourite occasional actors . you don  t see him very often  but when he  s on screen he acts everyone else into a corner . casting him as a sewer inspector was a stroke of genius  unfortunately the only one evident in the film .  ,0
the character acting is a little stiff  as if it is the first time man of the actors have appeared on screen . unfortunately one of the better actresses  jean simmons  played many bit roles on tv  like in star trek tng and in the heat of the night   dies quickly and thereafter her acting can be markedly missed .  br    br   the lead role is mr ballard  as portrayed by cliff robertson . cliff is forced to carry this movie with his body language for most of the time . he doesn  t do a poor job  but it is a little overmuch to ask of an actor to plug the oceans of blank screen time during which the characters spend their time not talking and also not acting . robertson  s most memorable role may have been ben parker in the last  spider man movies  starring tobey maguire  .  br    br   the plot is predictable . a husband murders his rich wife for her money . thereafter the wife seems to comeback and haunt the husband driving him insane until he leaps from a high window  fearing the specter of his dead wife approaching him  on the day he is predicted to die no less .  br    br   the second chauffeur mr ballard hires looks a lot like an english mark hamill . uncanny really  the only thing that stands out is the utter disregard for dialogue . many minutes pass in quietness  no one speaks  and few act . it is a shame the mst  k guys never got hold of this movie . it could have been much better  if not just as predictable  with more dialogue  or shorter scenes of  nothingness  .  br    br   i kept expecting g  mork  s red eyes to appear from the shadows and proclaim that he works for the  nothing  that inhabits this film .  ,0
with this cast and budget you will expect more .  br    br   john cusack has made a number movies that border on the strange  yet still work . neither he  his sister  nor sir ben could do anything to save this travesty of trite poorly written garbage .  br    br   the movie is nothing more than a series of sight gags and poor ones at that . the plot goes nowhere  the writing is contrived  senseless and the characters paper thin . if you think of a movie as being three dimensional where the story and characters bring a depth to the imagery  this stinker comes across as flat as steamboat mickey .  br    br   dan akroyd  s appearance in this brought back memories of another truly awful movie       s nothing but trouble . frankly this movie is the type of project that kills careers and gets agents fired .  ,0
this is an excellent  fast paced thriller by wes craven  nightmare on elm street   who for   minutes leaves aside the supernatural and presents us with something even more terrifying  the evil of human beings . we are far more likely to encounter the benign evil of jackson rippner than freddy kruger  and cillian murphy  batman begins  does an excellent job of presenting a sociable  friendly  even charismatic killer . the performances by murphy and by rachel mcadams  claire  from the wedding crashers  are brilliant . most of the film takes place on a very intimate level  between two people  their eyes  their faces . it is action on a small scale  not the broad sweep of the canvas  and it is no less compelling for these limitations . the cinematography is nothing special  though of course one can do only so much with a camera in the confines of a passenger jet  but the dialog is excellent  the story taut . there are no distractions  no subplots confuse the issue which is at its heart a battle between the main characters . by keeping his focus and avoiding distractions  wes craven is able to take what is a very minimal plot and turning it into an exciting  fast  paced action thriller .  ,1
this flick reminds me some really bad science  fiction movies from    s and    s . it is not scary or interesting  but it  s dull  cheesy and stupid . special effects are laughable  all actors are ludicrous and the ending is simply awful . don  t waste your money  rent or buy something better . i give it  .  out of    i found this turkey quite amusing because of its stupidity  .  ,0
i happened upon this film by accident  and really enjoyed . timothy busfield  s character is without redeeming qualities  and at one point  busfield and star meloni ogle women as they pass by . . . meloni  s take on the parade is different from busfield  s . janel maloney is terrific . . . she looks very much like tea leone  but the major difference here is that janel can actually act . some very nice things in this film and well worth your attention when it  s on cable .  ,1
the town of royston vasey is a weird  but wonderful place . the characters would be just wrong and too disturbing but the fantastically brilliant writing means that it works  and it works very well . most people will know others with a touch of some characters  but hopefully no one knows people with extremes of personalities such as tubbs and edward  the stranger  hating owners of the local shop  or the pen  obsessed pauline who treats  dole scum  with much contempt . that was only a few of the strange inhabitants . the tv works consists of  series and a christmas special . there are references to many horror films  such as the wicker man . a more recent addition to the range of works is a film  the league of gentlemens apocalypse  of which i will not say much but highly recommend . all in all the league of gentlemen is a hilarious comedy show with genius writing and brilliantly bonkers characters . i would definitely say that it is worth watching as you wont regret it   ,1
a delightful little thriller opens with trevor howard in his jag convertible and ends on a dockside in liverpool . it  s all thrills and spills as the ex  spy has to restart his career just as he  s getting some serious r  r cataloguing butterflies  how british is that   .  br    br   trevor howard and jean simmons frolic from london to newcastle  upon  tyne to liverpool  via ullswater   he  s just been thrown out of mi  or something  and she  you guessed it  is on the run  wrongly accused of murder . there  s seedy docks  rolling lake district hills  sheep  country pubs  coppers getting lost  waterfalls  a bunch of amateur cyclists  rooftop chases  and lots of chinamen  don  t ask   and it  s all very hitchcocky and hannayesque . . .  br    br   . . and a smashing example of british noir . . .  ,1
you can debate prince  s acting talent  or even his choice to parody his own life in this film . there is no debate about his musical talent either then or now . he seems like a shadowy has  been twenty years later  but the music remains relevant and fantastic .  br    br   having lived through the hype of this movie  graduated high school in     i can tell you that there was nothing bigger at the time . from tipper gore  al  s wife  trying to censor  little nikki  and every thing else under the sun via the pmrc  parents music resource center  to every  air band  at the time impersonating prince  it was the absolute hottest thing out . for a few weeks at least  prince was bigger than madonna and michael jackson .  br    br   we all waited for the film and were soooooo excited when it premiered . it didn  t disappoint . everyone was caught up . i was an mtv junkie at the time  they actually played music then . . . . all the time  prince played at least once or twice an hour . i must qualify this commentary by saying that  at that time  my favorites were billy idol  oingo boingo  the fixx  flock of seagulls and others in the punk  new wave genre  the music of prince at the time transcended all types and styles . one of the reasons that some of it seems so cheesy and contrite now is that it was soooooooo big then . all the things that remind you of the    s were iconic then . it was mainstream and it seems like a clich  now . it got so popular that it became ridiculous . it  s like the rappin  granny commercial for wendy  s hamburgers .  br    br   it looks stupid now because everyone was caught up in it  sadly  kind of like a bizarre purple macarena or something . anyway  i hope this gave you all a little insight .  ,1
if this could be rated a   it would be . from the atrocious wooden acting to the dull  plodding pace  the puerile exploitation angle and the sophomoric pseudolesbian titillation added purely for the sake of the sad viewers  this is a disaster of a film .  br    br   the plot is predictable  as from the beginning one is absolutely certain of what will happen to all of the characters and how the plot will commence . from a boring  unexceptional beginning to a pathetic and bleak ending  every single presence in this film is wasted  and every meagre scrap of talent dug up for this turkey is squandered .  br    br   if you want to watch something as relentlessly bleak with plenty of the same childish titillation  watch one of the ilsa films . at least they  re unapologetic and up  front about what they  re trying to do . how something this horrendously bad ever managed to be rated above a  is a miracle of how people with no taste or discerning standards can sometimes come together for the most dubious of purposes .  br    br   it  s not scary  it  s not interesting  and above all it  s not arousing in any sense of the word . it is  in my opinion  a crime it is a crime that such a horribly offensive and incompetent piece of trash was ever conceived of and given the resources to come into existence  and even more a tragedy that it is still defended by some woefully misguided viewers .  br    br   not even elvira  s cheerful personality and joking ways could soften the blow that this horrifying travesty of film is . avoid it at all costs .  ,0
  i have looked into the eye of this island  and what i saw was beautiful   proclaims one of the main characters in abc  s award winning television show  lost  . the series could be summarized as a drama story about a group of plane crash survivors stranded on an unknown island  but that would be doing the show a disservice .  lost  follows a large group of characters who come into conflict with the island  each other  and ultimately themselves as they struggle with their new way of life and their dependency on each other . the situation becomes more complicated when it becomes clear this isn  t an ordinary island  either  and that they may not be alone .  br    br   my initial fear after hearing the concept of this series was the lack of new stories they could tell us after a certain period  but this proved to be unfounded . the narrative flows naturally  the dialogue is witty  the characters are memorable and the execution is superb . the island is a character all on its own  and to understand this comment you  d have to see the series for yourself  which only goes to show its originality and greatness .  br    br   at the time of writing this review  only the first two seasons have aired  and they  re filled with strong episodes . my only mild criticism is that the second season seems to slow down a bit halfway  but then fortunately comes back in admirable shape for the final episodes .  br    br   if i can recommend one television series you should be following right now  it would certainly be this one . if you like excitement  adventure  character driven stories  an extremely strong cast and crew  beautiful locations  and an island that seems more spiritual than natural   lost  is for you . just be sure you start at the beginning .  ,1
i saw this film when it was originally released in     . i enjoyed it then  and i still do now . but what i realize now is that this is quite  adult  for a film with a g rating  especially the notion of dying and going to heaven . burt reynolds and dom deluise work wonderfully together  and reynolds  singing voice is appropriate for a junkyard dog . there are some good songs ranging from upbeat   let  s make music together   to downright emotional   home to my heart   . i found the plot good  although it does go off on a tangent once or twice . the final scene of the film with charlie and anne  marie is one of the saddest i  ve ever seen in animation . a film worth experiencing .  ,1
when you typically watch a short film your always afraid that the person creating the film tries to throw too much into it . that  s not the case with this one . a great story about a young girl who  s had enough and other worldly forces trying to help make things right .  br    br   eric etebari does a wonderful job of representing the spirit of twisted justice and helps to convey the complexities of the blurred line of right and wrong .  br    br   both the young girl and the father give great performances in this wonderful short film  but eric  s performance is definitely the show stealer in this story .  br    br   i definitely recommend this film for it  s complexity  performance  and great over all story .  ,1
if asked how i would define the word  shallow  i would reply  watch a jerry bruckheimer production  . if asked how i would define the phrase  wasted potential  i would reply  watch a jerry bruckheimer production  . bruckheimer productions are nearly always sure fire hits at the box office but nearly always receive critical pannings from the critics . off the top of my head i can only think of an officer and a gentleman and black hawk down getting a lot of critical acclaim .  br    br   crimson tide too received some begrudging acclaim from critics  its certainly one of bruckheimers better films which alas isnt saying much . the problem i had is the scenario that sets up the story  the russians are fighting the chechens and the conflict spreads through the whole of russia leading to an ultra nationalist russian to take over a nuclear missile base and threaten the west if they interfere . maybe the ending of the cold war had everything to do with it but i found this set up very unconvincing . its not helped by some errors in geography like the french carrier foch being in the med  wouldnt the foch be better positioned in the black sea   or that the expositional newsreel consists of familar footage featuring conflicts from the balkans  the first gulf war and even vietnam . once again the adjective  very unconvincing  crept into my mind . the story does improve somewhat when the story proper  a battle of wills concerning orders between a nuclear submarine commander and his number two  gets underway . director tony scott does his best as do the cast  but the problem still lies in an unconvincing scenario . the worst thing is that if this had been made in the mid     s when ww  was a real possibility  nay probability  this film would have terrified me  but after the cold war ended so had the dangers of nuclear war which means crimson tide has little impact .  ,0
the movie has the longest  most tortured and agonized ending of any movie i  ve seen in a long time . unfortunately it starts right after the opening credits . january jones gives such a wooden performance  i was surprised she didn  t go up in flames when she got near the candles in the film . i don  t really remember her from the other films she  s done  a blessing i have to believe . i never criticize an actors performance because in film there are too many things which can affect it but in this case  it is so bad that it actually stands out from the atrocious script . granted she  s given lines and situations meryl streep would have trouble with but i swear at times shes reading from a cue card off set . at other times i thought she might actually be learning disabled or slow in some way . for real  the plot  dialog and pacing are as bad as you  ll ever see but there is still no excuse for this performance nor for the director that let it be perpetrated . i feel sorry for the other actors . cruel intentions    little indians  breakfast club shoved into a rotten burrito then regurgitated by a grade school writer  director . take that back this has studio exec crayola all over it .  ,0
mr . destiny   .    stars  br    br    mr . destiny  s  theme is recycled from many films spanning many different years . its theme ranges from recent spoofs on such plots  see  scrooged    to the same  more serious and dramatic notion that worked in  it  s a wonderful life   and a century earlier in the story of scrooge as told by charles dickens in  a christmas carol .   it involves an ungrateful man being taken on a guided tour of his life  and witnessing how his life could have been  or would have been  first  hand .  br    br   in most of these types of movies the guardian angel rescues a man from ungratefulness and shows him his life in retrospect  or how it could have been . should have been . would have been . in this case we are shown a businessman named larry  james belushi  . he hates his life . he lives with an unexciting wife  linda hamilton  and yearns for a bigger life with bigger meaning . if only he had hit the ball at the state championship in high school years ago . he is convinced his life would have been better . i guess he remembers this seemingly small moment of his life because it made a big impact on his subconscious side  but i doubt a grown man would yearn for one single act from high school . still  it works in the movie .  br    br   anyway  larry is driving home from work one night  where he is a penpusher along with jon lovitz  when his car breaks down . he wanders into a bar looking for a pay phone  and reluctantly decides to tell the bartender  michael caine  about the way his life is turning out . this is where we first see him remembering his childhood baseball strike  out .  br    br   the bartender listens and nods  apparently not worrying about any other customers . this is probably due to the fact that the bar  though old and tattered  seems to have never been occupied by any living humans save these two men . in fact  larry even makes a comment about never seeing the bar before . this is most likely for a certain reason that the audience is expecting before larry .  br    br   so the bartender  who may as well be an angel of god incarnate  just like clarence  fixes larry a special drink of his  which ends up putting larry  s life on reverse  showing him what his life would have been like if he had hit the home run all those years before . but larry has no idea of any change at first  just like jimmy stewart didn  t realize that clarence had erased his life until he went into the bar and got kicked out larry continues to be oblivious to any change until he goes to his home to find the lawn different outside  and a large  wrestler  type man occupying his home .  br    br   larry soon finds out his life would indeed have been very different had he hit the home run . instead of marrying linda hamilton he married rene russo and moved into a large mansion with children . he finds out that jon lovitz is no longer his friend but an employee of his . and the most surprising fact of all is that with his new life  that larry has always wanted . . . he finds himself lusting after his old wife  linda hamilton proof that sometimes money and a great  looking yet shallow wife don  t make up everything in a man  s life  like an intelligent wife and love and true happiness . just like  it  s a wonderful life  showed the audience a man  s life is what he makes it  and that every person has an impact on people   mr . destiny  shows us that material wealth is not the same as spiritual wealth  a lesson taught us over and over again  but never quite so fluffy  forgettable and truly sweet as it is shown us in  mr . destiny .   br    br    mr . destiny  is never exceedingly hilarious  but it is a sweet  good  natured comedy that never takes itself too seriously . the problem with all the  it  s a wonderful life  retreads out there  like  the family man   is that they try to be as influential and memorable as  it  s a wonderful life  was . but there are only so many times you can single  handedly rip off a famous film  and  mr . destiny  knows this  and plays right to the fact . it doesn  t try to be anything it isn  t rather  it is something it didn  t try to be  and this is obvious to the audience .  br    br    ,1
a genuine screaming situation comedy farce of the mid   s this film was a huge hit for about  minutes and disappeared off the face of the earth . i am constantly amazed at some comedy films that are a big release one week and then vanish high anxiety  the cheap detective  the black bird  don  t look now we  re being shot at . . . . . . . . . . and have no profile at all today . norman was the comedy of the month in whenever     and everyone seemed to see it  laugh about it and then never ever mention it ever again . famous for being shot on videotape and transferred to film  an experiment at the time  norman is a raucous politically incorrect closet slamming farce that the farrelly brothers should look at remaking today . if they had made it in the first place there would be no complaints about its content and slant either . it is very funny and yes very rude and hilariously all wrong . just as it should be . in fact as a groovy     film with all those horror colours and clothes it actually works better today .  ,1
i  ve seen this movie more than once . it was on par with a lot of the spooky stuff that was being shown in television movies back then . the only problem i had was with the title for the obvious reasons . . . one immediately thinks of the famous snack cake by drake  s  leaving off the first part   hound of hell  would have sufficed .  br    br   richard crenna always manages to bring a sense of seriousness to anything he does  anyway  whether the plot is good or bad . but this was an enjoyable halloween fare offered by the cbs network . i loved the part where crenna takes a flight to some obscure country to find the mystic who would help him conquer the evil beast . he asks the cab driver how to find this guy . great dialogue between the native cab driver and crenna in terms of the cabby dissing his own people  s ethnic beliefs .  aw  mr . barry  i left that stuff behind when i came down from the mountains . . .   referring to the mystic who rarely sees or advises people  and nobody knows how to really contact him .  br    br   as far as supernatural fare goes  this movie is still enjoyable .  ,1
there are no spoilers in this review . there  s nothing to spoil .  br    br   no plot  nothing most clip shows at least try to tie the clips into the plot by some tenuous stretch  but this didn  t even do that . clips  three lines to lead into the next interminable sequence of dull clips . . . ok  so perhaps they were short on production time  but they  d have been better off skipping this episode entirely . what a waste of time .  br    br   i  m not sure how this got made  in fact . scrubs is usually much better at subverting tropes  but somehow this got through . . . .  br    br   thank heavens they were back on form by the next episode .  ,0
i looked over the other comments and was thoroughly amused to find that clearly only people who actually worked on the movie had commented . i mean  i hate to say bad things about an amateur production  but if you make a bad movie and want to comment on it  tone it down a little .  groundbreaking  is a little over the top . this is a boston based college production that doesn  t even achieve the level of most amateur college film . it  s what you would expect a bunch of kids to do . a silly action film without much creativity . it  s pretty funny if you  re willing to poke fun at it . not something you will ever see unless you are a student at emerson college .  ,0
yes  this is an ultra  low budget movie . so the acting isn  t award winning material and at times the action is slow  paced because the filmmakers are shooting longer sequences and not a million instants that then get edited into a movie . this film makes up for that with an outstanding script that takes vampirism seriously  explains it and develops a full plot out of it . aside from the vampire story  we get detailed genetics info  legal and law enforcement  martial arts action  philosophical musings  and some good metal music . kudos go to dylan o  leary  the director  writer  main actor . it is beyond me how this man could have fulfilled all these roles and do them so well . i think to appreciate this movie  you have to be well  versed in all sorts of themes to see that the writer did a lot of research and knows about all these things . there are some great camera work  too  interesting camera angles and one underwater vampire attack  something i haven  t seen before  but which pays homage to the underwater zombie attack in fulci  s zombi . the casting is good  in so far as the sexy female is sexy indeed . the main vampire also looks perfect for the role . the female victim looks vulnerable . my only complaint is that for a low budget horror flick  there should have been more nudity . if you want to see an original vampire movie with a great story  this flick is for you . i  m looking forward to seeing future projects by mr . o  leary .  ,1
  gone with the wind  is one of the most overrated movies in history . it is a film loved by mothers  grandmothers  and shut  ins who go to the movies once every five years . as a zombie movie  it blows . there isn  t a shambling corpse in sight  and it  s terribly light in the gore department .  zombie    on the other hand  is big on shambling corpses and quite generous with its blood  spilling   therefore  it is better than  gone with the wind  . it is also not overrated . most reviewers are under no delusions that it is rubbish . it is  however  not boring rubbish . after a terrorist steals a virus  he drops it while being pursued by a helicopter  and the chemicals leak into the ground . the terrorist  who has been exposed to the nasty concoction  hides in a hotel room where he slowly morphs into a flesh  eating zombie . one of his first victim  s is a cleaning lady . once she  s bitten  lucio fulci  s brand of hell breaks loose . as usual for a fulci flick  the acting is atrocious  the storyline is riddled with plot holes  and the gore is plentiful . turns out the film was directed by fulci and bruno mattei  so that explains its rather schizophrenic nature . it is badly shot  too  poorly edited  and the sound design is flat . still  it is saved by its gleeful adherence to the goriest of murders and its impatient pacing . definitely worth picking up if you  re an undead completest . or don  t like  gone with the wind   undoubtedly the worst zombie movie of all time .  ,0
this is the first review i  ve wrote for imdb so bare with me  but i caught this flick on hbo and was sure glad i watched it . richard gere is great in this film as the passionate agent  detective who bends the rules to get the job done . i think the story is great  and there  s never a dull scene that slows the pace of the movie down . some parts of the movie which have to do with demented sex addicts are pretty shocking  but if you  ve ever seen a crime film like se  en  you  ll be able to stomach the scenes just fine .  br    br   so all in all  if you  re looking for a good detective  suspense movie  ignore the low rating this movie got on imdb and definitely watch it .  ,1
  national treasure        is a thoroughly misguided hodge  podge of plot entanglements that borrow from nearly every cloak and dagger government conspiracy clich that has ever been written . the film stars nicholas cage as benjamin franklin gates  how precious is that  i ask you    a seemingly normal fellow who  for no other reason than being of a lineage of like  minded misguided fortune hunters  decides to steal a  national treasure  that has been hidden by the united states founding fathers . after a bit of subtext and background that plays laughably  unintentionally  like indiana jones meets the patriot  the film degenerates into one misguided whimsy after another  attempting to create a  stanley goodspeed  regurgitation of nicholas cage and launch the whole convoluted mess forward with a series of high octane  but disconnected misadventures .  br    br   the relevancy and logic to having george washington and his motley crew of patriots burying a king  s ransom someplace on native soil  and then  going through the meticulous plan of leaving clues scattered throughout u . s . currency art work  is something that director jon turteltaub never quite gets around to explaining . couldn  t washington found better usage for such wealth during the start up of the country  hence  we are left with a mystery built on top of an enigma that is already on shaky ground by the time ben appoints himself the new custodian of this untold wealth . ben  s intentions are noble  if confusing . he  s set on protecting the treasure . for who and when  your guess is as good as mine .  br    br   but there are a few problems with ben  s crusade . first up  his friend  ian holmes  sean bean  decides that he can  t wait for ben to make up his mind about stealing the declaration of independence from the national archives  oh  yeah  brilliant idea   . presumably  the back of that famous document holds the secret answer to the ultimate fortune . so ian tries to kill ben . the assassination attempt is  of course  unsuccessful  if overly melodramatic . it also affords ben the opportunity to pick up  and pick on  the very sultry curator of the archives  abigail chase  diane kruger  . she thinks ben is clearly a nut  at least at the beginning . but true to action  romance form  abby  s resolve melts quicker than you can say   is that the hope diamond   the film moves into full x  file  ish mode  as the fbi  mistakenly believing that ben is behind the theft  retaliate in various benign ways that lead to a multi  layering of action sequences reminiscent of mission impossible meets the fugitive . honestly  don  t those guys ever get  intelligence  information that is correct  in the final analysis   national treasure  isn  t great film making  so much as it  s a patchwork rehash of tired old bits from other movies  woven together from scraps  the likes of which would make il  betsy ross blush .  br    br   the buena vista dvd delivers a far more generous treatment than this film is deserving of . the anamorphic widescreen picture exhibits a very smooth and finely detailed image with very rich colors  natural flesh tones  solid blacks and clean whites . the stylized image is also free of blemishes and digital enhancements . the audio is  .  and delivers a nice sonic boom to your side and rear speakers with intensity and realism . extras include a host of promotional junket material that is rather deep and over the top in its explanation of how and why this film was made . if only  as an audience  we had had more clarification as to why ben and co . were chasing after an illusive treasure  this might have been one good flick . extras conclude with the theatrical trailer  audio commentary and deleted scenes . not for the faint  hearted  just the thick  headed .  ,0

an american in paris is an integrated musical  meaning that the songs and dances blend perfectly with the story . the film was inspired by the     orchestral composition by george gershwin .  br    br   the story of the film is interspersed with show  stopping dance numbers choreographed by gene kelly and set to popular gershwin tunes . songs and music include  i got rhythm     s wonderful   and

 an   minute dance featuring kelly and caron set to gershwin  s an american in paris  featuring an impressionistic period daydream in the style of various painters  is one of the longest uninterrupted dance sequences of any hollywood film . the ballet alone cost more than half a million dollars  a staggering sum at the time .  br    br   it  s funny to think of such a work of art being born over a pool game between film producer arthur freed  singin  in the rain  wizard of oz  on the town  meet me in st . louis and the band wagon  and ira gershwin . it was freed  s idea to buy the title so he could use if in a film about paris and gershwin  s idea that it would only use gershwin music .  br    br   original cast was to have cyd charisse but she discovered she was pregnant before shooting began . a major reason gene kelly suggested leslie caron as the female lead was because he felt this movie needed a  real  french girl playing lise  not just an american actress playing one . gene kelly discovered leslie caron while vacationing in paris where he saw her perform in a ballet . when she got the call to audition  she said   who  s gene kelly   according to leslie caron  her introductory dance sequence  which included a seductive dance with a chair  was considered too suggestive by some censors . gene kelly directed the brief fantasy dance sequences shown as lise is

musicals with meet me in st . louis        an american in paris  and the band wagon       . he used color and songs in ways they hadn  t been used before . he used space and time imaginatively . best of all  though  he allowed himself to cut loose for the long ballet sequences that end all his movies . the ballet in an american in paris may be his best work .  br    br   even though vincente minnelli is credited as the sole director  he was sometimes tied up with his divorce from judy garland and other directing projects  leaving gene kelly to take over the directing duties .  br    br   other highlights include guetary  s rendition of  stairway to paradise   oscar levant  s fantasy of conducting and performing gershwin  s  concerto in f   see why it was oscar levant  s favorite .   br    br   the ballet sequence  now that we know it was successful everybody now wants to take credit for it  freed  minnelli  kelly but before the film was completed the new york office of mgm said no to spending a half million dollars on a ballet . so freed went to studio head louis b . mayer himself and got him to agree  new york said no . finally gene kelly showed the new york office how a british film  the red shoes used a long ballet sequence and that film became a world wide hit  and is still considered today the premium example of a successful art film . well the financial guys finally gave in and signed the checks .  br    br   there was a break in production after  november      at which point gene kelly began rehearsing the ballet choreography . by the time production for that final sequence resumed on  december  vincente minnelli had finished directing another film  father  s little dividend       .  br    br   irene sharaff designed a style for each of the ballet sequence sets  reflecting various french impressionist painters  raoul dufy   the place de la concorde   edouard manet  the flower market   maurice utrillo  a paris street   henri rousseau  the fair    vincent van gogh   the place de l  opera   and henri de toulouse  lautrec  the moulin rouge  . the backgrounds took six weeks to build  with   painters working nonstop .  br    br   roger ebert said after viewing the recent restoration   an american in paris has many qualities  not least its famous ballet production number  with kelly and leslie caron symbolizing the entire story of their courtship in dance .  an american in paris is often compared to singin  in the rain as to which it the greatest musical ever made  and one critic put it best when he said   singin  in the rain makes me happy and an american in paris makes me feel good .  the ballet represents kelly  s fantasies as depicted by the great french artists  renoir  rousseau  lautrec  dufy  he admires . arranging a screening for the then ailing raoul dufy  the actor and producer ducked out until the end credits . there  relieved  they found the artist  moved to tears  requesting a second helping of the sumptuous finale .  br    br   the film was also the first to win a golden globe award for best motion picture  comedy or musical .   br    br   gene kelly received an honorary academy award that year for  his versatility as an actor  singer  director and dancer  and specifically for his brilliant achievements in the art of choreography on film .  it was his only oscar .  ,1
i have been wanting to see cut since the day i have heard of it  which was sometime last year . anyway i got to see today  and when the movie started i thought that it started rather week but it got better after   mins or so . i thought that the movie was pretty good . but the thing i didn  t like was how the killer was created  i was thinking just before i rented that it would probably suck just like urban legends final cut  i almost died it . mostly everything in ul final cut needed to be improved . cut is    times better than ulfinal cut . the best part of cut is the killer and the death scenes . the killer kicks mo fing ass .  br    br   i give cut a  out of    ,1
dull haunted house thriller finds an american family moving into a    year old house in japan where a violent murder suicide love triangle occurred .  br    br   novel setting is about the only element of interest in this very slow moving horror flick by the director of motel hell . the film generates zero suspense and is composed of somewhat choppy scenes that rarely seem to be leading anywhere overall .  br    br   one obvious example is a fairly early scene where the male lead visits a temple after realizing that his house is haunted as the monk had earlier warned . the monk recounts the history of the house  which the viewer is already familiar with from the opening sequence  and then the film simply cuts away to something else . earlier the monk had offered to help . well  where is the help  the family continues to stay in the haunted house as things get worse and worse and no mention of the monk is made until nearly the very end when he turns up again to do what he should have done an hour earlier   try to drive the spirits out of the house  although by this time it  s difficult for the viewers to care .  br    br   there are some  probably  unintentional campy laughs in seeing the american actors at the end become possessed by the japanese spirits and suddenly start doing bad martial arts  i say probably because the scene is more than a little reminiscent of the chainsaw duel from the same director  s motel hell which was more obviously meant to be amusing  but on the whole this is a forgettable dud .  ,0
excellent  br    br   good  br    br   fair  br    br   poor  br    br   go ahead  make my day    br    br   the fourth picture in the series is directed by eastwood himself  who was rumored of directing most of magnum force  and he brings back the violent society from the first two films . however  the film still lacks impact and believability . this film was released in the early    s  the time of regan and the young republicans . the premise of a raped woman taking vengeance on her rapist doesn  t appeal to this time frame . this plot would have been better for the enforcer  which actually would have made it a good movie . what sudden impact needed was a plot like in wall street but with dirty harry in the middle .  br    br   rating  stars  ,1
kubrick meets king . it sounded so promising back in the spring of      i remember . then the movie came out  and the kubrick cultists have been bickering with the king cultists ever since .  br    br   the king cultists say stanley kubrick took a great horror tale and ruined it . the kubrick cultists don  t give a damn about king  s story . they talk about steadicams  tracking shots  camera angles . this is a film  they insist it should be considered on its own . as it happens  both camps are correct . unfortunately .  br    br   if one views it purely as an adaptation of king  s novel   the shining  is indeed a failure  a wasted opportunity  a series of botched narrative gambits .  br    br   i used to blame that on kubrick  s screenwriter . the writer diane johnson  author of le marriage  l  affaire  le divorce  etc .  has a reputation as an novelist of social manners . maybe she was chosen for her subtle grasp of conjugal relations or family dynamics . but the little blue  collar town of sidewinder  colorado doesn  t exist on any map in her francophile universe .  br    br   kubrick the anglophile probably found her congenial  however . he  of course  is the real auteur . and considered on its own merits  his screenplay for  the shining    with its mishmash of abnormal psychology  rationalism  supernaturalism  and implied reincarnation   just doesn  t stand up to logical analysis .  br    br   i  m willing to consider kubrick  s  shining  on its own terms . i  m even willing to take it as something other than a conventional horror  genre movie . but it doesn  t succeed as a naturalistic study of isolation  alienation  and madness either . parsed either way  the film pretty much falls apart .  br    br   are the horrors of the overlook hotel real  or do they exist only in the mind   first as prescient nightmares suffered by little danny torrance  then as the hallucinations of his father  one notes how whenever jack torrance is seen talking to a  ghost  he is in fact looking into a mirror . one notes how the hotel  s frozen topiary  hedge maze appears to symbolize jack  s stunted  convoluted psyche . very deep stuff .  br    br   but if indeed the overlook  s  ghosts  are purely manifestations of jack torrance  s growing insanity  then who exactly lets the trapped jack out of the hotel kitchen  s dead  bolted walk  in closet  so that he can go on his climactic ax  wielding rampage   br    br   and can anyone explain  with a straight face  that black  and  white photograph  helpfully labelled        of nicholson as a tuxedoed party  goer that pops up out of left field and onto a hotel  ballroom wall during the film  s closing seconds  are we to seriously conclude that jack torrance  s bad craziness stems from a some sort of  past life  experience   and if you swallow that  since when are reincarnated people supposed to be exact physical replicas their past selves    br    br   maybe kubrick didn  t care about his storyline . maybe only wanted to evoke a mood of horror . whatever the case  the film tries to hedge its narrative bets   to have it both ways  rational and supernatural . as a result  the story is a mess . this movie hasn  t improved with age  and it certainly doesn  t improve with repeated viewings .  br    br   i don  t deny that a few moments of fear  claustrophobia  and general creepiness are scattered throughout this long  long film . but those gushing elevators o  blood  seen repeatedly in little danny  s visions  are absurd and laughable . and jack torrance  s infamous tag lines   wendy  i  m home   and  heeeeeere  s johnny    merely puncture the movie  s dramatic tension and dissipate its narrative energy .  i know i sat in the theater and heard the audience laugh in comic relief  whew  glad we don  t have to take this stuff seriously    finally  kubrick is completely at sea   or else utterly cynical   during those scenes in which wendy wanders around the empty hotel while her husband tries to puree their son . a foyer full of mummified guests  all sitting there dead in their party hats  yikes  now i really am afraid .  br    br   given jack nicholson  s brilliance over the years  one can only assume that he gave just the sort of eyeball  rolling  eyebrow  wiggling  scenery  chomping performance that the director wanted . the performance of shelley duvall  as a sort of female version of don knotts in  the ghost and mr . chicken   is best passed over in silence .  br    br   this movie simply doesn  t succeed   not as an adaptation  not on its own terms . it probably merits a  out of    but i  m giving it a  because it has been so grotesquely over  rated in this forum .  ,0
i first saw this film around ten years ago and i thought it was very funny indeed . it was not as bad as some critics were making it out to be . the fact that it was written by the usually dependable john hughes shows that you can at least expect some funny dialogue .  by the way  i also think weird science is quite good which was also penned in lightning speed by hughes  .  br    br   the film has a very garish look to it using all the primary colours  reds  yellows etc  which makes it look quite unique . the cast are also quite good . the prudish bunny packard and the devil  possessed delores salk are a stand out .  br    br   the film has certainly dated a little but i personally prefer it to all the other  lampoon  series .  ,1
  george lopez   in my opinion  is an absolute abc classic  i haven  t seen every episode  but i still enjoy it . there are many episodes that i enjoyed . one of them was where amy  sandra bullock  walked into a moving piece of machinery . if you want to know why  you  ll have to have seen it for yourself . before i wrap this up  i  d like to say that everyone always gave a good performance  the production design was spectacular  the costumes were well  designed  and the writing was always very strong . in conclusion  even though new episodes can currently be seen  i strongly recommend you catch it just in case it goes off the air for good .  ,1
  tarzan and his mate   the second of mgm  s tarzan pictures  picks up a year after the events of  tarzan the ape man  . tarzan and jane have been living happily in the jungle  and harry holt  one of the expeditioners in the first film  returns  this time accompanied by the less  than  honorable martin arlington  in quest of the ivory from the elephants  graveyard . naturally  a variety of perilous and exciting adventures take place along the way .  br    br   the first film romanticized everything   the jungle  adventure  romance itself  wild animals  and even death . the second film still has a great deal of romanticism and a lot of wonderful action sequences  but a more serious tone underlies the action . the characters dare to ask questions like what if something happened to tarzan  what would jane do if she was stranded by herself in the middle of the jungle and she had to fend for herself  while these are probably the questions real people would be asking in this situation  it creates a certain amount of somberness that isn  t always as much fun as the throw  caution  to  the  wind attitude of the original .  br    br   one of the most enjoyable aspects of this film is the growth we see in tarzan and jane  s relationship . tarzan still speaks very broken english  but he has clearly learned a few new words from his mate . additionally  their love for each other has really blossomed  and we feel like they really have spent a year together in the jungle .  br    br   most people consider  tarzan and his mate  superior to the original  tarzan the ape man  . personally  i liked the first film just a little bit better . the main reason is that the relationship between the harry holt  martin arlington team isn  t nearly as likable as holt  s relationship with james parker  jane  s father  from the original . the mr . arlington character could have worked as a great movie villain  but he plays the hero for far too much of the movie . the movie can never decide whether we should like him or hate him .  also  i don  t want to give anything away  but in one of the scenes where we should clearly hate him  jane never finds out about those events  so the ending isn  t quite as satisfying as it could have been .  all of these detractors are relatively minor  however  and it  s still a great movie .  br    br   like the first film   tarzan and his mate  has amazing action scenes  wonderful wildlife footage  and one of the screen  s all  time greatest romances . if you liked the first film in the series  this is definitely a sequel to see .  ,1
a terrible storyline  amis at his worst   pointless and self  conscious  decadence   obvious shock tactics and patchy acting make this film  rather like  rancid aluminium   embody everything that went wrong with the much  vaunted british film revival . the humour is  at best  limp  and the pretentiousness of the whole set  up  including some kind of  internet terrorist group   ooh  how contemporary  really begins to grate .  br    br   final summary  a half  baked attempt to be  edgy  that does no  one any favours . still  it  s always a pleasure to see katy carmichael on screen . . .  br    br    ,0
i grew up watching this series . i was about seven  eight years old when it was on . i still remember the  st episode which was called  the new house .  it scared the hll out of me  i can almost still hear that statue  laughing madly . and the ending  oh my god  the hooror spirit comes in the room for the child yikes  this was classic tv and it was a one of a kind series . i have found a dvd collection for sale on the internet  actually . my question to any readers has anyone purchased this set  its a bootleg . both sellers claim to have very good copy . i have a sketchy and poor dvd of  the new house  episode  and a couple of other episodes that are a bit better  however  if anyone knows if these are much clearer it would be worth it to me to buy and share with my kids . a great series  clever  scary and daringly supernatural . thanks in advance to any fans who have the low down on any of this  in fact  i  d love to discuss it . chris walker  ,1
this very peculiar setting of wagner  s last opera definitely grew on me . when i first saw it  i was somewhat annoyed by many of the films surrealistic images  and felt that far too much was superimposed upon the story . however  if you can put up with a fair amount of rather recherch  gimmicks   i think you will find that the film does manage to capture the very strange  other  worldly atmosphere of the opera  and that there are moments which are particularly fine .  br    br   personally  i never really understood the role of kundry until i saw how edith clever portrayed her . her performance  a lip  synchronized mime of the singing voice of yvonne minton  is nothing short of dazzling  from end to end  and alone justifies the hours it takes to absorb the film .  br    br   another reason to delight in this film is that it captures the spectacular interpretation of robert lloyd of the crucial role of gurnemanz  one which lloyd has performed to a crisp at opera houses throughout the world . i have been privileged to enjoy him in the role of gurnemanz on the stage of the metropolitan opera several times  and the lusciousness of his voice  and the warm  fatherliness of his interpretation of this noble character really needed to be preserved  as did his performance in the character  s two major monologues  the karfreitag scene and the recounting of the prophecy in act  .  br    br   the version i have seen was a videotape made for america  and so there were subtitles which  alas  could not be done away with . this is especially unfortunate because the translation used is very inaccurate and forces an extremely christian interpretation on a film which is already forcing layers of interpretation on the opera . this seemed to me to be quite contrary both to wagner  s clear avoidance of christianity  and his very deliberate attempt to  generalize  the christian elements of the story .  see footnote with spoiler at the end of this review .  i find it nearly impossible  when viewing a film with subtitles  to keep from absorbing them  and strongly recommend that  if in the dvd versions you have the ability to turn the subtitles off  you do so  and instead  if the opera is unfamiliar to you  that you read the libretto carefully beforehand .  br    br   the bottom line is that there is much in the film which i dislike  and would just as soon have seen done differently . . . but it has risen steadily in my estimation over the years since i first saw it  and i find myself drawn to enjoy it again and again .  br    br                                                                      br    br   footnote containing a spoiler a good example would be kundry  s famous line   i saw him . . . him . . . and laughed .  this gets translated  in the subtitles  for reasons which escape me  as  i saw the savior  s face .  it is especially irritating to me  because throughout the libretto  wagner very deliberately and carefully refers to this unseen character who need not be the biblical jesus as  der heiland   i . e .  the german for  the healer    a reference to the wound of amfortas  and to all wounds and maladies and the need for healing .  ,1
i was not nearly as smitten with this as many other reviewers . sure  it has a pair of lovely girls playing erotic  lesbian vampires . marianne morris and anulka d . play these two lovely sirens with razor teeth that run up to cars on a road out of the way  hitch to their home  at dusk   and invite their prey . . . sex  starved men to their boudoir . what happens there . . . well  after they disrobe and kiss each other mostly  they kill their visitors . director jose ramon larraz does have some flashes of brilliance with his camera . some scenes are quite eerie and effectively shot  but sex alone does not hold a film up  no pun intended . . . at least consciously  . there really isn  t much of a story here . we have the two girls . we are shown some inexplicable and unexplained beginning where we see them shot with pistol . why  what does it mean  why do we have the guy that stays for several days greet a guy at the hotel that insists he knows him from years ago  does that have a purpose  of course i have even more general questions like what is a couple of nice  looking girls doing as vampires in the english countryside and having a wine cellar filled with wine from the carpathians  anyway  the script is riddled with such flaws . it is also very sparse on the action outside of catch victims  wine and dine them  quite literally   and then go to bed in the crypt . the end gets going with some juicier scenes  but it is anti  climatic . there are  as i said  some effective scenes by the director . . . i particularly liked the way the girls dressed and were filmed in the woods looking for their prey . the house is also a most impressive set . and both girls are as i said very lovely . marianne morris in particular stands out  in more ways than one . for you older film fans  silent screen veteran bessie love has a brief cameo at film  s end .  ,0
a lot of the comments people have made strike me as  sorry  missing the point . kasdan wants to present life  simply  ordinary life . the conventionally structured story  where characters have insights that change their lives  and then fade out  music up  and the film is over  is absorbed into this much larger canvas . several characters in this movie have just such illuminations  and then they move on . sometimes they can hold onto their insights  sometimes they can  t  and that  s the way life really is . in other words  kasdan jettisons conventional dramatic structure in favor of an exploration of the the ongoingness of life  there is no happy ending  only an eventual ending and everything before that is still in process  still always up for grabs  and  if you absolutely insist on a theme  an exploration of the role of the miraculous in our lives . what is a miracle  well  life itself  for a start . then add in all the random incidents and cross  connections that make up a life  or several interconnected lives  and you have miracles by the bucketful . kasdan underscores this theme lightly  rather than insisting on it  and bolsters it in various ways  most memorably by the device  right in the center of the film  of having mac and his wife  lying in bed  each dreaming their own dreams  but as well showing  later on in the film  how those dreams have the power  within the film  to shape reality . this is not a film with an easy or obvious message . you just have to let it play out in front of you  and then let it sit in your mind for a few days  a month  a few years  and see what it has wrought there . this is  without a doubt  kasdan  s best film  his most mature  his most humane . a major meditation on life from one of our most gifted writers and directors . the tragedy is  of course  that he has not been allowed to work for a number of years now  mostly due to studio constraints around  dreamcatcher .  hopefully we haven  t heard the last from larry kasdan . a great film from a great artist . keep in mind that art does not have to rationalize itself completely in order to succeed .  ,1

what a shame that alan clarke has to be associated with this tripe . that doesn  t rule it out however get a group of lads and some stellas together and have a whale of a time running this one again and again and rolling around on the floor in tears of laughter . great wasted night stuff . al hunter homes in on a well publicised theme of the late   s  that hooligans were well organised and not really interested in the football itself  often with respectable jobs  estate agent     . but how clarke can convince us that any of the two  bit actors straying from other tv productions of low quality  grange hill  or soon to go on to poor quality drama  eastenders  can for a nanosecond make us believe that they are tough football thugs is laughable . are we really to believe that the icf  on whom of course the drama is based  would ever go to another town to fight with just six blokes   br    br   the icf would crowd out tube stations and the like with hundreds . andy nicholls  scally needs to be read before even contemplating a story of this nature . the acting is appalling and provides most of the laughs  oldman is so camp it is unbelievable . most of them look as though they should be in a bubble of bath of mr matey . a true inspiration to anyone with a digital video camera who thinks they can make a flick  go for it .  ,0
this movie was one of the worst i  ve ever seen . pure drivel . how anyone could develop a connection with the heroine  or have empathy for her  is beyond me . i felt i was watching a case history of a schizoid individual with borderline personality disorder . just terrible .  br    br   in its most generous light  this can be seen as an attempt at producing and  art  film  except i could not  for the life of me  find any art in it at all .  br    br   if this woman had lived in todays  world  she would have been whisked off to a mental institution and given a couple of days treatment with anti  psychotic medications . that  or simply allowed to roam the streets and become a bag woman . why other characters in this movie found anything redeeming in her  and tried to aid her in her quest to become an actress  speaks more to their pathology than any convincing characteristics she had that made her worth that effort .  ,0
simply but imaginatively filmed studio  set performance short  a perfect match of music and images that defines the very coolness of cool and the hipness of hip . the precise visual and musical arrangements give the lie to its claim to be a record of a jam session what it is  is a pop video  every bit as stylised and knowing as that implies  and all the better for it . among the very best music films ever made  and almost certainly the most cinematic . these cats are solid gone  daddy  o . . .  ,1
the movie actually has a fairly good story  but gets bogged down in several key places . it  s almost as if the director threw the movie together without taking the time to make some essential cuts in the film . dennis quaid does a fairly decent job in his role . . . but something is clearly missing from several key scenes .  br    br   this  .  hour movie could have been reduced to about a  hour movie . and probably would have been a much better film had it not had the feel as if it was thrown together .  br    br    ,1

i took my    year  old daughter to see nancy drew over the weekend and found myself thoroughly entertained . first off  it was clean  and i mean by my standards . the majority of kids  movies today are full of crude toilet humor and gross  out jokes to elicit cheap laughter from the pre  teen crowd . nancy drew is smarter than that  however  and the humor is subtle and clever .  br    br   the title role is played with a refreshing vivaciousness by emma roberts  who is perky and polite without ever becoming annoying . unlike the brady bunch movie  where the anachronistic characters are jeered and ridiculed  nancy  s style is treated with respect and dignity . it  s a great moment when the la  style  conscious  girls with their paris hilton streetwalker attire are dismissed by the boutique owner  while nancy  in her penny loafers and homemade butterick pattern dress  is embraced . this movie shuns the we  need  to  enlighten  this  wholesome  girl tack so many hollywood movies take . nancy remains true to herself and her values throughout .  br    br   the mystery is just tense enough at times to be engaging . there were several suspenseful moments where my daughter nervously grabbed my arm  but there were no gratuitous shock scenes . it  s all based on tension and mood and is a lot of fun . the supporting cast is good  particularly marshall bell as the creepy caretaker . there are some great cameos by eddie jemison  chris kattan and bruce willis and many moments that will make adults smile .  br    br   this film deserves better ratings than some have given it . not only was i glad not to be dragged to yet another computer animated film where talking animals burp and pass gas all over the place  but i was also very entertained . had i been there without a child  i still would  ve enjoyed the movie . this is one dvd that will have my daughter  s name on it under the christmas tree .  ,1
a wonderful film version of the best  selling book and smash broadway play about the lives of sadie and bessie delany  two african  american sisters who both lived over the age of    and told their story of witnessing a century of american history . ruby dee and diahann carroll give very good performances as bessie and sadie  respectively . amy madigan also is good as amy hill hearth  the white new york times reporter whose article about the sisters launched the book  etc . many of the flashback scenes and even many of the present  day ones are very powerful  if not quite as inspirational as in the book . that is the only real drawback  combined with the fact that certain aspects of the story are not presented clearly  such as the inter  racial background of the sisters  mother and why their father was so stern . but other than that  a very well  done  excellently performed  powerful movie .  ,1

to communicate in film essential things of life  like what is life  does it have a meaning   is sheer impossible . of course possible answers to these questions are demonstrated in every film  story   but communication needs a direct appeal to consciousness . this happens if the input from the senses overrules the  input  from our mind  i . e . our thoughts . few directors know how to communicate essential things . tarkovsky  is one . his  stalker  shows images of existence  communicates life as it shows itself and yet escapes your mind . i think de zee and de graaff do the same .  ,1
rarely do i see a film that i am totally engrossed with this was one of them . it had good acting  dialogue  plot  and the scenery was beautiful . i laughed out loud many times  especially the scene dealing with the kitchen raid . the slapstick comedy performed by the lunkhead hired hand had me one the floor  but i admit that i am a sucker for slapstick . the story dealt with a group of people in their    s coming back to a summer camp that they had attended   years previously . it was a farewell week of camping  as the place would be closed down permanently at the end of the season . as adults the camp looked different  and they felt differently about it and each other . i recommend this funny  moving movie to all .  br    br    ,1

columbo movies have been going downhill for years  this year it may have reached the bottom . peter falk gives the same uninspired performance and comes over as creepy in this movie . as is usual in this series  crime scene protocols are unheard of so plausibility is always lacking . brenda vaccaro chews the scenery and pulls pantomime faces and andrew stephens is a pretty unconvincing lady  s man .  his faint  though  was a hoot   the script was by the numbers and its delivery patronising . they should never have brought columbo into the nineties  just left us all with one or two happy memories of clever plots  better scripts and sharp characterisations .  ,0

adrian has just gone out of the asylum  being rich and with no parents  his life seems empty . one day  he meets gonzalo  a poor boy whom mother is prostitute . desperate for earning some money  gonzalo helps adrian to search about his life and who where his parents . this is a movie from a new director  and it is perfectly clear in most of the film scenes not correctly directed  dialogues a little forced  some incoherences in the script . . . anyway  the ending is unexpectedly well done  well  just a little  and that saves a little the film . actors are known and with great quality  nevertheless  they are not inspired enough to make the movie interesting all of them have done better papers in other film . the film results boring and probably you will spend most of the time thinking how much time will pass until it ends . of course there are lots of worse films  but  sure  there are many many better ones .  ,0
i had never heard of this film prior to seeing it  i wondered if it was an independent film  and i was correct  but with a good cast i decided to chance it . basically drifter michael williams  nicolas cage  is in the town red rock  wyoming  looking for a job  and meeting bar owner wayne brown  pleasantville  s j . t . walsh  he is given a large sum of money  mistaken for a hit  man he has hired to kill his unfaithful wife suzanne  lara flynn boyle  . he does not correct him  takes the money  and goes to warn suzanne  and after she makes him a counteroffer  he decides he needs to leave . when wayne knows his real identity  he chases michael shooting a big gun  until he gets in a car with lyle from dallas  dennis hopper  . but things get complicated when michael realises lyle is the hit  man he was mistaken for  and he makes a quick retreat . he goes back to suzanne  and knowing they are both in danger  they plan to leave town together  and add another complication by falling for each other . before they leave however  suzanne insists they go and steal a big amount money in the safe . of course things aren  t going to go smoothly  and wayne and lyle catch up to them  and lyle forces them and now tied  up wayne to go and get the buried money . in the end  lyle and wayne both get what they deserve  michael and suzanne do get on a moving train together  but it is obvious she cares more about the money  and she gets what she deserves too . also starring craig reay as jim  vance johnson as mr . johnson  timothy carhart as deputy matt greytack  dwight yoakam as truck driver and robert apel as howard . the performances  apart from maybe a lame boyle  are all fine and dandy  and it has got quite a good film noir feel for a black comedy thriller . very good   ,1
 . . . but i  ve seen better too .  br    br   the story here is predictable   a film crew trying to film a horror movie in a place where murders occurred . three guesses what happens . this isn  t a total bomb   the cast is fairly good with pros john ireland  faith domergue and john carradine giving the best performances . it  s reasonably well  made   for a low budget film . just don  t expect any nudity  swearing  blood or gore  the film has a very mild pg rating  . i was never totally bored   it  s ok viewing on a quiet night . i saw it on video   it was a horrible print   very dark and some scenes were impossible to see . still i didn  t hate it and it does have a cool ending which surprised me   basically nothing happens up till then so it catches you off guard . worth seeing but only if you  re a horror film completest .  ,0
this low  budget erotic thriller that has some good points  but a lot more bad one . the plot revolves around a female lawyer trying to clear her lover who is accused of murdering his wife . being a soft  core film  that entails her going undercover at a strip club and having sex with possible suspects . as plots go for this type of genre  not to bad . the script is okay  and the story makes enough sense for someone up at  am watching this not to notice too many plot holes . but everything else in the film seems cheap . the lead actors aren  t that bad  but pretty much all the supporting ones are unbelievably bad  one girl seems like she is drunk and  or high  . the cinematography is badly lit  with everything looking grainy and ugly . the sound is so terrible that you can barely hear what people are saying . the worst thing in this movie is the reason you  re watching it  the sex . the reason people watch these things is for hot sex scenes featuring really hot girls in red shoe diary situations . the sex scenes aren  t hot they  re sleazy  shot in that porno style where everything is just a master shot of two people going at it . the woman also look like they are refuges from a porn shoot . i  m not trying to be rude or mean here  but they all have that breast implants and a burned out  weathered look . even the title   deviant obsession   sounds like a hardcore flick . not that i don  t have anything against porn  in fact i love it . but i want my soft  core and my hard  core separate . what ever happened to actresses like shannon tweed  jacqueline lovell  shannon whirry and kim dawson  women that could act and who would totally arouse you  and what happened to b erotic thrillers like body chemistry  nighteyes and even stripped to kill . sure  none of these where masterpieces  but at least they felt like movies . plus  they were pushing the envelope  going beyond hollywood  s relatively prude stance on sex  sexual obsessions and perversions . now they just make hard  core films without the hard  core sex .  ,1
this is not a horror film  but a boring sex movie . a very bad movie  to be avoided by any serious horror fan . no plot  awful acting and annoying music . if you only watch the trailer you will know enough . . . it  s a shame that such thing is available on vhs or video while there are so many good movies unavailable . if you like vampires try the hammer productions or the italian gothic from mario bava and antonio margheriti instead . those are masterpieces if you compare this with this trash . rating  even    is too much  and believe me  i am not the only one with this opinion .  ,0
there are   comments as i add mine to this list and there is barely a criticism . this is because this film is terrific entertainment and has a bit of everything in it .  br    br   it is perhaps a little frightening for younger children but my    year old son thought it was fantastic in every way from the action  to the humour and even to the beautiful music score .  br    br   i buy dvds only when i know that they are going to be regularly watched and now that this is finally available in the uk  i will certainly be adding it to my collection .  ,1
   minutes in the beautiful christina galbo tries to escape the isolated boarding school she  s brought to at the beginning of the movie . is she running from some kind of fate too horrible to contemplate  a monster  black  gloved killer  or supernatural evil  no  she  s running from a bunch of bullies . for the other   minutes that follow  various figures walk around the school in the dark holding candelabras and looking alarmed or distraught  which doesn  t say much in itself perhaps because great movies have been made about just that but if you  re going to have characters walking around corridors and staircases you better be alain resnais or you better know how to light that staircase in bright apple reds and purples like mario bava . we know a killer stalks the perimeters of the school but his body count is pitiful and sparse and in the absence of the visceral horrors one expects to find in the giallo  we get no sense of sinister mysteries  unspeakable secrets festering behind a facade of order and piety and rightness which is the kind of movie la residencia wants to be but doesn  t quite know how to do it . we know something is off because girls are reported missing but we never get the foreboding mysterious atmosphere that says  something is seriously f  cking wrong here  man  . when serrador tries to comment on the sexual repression of the female students  he does so with quick  cutting hysterics and detail closeups of eyes and parted lips while high pitched  this  is  shocking  music blares in the background . none of the aetherial beauty and longing of picnic at hanging rock to be found here . it  s all a bit clumsy and aimless  with no real sense of urgency or direction . a number of people are presented as suspects but there  s little reason to care for the identity of a killer that goes unnoticed by the characters inside the movie . i like the first kill  the image of a knife hitting target superimposed over the anguished face of the victim as a lullaby chimes in the background  but the rest is too inconsequential for my taste . i have to say serrador did much better with the killing children and paranoia du soleil of who can kill a child   ,0
what happens when an army of wetbacks  towelheads  and godless eastern european commies gather their forces south of the border  gary busey kicks their butts  of course . another laughable example of reagan  era cultural fallout  bulletproof wastes a decent supporting cast headed by l q jones and thalmus rasulala .  ,0
i  ve seen a lot of tv movies in my time as a student  the majority the normal waste of time that us television throws out . this one  however  was well crafted and plotted and had a very nice twist at the end . having only seen richard dean anderson in macgyver and stargate i was surprised with his excellent performance rather than the rather gamut of expressions from a  b that he normally gives . it was a pleasant surprise to see daphne zuniga after quite a long time dating back to the fly ii . also nice to see robert guillaumme in a leading role again . i can  t say that i ever take jane leeves seriously after her benny hill days but she just about managed to cope well in her role . all in all a highly recommended film .  ,1
this film is justly famous as one of the most horrible examples of propaganda ever produced . the insistent equation of jews with disease is simply  br    br   pathological  and even worse it almost becomes believable for brief seconds  br    br   through its sheer repetition . the fact that something this crude works  even  br    br   briefly  is an object lesson in itself . you have to have a strong stomach and a firm grip on yourself to sit through this  and i wouldn  t recommend trying unless you have a good reason .  ,0
  st the good news . the   d is spectacularly well done  and they don  t go for the gotcha gimmicks . the film is based on the true story of the high point in human history  and even features one of the actual participants in that story buzz aldrin .  br    br   and now the meat of the matter it  s about flies  for krissakes  flies with big  googy human eyes  true  but flies nonetheless . remember when i likened the  underworld  movies to rats vs . cockroaches  that wasn  t intended as praise  and i never dreamed anyone would take it literally . this one  s got even less empathy going for it . baby maggots  ugh . in one of those odd confluences of hollywood groupthink  this flik was evidently on the drawing boards at the same time as  space chimps   also about critters in space .  br    br   go rent  apollo    and see a   rated movie about the real space program  rip  .  ,0
yeah  it  s a bit of a silly film  so if you are looking for an oscar performance  forget this one . . . . . . but  if you love john candy  s humor  this is a must  see . we lost john candy before he made enough of his great brand of comedy  and he is only better in one movie planes  trains   automobiles  with steve martin  . excellent supporting performance by eugene levy  perhaps his best work ever as the hot  headed sal dipasquale . also good acting by richard libertini  alley mills  pat hingle . you must see this obscure and out  of  print film if you are a john candy or eugene levy fan .  ,1
although this film put davis on the map due to her brilliantly intense performance as the illiterate guttersnipe waitress  prostitute mildred rogers  this film is strangely unsatisfying to me as a whole . the acting is indeed fine in most every respect . what i cannot fathom for the life of me is just how or why phillip  a sensitive  well  bred young man would take the constant abuse this tramp constantly dishes out towards him i find his naive tolerance quite ridiculously unbelievable in certain respects . yes  i know he is a sensitive club  footed  introverted intellectual . but davis is such a venomous witch that nobody that cultured would tolerate her attitude or actions and make it believable . davis is astounding in her role yes  she may go overboard in her histrionics now and then  but it  s a vividly creative portrayal any which way you look at it . too bad she wasn  t playing a gangster  s moll . her character would have been completely believable as a tramp among low  lifes   ,1
joel schumacher made a heck of a choice when he decided on this cast and this script . the story is well written and well laid out  and this entirely new cast of   or   central characters was absolutely brilliant . it seemed that there were   leads  and about a half dozen supporting  and by far this is the best thing about the movie  the fresh young faces of tomorrow . it has been a long time since hollywood has touched the controversial vietnam war films  which says something for the  story that needed to be told   as stated by schumacher  and tigerland lands in that handful of top war movies period . yet it can not be labeled as a war movie because it seemed to be based more on the human spirit of bozz and the others . i think anyone who just wants to see a good film with out all of the special fx  but just good  gritty drama should go see tigerland  obviously shumachers best works in the past  years .  ,1
some spoilers  br    br   i was pleasantly surprised to find the harsh criticisms  acting  dated dialogue  unclear storyline  unfounded . belafonte is great as a brandoesque  menacing  swearing spirit who must earn his wings but is realistically ill  equipped from his past life to do so . he learns too late how empty his hustling  materialistic life was without love . mostel is likewise great as an anguished man with his dying wife fanny . in spite of his prayers for a miracle  his bitterness prevents him from accepting  or believing  in one . the two social worlds the characters represent alternately collide and complement the other  the result being hilarious and touchingly sad .  br    br   the perplexing ending is actually quite consistent with the rest of the film . after looking everywhere for belafonte  mostel looks up to see a falling feather  and he frantically reaches for it as if he  s finally willing to believe in angels and miracles . but belafonte wasn  t allowed to finish his miracle  either to restore fanny  s health or mostel  s faith   so he never got his wings . the feather floats tauntingly out of mostel  s grasp  a metaphor for both men  s live it  s too late and you don  t get a second chance . like  it  s a wonderful life   this movie is magical  wonderful  funny  but terribly tragic .  ,1
i don  t know the stars  or modern chinese teenage music  but i do know a thoroughly entertaining movie when i see one .  br    br   kung fu dunk is pure hollywood in its values  it  s played for laughs  for love  and is a great blend of kung fu and basketball .  br    br   everybody looks like they had a lot of fun making this  the production values are excellent  and modern china looks glossier than los angeles here .  br    br   the plot of the abandoned orphan who grows up in a kung fu school only to be kicked out and then discover superstardom as a basketball play  and love and more etc  is great  this is fresh  fun  and immensely entertaining .  br    br   with great action and good dialogue this is one simply to enjoy  for all ages  and for our money was one of the best family movies we  re seen in a long time .  br    br   please ignore the negative reviews and give dunk a chance  we were really glad we did  a good sports comedy movie .  ,1
i could not believe how awful this film was i rarely watch commercial tv  but thought  well  diane keaton is always worth watching  . i stand corrected . everyone involved should be hanging their heads in shame .  br    br   i realize there are not a lot of great roles for women of a certain age  but the script to this was so inept  clichd and baffling that i am surprised it ever got into development or that ms . keaton thought she could make a silk purse out of this sow  s ear . none of the characters had a shred of believability and were so incredibly unlikeable . the acting looked like exercises in a beginning class  i stared in open  mouthed horror through most of this wondering  what were they thinking   . very  very sad that it has come to this . don  t waste your time .  ,0
rated e  br    br   i never actually owned a nintendo   but i have played one many times . in my opinion along with conkers bad fur day  super mario   is one of the best video games for the nintendo   system . i have played this game plenty of times and its good every time . if you have an n   and don  t have this game you should try to find it . the original super mario bros games were side scrolling video games but super mario   has a  d mario in a nice  d environment . the game is sort of weird but there is plenty of things you can do in the game . you play as super mario and once again you must rescue princess and the    power stars from bowzer . now you can do it in a  d environment . super mario   is a very fun and good n   game and i recommend it .  br    br         ,1

believe me  i like horror movies . i like science fiction movies . i like independent films . and  i like low  budget  b movies .  br    br   sometimes  i even like bad acting  plodding scripts  wooden lines  improbably situations  and the like . however  i did not like christmas on mars .  br    br   it just doesn  t work on so many levels . for all the reasons listed previously  and many more . that includes the nonsensical  blatant use of images of female genitalia . and the many allusions to male genitalia  in a very freudian way .  br    br   i am convinced this is purely from ineptitude . as opposed to some attempt at doing something really different . i mean any movie that takes years to film  just cannot keep up the level of congruity and focus demanded by modern audiences .  br    br   i had hoped that the whole movie was just a dream or hallucination by the main character . however  sadly  it was meant to have happened  as we saw things unfold on screen .  br    br   about the only kindness that i can express  is that the image at the end was stupendous . if this had been used at the beginning  instead of the end  it could have allowed the film to take off where     ended . . .  br    br   to bad they didn  t try that instead . i just don  t understand what was so important about this film that it even had to be made . was it the plot  surely  it couldn  t be . was it the characters  i doubt it i mean  i could live without knowing about ed   . was it the dialog  emphatically  no . the music  perhaps  but more  likely the unvarnished ego of the principals needing to be stroked .  br    br   much better efforts have died on the cutting room floor .  ,0
i watched the unrated version of this film and realised about   minutes into it that i was never getting my time back . i persevered to the end hoping that the dialogue would improve  the martial arts would look realistic eventually  the special fx would actually look special . i was so wrong . i love horror  i am a complete gore hound . i number some of the eighties splatter flicks amongst the greats of the film world . this however was not made in the eighties  if this film had come out in the early eighties the fax could be forgiven for looking so bad . it wasn  t so it hasn  t got that defence . the dialogue is terrible with so many bad lines i was wincing at the writing rather than squirming at torture . i don  t like hostel  never have  i thought it was over rated  over hyped and i felt nothing for the protagonists  however it shines as a beacon to greatness next to this garbage . the back of the cover for live feed promised a twist you would never see coming  i  m still waiting for the twist that was promised .  ,0

a woman  sylvia kristel  seduces a   year old boy  eric brown  . they have sex . . . but it  s all tied into some stupid plot or something .  br    br   easily one of the most disturbing sex comedies ever . does anyone realize this movie is making light of child molestation  i suppose it  s ok cause it  s a teenage boy   if we had one with a man seducing a teenage girl there would  rightfully  be outrage . sorry  but having it done to a boy doesn  t excuse it . it  s still sick . i realize brown was of age  he was actually   when this was made  but he looks   . i just find it disturbing that some people find this ok .  br    br   plot aside the acting sucks  kristel is beautiful   but can  t act brown is easily one of the worst child actors i  ve ever seen  and the constant nudity gets boring and isn  t even remotely erotic .  br    br   i saw this drivel at a theatre back in     . i was   and with my   year old cousin  who could easily pass for    . he wanted to see it   i didn  t but i decided what the heck  we got in and i actually bought tickets for three teenage boys who were obviously underage . my cousin thought is was boring and the three other kids left halfway through  let me make this clear   three teenage boys left a movie with tons of female nudity  that should give you an idea of how bad this is . i  m surprised this was ever released . a  all the way .  ,0

this was a strange kind of film about a low  lifes in new york city and centering around a main character  the title name  played by brad pitt  who thinks he   s a ricky nelson  type musician  except he has no real talent .  br    br   it  s kind of fun to watch until a profane tough new york city  type woman with horrible accent enters the picture and takes over . that ruined the film for me . it must have been catherine keener  who usually plays tough and garbage  mouthed women .  br    br   the hairdo on pitt  an exaggerated pompadour  was fun to look at . i can picture johnny depp playing this role better . one last note it odd to hear a film made in      other than woody allen  s  with just mono sound .  ,0
this movie could have been so much better with a script rewrite . not that i expect a great deal of plausibility in movies  but you  d think that even the homeless and urban  dwelling jack mason would question why a group of experienced hunters would want to hire him as a hunting guide . and upon reaching the hunting grounds  poor ice  t plays his part as if he is actually going to lead these men through woods he  s never seen before .  br    br   and how does jack mason find thomas burns back in seattle   br    br   i  m assuming this movie was based on richard connell  s short story  the most dangerous game .  a few years ago i showed this movie to a class of  th grade students after they read the story . i reedited the movie  cutting out all the pointless scenes and all the profanity . it ended up being   minutes long .  ,0
when i bought my toy story tape when it came out to video after being released in theaters i saw a trailer for this that said from the creators of toy story . as soon as i saw that i knew this was gonna be a good feature  i was right  a bug  s life like toy story is great story  great characters and great animation . my favorite characters are dim the rhino beetle voiced by brad garrett and hemlich the caterpillar voiced by the late pixar storyman joe ranft . my favorite scene is when slim the walking stick  david hyde pierce  lifts up hemlich trying to distract the bird and hemlich  s like you hoo mr . early bird . how about a nice tasting worm on a stick and slim  s like i  m going to snap  i  m going to snap  i just died laughing at that scene . being a big fan of insects i think a bug  s life is my favorite pixar even though i know a lot of people consider it the worst pixar film ever  i don  t know how you could hate a pixar film  i think they  re all pretty good films  good job pixar   ,1
i will be short . . . this film is an embarrassment to everyone except its cinematographer . the very fact that it is a critique of the sex tourism industry seems valid until we are  treated  to a lingering dance scene . the plot is ridiculous no one except the most ardent fan of bad horror will get anything out of it . and for the love of god please stop saying this film is a tale of innocence lost or even of female empowerment because it is quite clearly not  childish fumbling lesbians  what the hell   . this was by far the worst film at the edinburgh festival  that i saw anyway   someone even collapsed halfway through the film probably because they couldn  t take any more of it . this may seem like an overly critical rant but i genuinely cannot find a redeeming feature of this film except for perhaps if you take it as pure comedy . in short this film is best watched on a cocktail of class a drugs .  ,0
eddie murphy really made me laugh my ass off on this hbo stand up comedy show . i love his impressions of mr . t  ed norton and ralph cramden of  the honeymooners   elvis presley  and michael jackson too . the ice cream man  goony goo goo  is also funny . i saw this for the first time when it came out in     . i laughed so hard  i almost fell off my chair . i still think this is very funny .  br    br   eddie murphy  when he was on  saturday night live   made me laugh so hard  he is one of the best people to come out of  saturday night live  .  eddie murphy delirious  is his best stand up performance next to  eddie murphy raw  .  br    br   i give  eddie murphy delirious   thumbs up and      stars .  ,1

first of all i need to say that i  m portuguese and it  s not usual to me spend my time watching portuguese movies  probably one each year or even none . . .  br    br   . . . and the reason is the almost generalized idea between the portuguese people that the national pictures are awful  really close to the worst ever made  however  in the last decade  it starts to surprises me when we get back the funny of the   s when  leo da estrela  e  costa do castelo  were among the worlds best of their time  with movies like  pulsao zero  or  sorte nula   both from director fernando fragata and also with some actors and music in common .  br    br   this one is also good  not of the same kind because it isn  t a true comedy in fact it  s officially a drama  a woman  s drama the has some unexpected funny parts  cause of humorous characters or hilarious things that happen to them  like the hypothetical travel to the caribbean just to get laid .  br    br   the plot works and can surprise us a few times the actors are fine  the locations regular as the score but the truth is that it all make sense  then we can count it as a nice effort for the national cinema  that seems to be starting from the ashes as the phoenix .  br    br   if you want to watch a portuguese movie  surely you can take better option  but it stills one to be measured .  ,1
any true wrestling fan would have to consider this wrestlemania to be one of  if not the best of all time . it was packed with excitement and surprises . one of the greatest matches of all time was between shawn michaels and steve austin with special guest ref mike tyson . the show that michaels put on was unbelievable  especially considering the shape that his back was in and that this was his last match .  ,1
i am not a parent  neither am i a male . but i was able to identify with every character  s heartaches and pains .  br    br   this is a movie teenagers should watch . maybe that way they will start appreciating the value of family again . i  m sorry for those that don  t understand the value of love  family and friendship .  br    br   it was very interesting to watch patrick duffy in a different role than that of bobby ewing . and it is great to see a   year old ben affleck giving his best in a moving and sincere performance . he showed at an early age  that he is capable of heartfelt drama . he should be offered more serious roles . note hollywoodland . . . his first serious role in years and he went out and won best actor at the venice festival in     .  br    br   this movie can be appreciated by people of all ages . maybe shouldn  t be watched by children under   because they might get scared that the same may happen to their families  but i recommend it to the entire family .  br    br   i bought this movie on dvd and have watched it with friends many times . because it portrays the values that are important in life .  ,1
i guess when  beat street  made a national appearance   flashdance  came at the same time . the problem with  flashdance  is that there was only one break dancing scene and the rest was jazz dance and ballet . that was one of the reasons why  beat street  was better . the only movie that could rival  beat street  seems to be  footloose   because both movies focused on how dance had been used by people to express their utmost feelings .  br    br   the break  dance scenes in  beat street  come just before the middle and at the end of the flick . and i loved all of them . almost all of the break tricks were featured in the break jam scenes the jackhammer  the flares  the head spins  the suicide sit  the crazy legs  the mortal  the forward flip  the figure four    almost everything .  br    br   like  the warriors    beat street  does have violence related to the gang life in the hip hop world . . . but in a much less violent way than the former . the only major fight scene in  beat street  was when graffiti artist ramon  which in the movie was abbreviated as  ramo   is chased by a rival gang member on the new york city subway tracks . . . . . fighting each other on the third rail and both dying by electrocution on that rail . well  although that chase scene ended tragically  it was better that they died that way than having blood exploding from a gang gunshot .  br    br   most of the gang stuff in the flick was graffiti related to the hip  hop culture  and rap music . a lot of rap music appeared in the flick  because hip  hop members used rap music as a diversion to the negative aspects of gang life . even the theme song of the movie  which closed the curtain to the flick  was not just an homage to hip  hop culture   it also was an homage to the death of ramon .  br    br   by the way  during the dance scene called  tango  tango   i guess the female drummer in the pit orchestra conducted by actress rae dawn chong was sheila e . making a cameo appearance .  ,1

  br    br   back in his youth  the old man had wanted to marry his first cousin  but his family forbid it . many decades later  the old man has raised three children  two boys and one girl   and allows his son and daughter to marry and have children . soon  the sister is bored with brother    and jumps in the bed of brother   .  br    br   one might think that the three siblings are stuck somewhere on a remote island . but no   they are upper class europeans going to college and busy in the social world .  br    br   never do we see a flirtatious moment between any non  related female and the two brothers . never do we see any flirtatious moment between any non  related male and the one sister . all flirtatious moments are shared between only between the brothers and sister .  br    br   the weakest part of gladiator was the incest thing . the young emperor commodus would have hundreds of slave girls and a city full of marriage  minded girls all over him  but no   he only wanted his sister  if movie incest is your cup of tea  then sunshine will  slowly  thrill you to no end .  ,0
i first saw this movie about  years ago and i was expecting something funny  similar to cb  . i was blown away . i was on the floor laughing my butt off this movie is so great . way better than cb   the characters  the songs  the plot  everything . top notch independent film that was given  two thumbs up  by siskel and egbert  and if two old white guys can understand the humour in this flick  you know it  s good  .  ,1
following a sitcom plot is so mindlessly easy that having her character simultaneously operate both within and without the context the rest of the cast inhabit is the kind of experimentalism that sitcoms could really use . the supporting characters ground the show in a sitcom reality which provides a contextual counterpoint to sarah  s erratic persona which  beyond general insensitivity  has no specific recurring traits for behavioural expectations to be based on  making her less a character than a canvas to be repainted in every episode if not scene . sarah  s ability to see everything from an outside perspective enables her to parody aspects of social behaviour that are subtle enough to usually go unnoticed . every time she speaks it  s like a self  contained  second skit . she overemotes a lot  demonstrating the countless things a smile or change in vocal pitch can signify  but never sticks with one idea long enough for you to get comfortable and form expectations that will be satisfied . this may be the most creative  original and experimental tv program ever .  ,1
what keeps us going  or at least what i feel the writer wanted us to keep us glued at an early point is our desire to know whether martinaud has done the dirty deed . without spoiling so much  of course there is a red herring and a twist . but then we discover that this is the story of martinaud  s imperfections and his difficulty in coping . when there is the revelation  we begin to sympathize and pity him because as the story progresses we are made to think he is the sick  perverted pedophiliac that we  re predisposed to have in mind . one of those things he has to cope with is the distant gap he and his wife have even though they live on the same roof . these problems of course are given their denouement in the film  s shocking finale .  br    br   this movie demands your patience and it has certainly tried those of restless teenagers sitting at the rear . they were heckling obviously because they aren  t partial to  central location  films . although there is a bit of travelling  when we get to the woods and the beach . and we realize that gallien isn  t as clever as we are made to think he is .  br    br   the inquisitor is     ,1
think pierce brosnan and you think suave  dapper  intelligent james bond . in this movie  brosnan plays against type  and has lots of fun doing so  as does the audience  . this is a film about a hired assassin who befriends a harried businessman . . . and it works   br    br   this is a fun movie  with very good scenes  a riveting  on  the  edge brosnan and a good  compliant  off   the  edge kinnear have some good lines  . my only cavil is that hope davis  playing the oh  so  tolerant wife   can i see your gun    doesn  t appear more often she could have been a marvellous foil to these men .  br    br   this movie is like a matador it plays with the audience  while  going for a kill  . the ending is awesome because a storyline  with a positive moral   emerges this is a frenetic  frantic and fun movie  which does deserve a wide audience .  ,1
the story concerns a genealogy researcher  mel harris  who is hired by her estee lauder  like cosmetic queen aunt . her aunt  by marriage we are left to presume  is trying to track down her long lost family in europe . all they have to go on is a photo of a young girl standing by an ornate music box . the researcher heads to europe and conducts her search in places like milan  budapest  and vienna . the scenery is the real thing and is actually shot on location  unlike a murder  she wrote where jessica is supposed to be visiting a far  flung locale and lansbury never left burbank  . anyway  she meets a young man who is also searching to solve a family mystery of his own and they team up to track down clues and menace bad guys . the dialogue  particularly the romantic dialogue  is terrible . i watched this because of the scenery but the script was so bad that i stayed on just to see if it would get worse . it did . acting was also off . i can see why mel harris  s career never really took off after thirtysomething  but she is adequate  seems too old for her co  star though  . but  the supporting players are straight out of the community playhouse . i also lost count of how many times they say  budapest  to each other . yes  it is pronounced bood  a  phesht . we know  okay  i realized halfway into the film that this had to be one of those harlequin movies and sure enough it is . guess that says it all .  ,0
i can find very little thats good to say about this film . i am sure the idea and script looked good on paper but the filmography and acting i am afraid is not the standards i would expect from some very talented people . i would doubt that this features highly in their cv filmography . michael caine appeared wooden at times in his role as the doctor  and at no time no did i actually believe in his character . the plot was unbelievable especially with regard to the victims son . some of the scenes were very reminiscent of other films  that at times i wondered if it was actually a spoof thriller . the lighting at times was dark and this added to the feeling of watching a low budget movie with some big named stars  wondering why i bothered to watch it at all .  ,0
okay . this has been a favourite since i was   . granted  i don  t watch it multiple times a year anymore  but . . . this is not a movie for an older generation who want a deeper meaning or some brilliant message . this movie is fun . it  s pretty dated  almost passe  but parker posey is so brilliant that it  s unbelievable . if you want to be charmed by a    s breakfast at tiffany  s  attended    s raves  or love parker  this movie is for you . otherwise  don  t bother .  ,1
i went to a prescreening of this film and was shocked how cheesy it was . it was a combination of every horror  thriller clich  trying to comment on many things including pedophilia  satan worship  undercover cops  affairs  religion . . . and it was a mess . the acting was pretty washboard the kid and the jesus dude were alright  but apart from them . . . . anyways . i admire the effort  though slightly failed  on the attempt at showing the christian people in a different way . . . even though they did that  the way it presented the gospel was a bit stock and kiddish . but then again  it may have to be since he was talking to a little kid . . . no . actually  i  ve decided it  s just all around bad . music . . . oh my gosh . . . horrible . . . toooo over  dramatic . okay . i felt bad for the people who made this movie at the premier it seemed like a poor student project . i  m going to stop ranting about this now and say bottom line  go see this movie if you want to waste an hour and fifty minutes of your life on crap . there you go .  ,0
why do people who do not know what a particular time in the past was like feel the need to try to define that time for others  replace woodstock with the civil war and the apollo moon  landing with the titanic sinking and you  ve got as realistic a flick as this formulaic soap opera populated entirely by low  life trash . is this what kids who were too young to be allowed to go to woodstock and who failed grade school composition do   i  ll show those old meanies  i  ll put out my own movie and prove that you don  t have to know nuttin about your topic to still make money   yeah  we already know that . the one thing watching this film did for me was to give me a little insight into underclass thinking . the next time i see a slut in a bar who looks like diane lane  i  m running the other way . it  s child abuse to let parents that worthless raise kids . it  s audience abuse to simply stick woodstock and the moonlanding into a flick as if that ipso facto means the film portrays     .  ,0
i thought the original of this film was quaint and charming as well as having me sitting on the edge of my seat trying to figure it out .  br    br   since i had already seen the original  when i saw this on sci fi channel  i don  t know if this remake was deliberately made for sci fi  i knew what it was within the first few minutes . since i like richard burgi as a character actor  i wanted to see how he would pull it off .  br    br   the writers  producers etc  modernized the film a bit by trying to explain the plight of the  aliens   they could no longer reproduce their own kind and needed help  using the same pseudo science that has been crammed in our ears in the    s . maybe it added a bit of polish to the film  or not .  br    br   this film . film  this production takes on a more sinister edge than the original did  the original ended with a confrontation between the young woman and the alien and an understanding of sorts took place  although no resolution of the alien  s problem .  br    br   i sort of remember that in this remake  the woman became rather hostile towards the burgi  alien  i think it could have ended better . but the ending is just the ending  and the yarn is a swell yarn  being of the basic     science fiction pulp stock . many great science fiction stories were written in the    s and some of them even made it to film .  br    br   this is a swell thing to watch on like a rainy day or something . i rate it highly cos of all the remakes of old    s sci fi  this one came off well . i actually enjoyed this quite a bit .  br    br   but if anyone really wants to see this story told well  i suggest the original     version with tom tyron and gloria talbott  directed by gene fowler jr .  ,1
this movie was horrible .  br    br   they didn  t develop any of the characters at all and the storyline was played out horribly . it was a definite sleeper . you  d expect the action scenes on a movie like this to be its strong points but d  wars surprises you with even a let down in that department .  br    br   also  the acting was just a step above the level of a low budget porno flick . and i seriously mean that .  br    br   i was actually happy to see the end credits on this one cause it was just that bad    please  whatever you do people  don  t waste your time and money on a crappy movie like d  wars .  ,0
my title ought to be enough .  br    br   it baffles me that a culture so rich in literary excellence  dumas  flaubert  balzac  maupassant  would churn out such tosh as the  nouvelle vague  cinematic movement . until the   th century  france had a great tradition of artistic lucidity and clever philosophy . but the minute you hand them a movie camera they start acting like wooohooo look how weird i can be  plot  theme  pshaw  let  s film an amusement park ride going round  round  at least this is not as bad as godard  who has an unhealthy fascination with the backs of peoples  heads . oh  la  la  quel artiste .  . no  truffaut maintains a degree of visual clarity . but so does the security camera at a quickie  mart . the two are indistinguishable .  br    br   haha  just as an aside to all you dweeby film school nerds i bet the vein is popping out the side of your neck right now . but don  t leave without reading the last sentence of my review .  br    br   anyway  if you like french literature  you will hate this . people who like this movie probably have never read any books other than the ramblings of jack kerouac or maybe  hitchhiker  s guide to the galaxy  . or maybe they have read the lyrics to the doors songs  and they think that  s profoundly moving . whatever floats yer boat . i find it ironic that this film injects some  weak  allusions to balzac  one of the finest and most meaningful writers who ever lived . nice try  truffles . but you  re nowhere near the ballpark .  br    br   avoid this film like an aids  infected syringe .  br    br   if you  re the type of person who likes to think  then stick to jean cocteau  orphee   robert bresson  pickpocket  and the japanese masters kurosawa  ikuru   kobayashi  kaidan  and teshigahara  suna no onna  .  br    br   if you  re an idiot  enjoy your truffaut  godard  and andy worhol . and for pete  s sake push that vein back in your neck . you look like a cabbage .  ,0
i can say without a shadow of a doubt that going overboard is the single worst film i have ever seen  and yes  i have seen cujo . adam sandler is an abomination as schecky moskowitz  a wannabe comedian working on a cruise liner . that  s the plot .  br    br   that  s it  nothing else in the film makes sense  it  s all over the place like a mad man  s breakfast  and not in a wacky naked gun kind of way  but more of a frustrating   throw both shoes at the t . v  kind of way . even general noriega makes an appearance  for no reason i can comprehend  it certainly wasn  t for humour  . add to the mix miss australia  who has the worst australian accent i  ve ever heared  and you have something which i won  t call the worst film ever made  because going overboard doesn  t even fit the basic definition of a film . i highly recomend seeing this film  as it will elevate the standing of every bad film you ever see . i guarantee the first thing you  ll say after seeing a bad film will be  at least it wasn  t as bad as going overboard  .  ,0
i found this film the first time when i was searching for some works in witch stphane rideau had participate  still in an extraordinary ravishment caused by the astonishingly beautiful les roseaux sauvages  in portuguese  juncos silvestres   by andr tchin . i was searching for similar movies  in the come of age line . i found then presque rien  a movie where the director sbastien lifshitz deliciously amazes us  earning a nomination by the cannes festival in     . the story is about two guys  the kind boy next door  mathieu  jrmie elkam  and cdric  stphane rideau   who meet during the summer vacations . in a land far from where he lives  mathieu spends is days at the beach with his sister . there he meets cdric  a local  with whom he starts this estival and revealing relationship  much by means of the sensual and seducer personality that stphane rideau gives his characters   in les roseaux sauvages   years younger  he still preserves the innocence of the sweet seducer  witch matures here in experience  . exemplar in directing  in the amorous sequence  in the intimate and confessing description that is made about a boys first facing his  still ambiguous  sexuality and great love . the first love  in its terrible progression ecstasy  despair . the best of the film is the best of france the fervent passion  the hot and excited rationalism  the brownish beauty  the simple and natural acceptance made by the families  although not without surprise and first anger . still  there is the beach  the luminosity  the lightness e simplicity of summer  the freshness of breeze  the surge     s melody  and the expressive eyes of an introverted elkam  hesitant  hurt  puzzled  passionate  . the sex is not avoided nor exploited  it is treated as it is  with no exhibitionist intention . in virtue of pure talent  this is a work of drama of uncommon quality  without cheap sentimentalism  showing an inevitably real image of two homosexual in their prime youth as any ordinary person  although with a social fear of rejection and shame . it is well worthy being seen  especially by those who adore french movies  although the dvd front cover is very lame  with the two actors in between tens of stars  greased with brilliantine  . a movie witch  in my opinion  deserves an      ,1
the ancient mariner is a truly classic piece of work  as the original poem was  is . the context  setting with the old mariner himself is fine  clear  and without pretense . the artistic work that accompanies the reading of the poem fits perfectly the time  period of the setting and of the work itself  carrying the audience into the period with a still  yet moving accompaniment  using excellent still  movement strategies only well conquered by the pre  mtv era producers and much less apparent in more current works .  mtv brought to television and video a static movement that races through  often irrelevant cuts  from theme to theme without forward movement and without clear relationships to theme or storyline .  the voice  intonation and vitality of redgrave  s reading brings this touching poem to life with all its fear  strife and pain . in addition  the smooth movement of the video emphasizes the cadence and occasional monotone  in this case a positive mood under the theme of the story itself  of the author  s rendition of the ancient mariner  s sad and spooky tale . this is a must for any love of classic poetry  the sea  a tall tale  that almost rings true  and a story that has left a lasting impact on our world and culture . who does not understand the meaning of an  albatross   or the concept of  water  water everywhere and not a drop to drink   a truly fine experience . thank you mr . dasilva for bringing this to life for us  never to be forgotten .  ,1
irwin allen was great . all of his tv shows had a great pilot  or first episode . the rest were basically rip offs of his other shows . a few episodes of swiss family robinson were rip offs of his older tv shows . one episode of swiss family is identical to an episode of land of the giants when a member of the party needs an appendix operation . the show was high budget and too expensive to continue . irwin lost his touch with tv shows after the   s . the acting is strong with martin milner . child stars got there starts with this show like willie ames and helen hunt . one bright spot is when irwin allen incorporates his disaster scenes like a typhoon and a volcanic eruption dubbing him the  master of disaster   ,0
seeing this movie was the most fun i  ve had at the cinema in a long time . however  i am not able to say whether this is a good or a bad film  because such simple qualifications simply cannot be applied . this picture has everything any movie could ever have . it has characteristics of a romantic comedy  a political commentary  a thriller  a drama  an action movie  a musical  and an absurdist self  conscious art film . it  s all in there  adding up to a myth .  br    br   the basic premise is about an indian couple  nandini  karishma kapoor  and shekhar  sanjay kapoor   happily living in canada  who rush to india to visit the husband  s parents after a disturbing news report . the rest of the story takes place in india  where the couple find themselves in the midst of a plot of fratricidal violence . at one point  the story borrows from  not without my baby   but to call shakti a remake of anything would be an injustice .  br    br   the ostensible story line takes a backseat to a number of astonishing interruptions  including shah rukh khan  s dream of aishwarya rai which comes as if out of another movie . in fact  the two stars are on all the posters  but they appear really late in the film  and only shah rukh ends up being a real character . yet he makes up for it with a spirited and truly unexpected performance .  br    br   karishma kapoor is the one with most work to do in this film  and she does an admirable job  having to link up the film  s twists and turns with a show of believable emotion . another notable presence is nana patekar  who plays narsimha  the tyrannical father of the husband shekhar . nana patekar dominates every scene he  s in with a scary but nuanced character .  br    br   the movie is not without its share of realism . violence is rampant  but truly disturbing in the abuse received by most of the female characters  with karishma getting soundly beaten on a number of occasions . at times  this violence is clearly disturbing but ultimately it becomes surreal as every dramatic sequence is usually followed by such comic and spectacular turns that the overall effect is nothing but cathartic .  br    br   i have seen a share of bollywood releases  and the mixing of genres and incredible plot resolutions are certainly their norm . but  shakti  raises the bar by absorbing an even greater masala without becoming ridiculous . it is a film that achieves the grandeur of a shakespearian tragedy  where the audience of the rabble and royalty is equally entertained . it is pure  gratuitous cinema  and the director krishna vamsi must have had a dream of a good time by throwing in every trick in the book . perhaps  the all  important message of violence begetting violence and the inspiring extents of motherly love were not the thoughts on my mind  but i came out of watching  shakti  exhilarated . making movies can be the most fun in the world   ,1
brilliant use of overstated technicolor illustrates the optimistic extremes of present day christmas ceremonies . the voyeuristic element during the scenes  santa  pedro summarize society  s behavior peering through a telescope  is unique  and obviously jean  luc godard  although he was subtle  stole this theme in his film  pierrot le  fou   . highly recommended   ,1
as the front cover says  the hamlet of our time  for our time  .  br    br   i had to study this filmed version of hamlet directly after watching keneth branagh  s version and it was truly a disappointing experience .  br    br   this version takes a different approach to several aspects of the play including sexuality one very very homosexual osric and an interesting interaction between hamlet and ophelia . i think for the time     s  this was a very well done version of hamlet but cannot compare to branagh  s complete version .  br    br   just a note . . . i found the video at my local video store  in australia  and i  m actually looking for a keneth branagh dvd to buy if such a thing even exists . if anyone knows of one please tell me .  ,0

brilliant adaptation of the largely interior monologues of leopold bloom  stephen dedalus  and molly bloom by joseph strick in recreating the endearing portrait of dublin on june         bloomsday  a day to be celebrated  double entendre intended  bravo director strick  screenwriter haines  as well as casting director and cinematographer in creating this masterpiece . gunter grass  novel  the tin drum filmed by volker schlndorff       is another fine film adaptation of interior monologue which i favorably compare with strick  s film .  br    br   while there are clearly recognized dublin landmarks in the original novel and in the film  there are also recognizable characters  although with different names in the novel . for example  buck mulligan with whom dedalus lives turns out to be a then prominent dublin surgeon .  br    br   this film for all of its excellence is made even richer by additional viewings .  br    br   brian invinoveritas  aol . com   june      ,1
it takes a very special kind of person to make a movie that is so wretched  beguiling  disgusting and repulsive  but make it in a way that also makes it brilliant and the quintessence of personal cinematic liberation . crispin glover  in all of his  out there  antics and predispositions  truly made something that is unique . in a world that has become starkly partisan  this film seems to evade the standard lines of creativity and art and effectively startle everyone .  br    br   right off the bat  the film takes on a rather distant paradigm  if there really is a model at all  and initially shapes it with the likes of shirley temple in front of a swastika and naked women pleasuring a man with cerebral palsy . it  s rather shocking stuff  but if you had the opportunity for the qa sessions after the screenings  it clearly opens up a bag of worms that leaves you wondering whether this is art or just the lowest common denominator . in either guise  you sense the tremor that this film will ultimately cause . it will never be accepted  not even by the supposed auteurs of the world who boringly speak about the human condition . you may not like it  but it is certainly something worth watching .  ,1
i resisted seeing this movie and i understand why it was not a big hit in theatres .  october sky  feels and looks oh so familiar . and it is . all plot contrivances and emotions have been explored before in other films   and possibly even better . but despite it  s familiarity and resistance to all formulas hollywood  this movie is winning and likeable at every turn .  br    br   sputnik is the inspiration for this journey of the heart  mind and soul . just as the characters from steven sondheim  s musical merrily we roll along stood agape atop their apartment roof hoping it would launch their new generation   what do you call it  you call it a miracle .    sputnik has a similar affect on the young rocket boys of this true tale . while jaded townsfolk of their      s coal town dismiss the event  homer hickham sees sputnik as his ticket out of a life in the mines .  br    br   masterful direction and casting make the journey of rocket boy homer and his pals seem fresh and new . especially affecting are subplots concerning homer  s ailing young school teacher . remarkable restraint is shown in depicting their delicate relationship . also remarkable is the father  son supblot that anchors the film . perfectly played all around . even homer  s mom gets her moment without cliche or intrusion . her ultimatum to her husband is both dignified and heatbreaking .  myrtle beach  says it all .  br    br   a major video chain i despise has a sign next to this film stating that you  ll love this film or they  ll refund your money . for once  i agree with them . you  ll never look at the october sky quite the same again .  br    br    ,1
years ago a movie going friend and i went to see a horror film that we thought would be good because it starred john cassavetes . for the uninitiated  john cassavettes was an actor  screen writer and director  married to actress gena rowlands   nominated for oscars three times  who wrote and directed a variety of good low  budget films using his income as an actor to keep himself afloat . up until seeing the incubus  we did not understand that john cassavetes income was made from any movie that was offered to him . had we known what the film was about before seeing it we may have avoided altogether . but we did not walk out . at the time  my friend and i jokingly indicated it was the worst movie ever made . now frankly  this is not true . i have seen many poorly made films on friday nights on cinemax  did i just say that out loud   that are far worse than the incubus . almost any movie starring brian bosworth is by definition a worse movie than the incubus . certainly santa claus conquers the martians is a worse movie than the incubus . however  i have since consistently used the incubus as a threshold below which i do not want to fall . when talking to this friend about a movie i may have seen i will always remark that it was better  or worse  than the incubus .  br    br   http   thevillagevideot . blogspot . com   ,0
undoubtedly one of the great john ford  s masterpieces  young mr . lincoln went practically unnoticed at the time of its initial release  no wonder because the year was     when many of the greatest movies of the whole cinema history had been released  including the most mythical western in the history of the genre  john ford  s milestone stagecoach and many others  such as gone with the wind  the wizard of oz  mr . smith goes to washington which took the oscar in the only category young mr . lincoln was nominated for  which is original screenplay .  br    br   it continued to be the most underrated ford  s film for many years ahead destined to gradually fade away in the shadow of other john ford  s masterpieces  but by the end of the     s american and european film critics and historians took a hold of a note written by legendary russian director sergei eisenstein about the young mr . lincoln where he praised it and acknowledged that if he would only have had an opportunity to direct any american film ever made till then  it would be definitely john ford  s young mr . lincoln . impressed by such an undoubted preference from eisenstein  critics began to see the film again but only with a bit different eyes and film  s reputation has been increasing ever since .  br    br   it was far not for the first time the life of one of the most legendary american presidents was brought to the screen . right in the beginning of the     s griffith did it in his abraham lincoln and the same year as ford  s film  mgm released john cromwell  s one called abe lincoln in illinois . curiously enough both of them were based on a very successful broadway stage play released in     and written by robert sherwood .  br    br   as far as john ford  s films are concerned  we can easily find many references to the life and deeds and even death of mythical lincoln  s figure in several of director  s works  such as     the iron horse or     the prisoner of the shark island  the second one  just as young mr . lincoln  utilizes as the main musical theme the favourite lincoln  s song  dixie .  br    br   the screenplay based on a previously mentioned stage play and lincoln  s biographies was written by lamar trotti in collaboration with john ford himself  which was quite a rare thing for ford to do but final result was simply superb  a script combining elements of the play with several historical facts as well as myths and legends about the beginning of abraham lincoln  s life and law practice culminating in a hilarious but mostly heartbreaking trial scene  which is the film  s highest point and main laugh and tears generator  where lincoln defends the two young brothers accused of a murder and have to devise a manner to help their mother too when she is brought before the court as a witness and where the prosecuting attorney  played by donald meek  demands her to indicate which one of her sons actually committed the murder obviously obliging her to the making of an impossible choice of condemning to death one and letting live the other .  br    br   overall it  s a very touching  heart  warming and even funny film with simply magnificent performance from henry fonda in his supreme characterization of abraham lincoln and with overwhelming richness of other characters no matter how little or how big they are incarnated from the wonderful and intelligent screenplay and conducted by the ability of john ford  s genius at one of its best deliveries ever . a definite must see for everyone .       ,1
i rented this film out having heard of the fuss about it not being put up for an academy award  but after watching it  it  s easy to see why it didn  t . despite the beautiful photography  the film is incredibly slow moving  despite having hardly any plot .  br    br   the plot is about a young boy trying to come to terms with his parents  death in what may or may not have been an accident  the film is never clear on this   and how his grandfather used to tell him fairy stories . the fairy stories contain the only bits of interest in the plot  but they  re very short  and don  t really seem to have any point .  br    br   the first fairy story in particular concerns a boy trying to get a magical flower to his dying girlfriend to save her life  but the boy delays by tasting the flower first to make sure it is not poisonous which results in him being a few seconds too late to save his girlfriend  the grandfather then pronounces that the moral is that the boy was too impatient  but that doesn  t make any sense because it was overcaution and slowness which resulted in his failure . perfect metaphor for this film really .  br    br   the photography of skye is beautiful though  but then stardust which was released this year is another film about fairy stories filmed in skye and beautifully photographed  and it  s infinitely better than this one .  ,0
this movie was awful and an insult to the viewer . stupid script  bad casting  endless boredom .  br    br   in the usual tradition of hollywood  the government of the us is shown as always evil . the communist  sympathizer nitwits in hollywood  most of whom are as dumb as a box of rocks  love taking the lone nutcase eugene mccarthy and picturing him as the leader of a vast movement . the truth is that at the time he was considered a fringe character who was exploiting a legitimate concern about the soviet communists for political gain .  br    br   oh yeah  and the us brought over all those evil nazis . like werner vonbraun  without whom we would have no space program . he actually loved being american and became a great asset to the country .  br    br   and yet the irony is that the fools in hollywood  an uneducated lot who live a fantasy existence  still believe that the government should run everything and give us all what we want . and yet  this is the same government that they continually portray as a consummate evil in films like this .  ,0
before she went into politics or public service  glenda jackson was one of britain  s finest film actresses . this film displays her talent despite having a supporting role in a stellar cast that includes julie christie as kitty  the wife of a british royal captain who has lost his memory of the last   years  and jenny played by american ann  margret in an almost unrecognizable role as the doting sister . alan bates plays the captain who suffers from memory loss triggered by the shell shock during world war i . sir ian holm has a smaller role as the doctor treating him . you see familiar faces like sheila keith  patsy byrne  and frank finlay . you can  t help but watch glenda play a dowdy housewife and the first true love of the captain but they came from different classes . it  s not the greatest movie but it  s good to see glenda  s amazing talent . she is still a fantastic actress  comedy or drama . she makes margaret grey into a likable character and you see why a regal captain fell in love with her .  ,1
in the glory days of the   s  god rest its soul  you could turn on the great comedy central at any hour of the day and see the greatest sketch comedy show of all time saturday night live . whpat a glorious show that was  whether it was the original not  ready  for  primetime players or the second golden age of snl featuring the greats  chris farley  adam sandler  david spade . . . and then  it all went to hell . i was first exposed to madtv about a year and a half ago  and i think i must  ve passed out from shock . how could a show so terrible prevail for so long  there are so many horrible flaws . i suppose i  ll start with the writing . the writing  for most part  is terrible . it is nothing more than kindergarten bathroom humor . the cast  for the most part  is talentless . there are a few sketches i have enjoyed  such as some of ms . swan and stuart  and there are a few talents on the show such as the magnificent alex borstein . phil lamarr is a talented actor  just not as a comedian . although there a few sparse ha ha moments  they are not enough to redeem this endless line of horrible drivel populated by babbling idiots . miss this one .  ,0
peter ustinov plays an embezzler who is just getting out of prison when the film begins . as soon as he walks out the gates  he immediately begins working on a scheme to once again make a bundle by stealing  though this time he has his sights set pretty high . this is actually one of the weak points about the film  as he apparently knows nothing about computers  few did back in      but manages to become a computer genius literally overnight  yeah  right . anyway  he comes up with a scheme to impersonate a computer expert and obtain a job with a large american corporation so he can eventually embezzle a ton of cash . considering his knowledge of computers is rudimentary  it  s amazing how he puts into effect a brilliant plan and manages to infiltrate the computer system and its defenses . but  it  s a movie after all  so i was able to suspend disbelief . by the end of the film  he and his new wife  maggie smith  are able to run away with a million pounds .  br    br   at the very end  though  it gets very  very confusing and smith announces she  s managed to actually accumulate more than two million by shrewd investing in the companies that ustinov started  though she didn  t realize they were all dummy companies  . this should mean that eventually these stocks she bought were worthless . what they seem to imply  and i could be guessing wrong here  is that ustinov and his new partners quickly cashed in the stocks before this became known and the stocks would thereby then become worthless . either way  the film seems to post on a magical ending whereby no one is hurt and everyone is happy   and this just didn  t make much sense . it  s a shame  really  as the acting and most of the writing was great . karl malden  bob newhart  peter ustinov and maggie smith were just wonderful .  br    br   if i seem to have interpreted the end  let me know  as the film seemed very vague in details at the end .  ,1
there is a scene in dan in real life where the family is competing to see which sex can finish the crossword puzzle first . the answer to one of the clues is murphy  s law anything that can go wrong  will go wrong . this is exactly the case for dan burns  steve carell  the office  a columnist for the local newspaper . dan is an expert at giving advice for everyday life  yet he comes to realize that things aren  t so picture perfect in his own . dan in real life is amazing at capturing these ironies of everyday life and is successful at embracing the comedy  tragedy  and beauty of them all . besides that this movie is pretty damn hilarious .  br    br   the death of his wife forces dan to raise his three daughters all on his own . . . each daughter in their own pivotal stages in life the first one anxious to try out her drivers license  the middle one well into her teenage angst phase  and the youngest one drifting away from early childhood . things take a turn for dan when he goes to rhode island for a family reunion and stumbles across an intriguing woman in a bookstore .  br    br   her name is marie  juliette binoche  chocolat  and she is looking for a book to help her avoid awkward situations . . . which is precisely whats in store when they get thrown into the burns family household .  br    br   if you  ve seen steve carell in the office or little miss sunshine  you  d know that he is incomparable with comedic timing and a tremendously dynamic actor as well . steve carell is awesome at capturing all the emotions that come with family life the frustration and sincere compassion . the family as well as the house itself provides a warm environment for the movie that contrasts the inner turmoil that builds throughout the movie and finally bursts out in a pretty suspenseful climax . the movie only falls short in some of the predictable outcomes  yet at the same time life is made up of both irony and predictability which is an irony within itself .  br    br   dan in real life is definitely worth seeing  for the sole enjoyment of watching all the funny subtleties we often miss in everyday life  and i  ll most likely enjoy it a second time  or even a third . just  put it on my tab .   ,1

in this film  made just as the production code was being enforced  jean harlow is eadie  and patsy kelly is the wisecracking  man  chasing sidekick  kitty  . girl from missouri starts out with the girls getting on a train  with eadie making a promise to herself to earn money while looking for a millionaire husband  staying whole  some in the process . it doesn  t take her long to meet up with frank cousins   lewis stone  was the kindly doctor in grand hotel  as well as judge hardy in the  andy hardy  films .   but all is not as it seems . . . the censors must have loved harlow  s line  a girl couldn  t accept an expensive gift like that from a gentleman unless she was engaged .  later  someone says  you know we  ve never been alone together  and eadie replies  yeah  and we  re not going to be   lionel barrymore is t . r . paige  another rich  uppercrust who comes to her rescue when trouble comes looking for eadie . at one point  paige declares  you oughta scratch me off your list  i  m not a ladies man  . . . . i wonder what that line would have been just a couple years earlier before the hayes code came rolling into town . what was he really saying  carol tevis seems to be the high  pitched  baby talker  as listed in the credits on imdb . looks like she was only in showbiz from           with  munchkin  in wizard of oz being the last part she played . fun  cleancut romp as the girls chase men around the country . look for nat pendleton as the lifeguard  who was an olympic wrestler      silver medal winner  turned film star  he was in many of the dr . kildares  and would appear in four of harlow  s films .  mistaken identity  plot twists  a young franchot tone  love stories  even jean harlow in a bathing suit in  palm beach   although the outdoor scenes of downtown appear to be a backdrop .  ,1
this movie could have been very good  but comes up way short . cheesy special effects and so  so acting . i could have looked past that if the story wasn  t so lousy . if there was more of a background story  it would have been better . the plot centers around an evil druid witch who is linked to this woman who gets migraines . the movie drags on and on and never clearly explains anything  it just keeps plodding on . christopher walken has a part  but it is completely senseless  as is most of the movie . this movie had potential  but it looks like some really bad made for tv movie . i would avoid this movie .  ,0
steve carell stars as a person who you can relate to  sort of  in dan in real life  a film which i expected not to like but ended up liking it . not that the movie is laugh out loud funny it  s just that it has a big heart . we all like steve carell  this isn  t what fans of the office would expect to see from him  but you know what  i liked this movie .  br    br   carell stars as dan burns  a widowed father who  s daughters don  t really like him . one weekend  him and his daughters travel down to see his family . while there  he goes to a bookstore and falls for a woman . when he gets back to his house  he finds out that his brother mitch  played by dane cook  is dating this woman  played by juliette binoche  .  br    br   dan in real life  at times  i found a bit unbelievable . are the burns family really the kind of people who do exercises together and play board games together and do a bunch of other family things  i would highly doubt that . i don  t know any family who is like that . is that stopping me from giving it a thumbs up  no .  br    br   dan in real life    ,1
robot jox doesn  t suffer from story or bad effects . i mean  this was     if you know what i  m talking about . robocop  still used the stop animation as most of the movies did throughout the    s . if you look at your biggest blockbusters during this period  most of them did what they could with the special effects shots that was available to them at the time . it wasn  t until terminator   judgment day was released the following year that a breakthrough in technology was realized  and story boarders began to use that motive . but you  ll have fond memories of transformers  gundam wing  even power rangers  if you watch this film . the enemy robot is very menacing . it makes you not want to face the man without a really good back  up plan . and there are some great moments within this film . a traitor  spy is working within their midsts . who you think is on your side  backing you up all the way  could be the person you didn  t expect him  her to be . and that  s very troublesome to think so  don  t you agree   ,1

you know  robin williams  god bless him  is constantly shooting himself in the foot lately with all these dumb comedies he has done this decade  with perhaps the exception of  death to smoochy   which bombed when it came out but is now a cult classic  . the dramas he has made lately have been fantastic  especially  insomnia  and  one hour photo  .  the night listener   despite mediocre reviews and a quick dvd release  is among his best work  period .  br    br   this is a very chilling story  even though it doesn  t include a serial killer or anyone that physically dangerous for that matter . the concept of the film is based on an actual case of fraud that still has yet to be officially confirmed . in high school  i read an autobiography by a child named anthony godby johnson  who suffered horrific abuse and eventually contracted aids as a result . i was moved by the story until i read reports online that johnson may not actually exist . when i saw this movie  the confused feelings that robin williams so brilliantly portrayed resurfaced in my mind .  br    br   toni collette probably gives her best dramatic performance too as the ultimately sociopathic  caretaker  . her role was a far cry from those she had in movies like  little miss sunshine  . there were even times she looked into the camera where i thought she was staring right at me . it takes a good actress to play that sort of role  and it  s this understated  yet well reviewed  role that makes toni collette probably one of the best actresses of this generation not to have even been nominated for an academy award  as of      . it  s incredible that there is at least one woman in this world who is like this  and it  s scary too .  br    br   this is a good  dark film that i highly recommend . be prepared to be unsettled  though  because this movie leaves you with a strange feeling at the end .  ,1
swedish action movies have over the past few years evolved into something that imitate american hardened action movies like  heat  but with a low budget . this movie follows the same prescription as  noll tolerans  and  livvakterna  . however  it is obvious that they are trying too hard to make a cool and tough movie .  br    br   the story has been seen before  the dialogue feels artificial and the acting is very poor  especially from the main actress . the movie tries to paint a picture of hard  boiled military  like robbers with no remorse at all and a female investigator who has completely lost it with problems of the past but at the same time acts completely rational . it does not succeed very well .  br    br   the bluish  cast photo style does not seem fresh anymore  and it is not even done well in this picture . only a very few scenes actually look good . also  the sound is quite weird and it sounds like a lot of the actual dialogue is recorded afterward .  br    br   the main quality of this movie is stefan sauk  though not making a convincing portrait of a swat  team leader  has some really funny lines . also  the music is quite well .  ,0
shakespeare said that we are actors put into a great stage . but when this stage is israel the work that we interpret multiplies for ten and all the actions we do are full of a hard style . dan katzir manages to do a spectacular portrait of a part of life in tel aviv  but besides  katzir manages to penetrate into the heart of the israeli people and  this people  far from being simple prominent figures  they speak to us from the heart . katzir  s film allows israel escape from dark informative crux in which they live  and this wonderful country arises to the light as a splendid bird which is born of his ashes . it is very great for me because the reality of state of israel  which the europeans only know for the informative diaries or the newspapers  appears as a close and absolutly human reality  the reality of million people who looking for his place  exploring the whole state  the whole culture with the only aim to feel part of it . katzir constructs an absolutely wonderful documentary and he demonstrates that when a man films with passion the deepest feelings are projected with force  and these feelings cross our hearts . thank you dan for open our eyes and give us one of the most beautiful portraits of the most wonderful countries of the world .  ,1
human tornado       is in many ways a better film than it  s predecessor . the director knew what he had to work with and catered towards rudy ray moore  s limitations as an actor . it  s a fun movie that  s more technically sound and acted . the performers don  t take themselves too seriously and it seems that this time around everyone is on the joke and goes with the flow . rudy ray moore seems more relaxed in front of the camera and not as stiff like he was in dolemite .  br    br   i enjoyed the film very much and i highly recommend it . just like his first film  it  s catered towards a certain audience  i highly doubt that mr . moore was trying to broaden his audience at this point in his career  . check it out   br    br   highjly recommended .  ,1
my husband and i were intrigued by the spectacle  a strong willed southern lady with a messy personal life solves crimes for the lapd . the first season was must  see tv for us . unfortunately  the stories of her personal life in the second season became so tedious and unworthy of the strong character that we stopped watching .  br    br   my husband and i were troubled by the episode where she tries to hide from her mother the fact that she is shacked up . but the deal breaker was the episode where she hides her possible pregnancy from her boyfriend but tells her boss . why would a strong  middle aged woman do those things  the answer is she wouldn  t . additionally  my husband and i pick out the bad guy with almost perfect accuracy . it is almost always a white male or female introduced in cameo at the murder scene or in an idealized family . can  t the script writers do something original from time to time  as i mentioned  we are no longer viewers . we prefer shows that don  t betray the characters and insult our intelligence .  ,0
i remember i loved this movie when it came out . i was   years old  had a commodore   and loved to play rambo on it . i was therefore really thrilled when i got to buy this movie really cheap . i put it in my vcr and started up man this movie is really bad  sylvester stallone says like  words in the entire movie  except for that awful sentimental speech at the end   and has the same expression on his face all the way . and that stupid love thing in the middle  it  s just so amazingly predictable . i just ended up fast forwarding the entire thing and went to exchange the movie for something else .  ,0
back in the     s  wpix ran  the adventures of superman  every weekday afternoon for quite a few years . every once in a while  we  d get a treat when they would preempt neighboring shows to air  superman and the mole men .  i always looked forward to those days . watching it recently  i was surprised at just how bad it really was .  br    br   it wasn  t bad because of the special effects  or lack thereof . true  george reeves  superman costume was pretty bad  the edges of the foam padding used to make him look more imposing being plainly visible . and true  the mole men  s costumes were even worse . what was supposed to be a furry covering wouldn  t have fooled a ten year  old  since the zippers  sleeve hems and badly pilling fabric badly tailored into baggy costumes were all painfully obvious . but these were forgivable shortcomings .  br    br   no  what made it bad were the contrived plot devices . time and again  superman failed to do anything to keep the situation from deteriorating . a lynch mob is searching for the creatures  rather than round up the hysterical crowd or search for the creatures himself  he stands around explaining the dangers of the situation to lois and the pr man . the creatures are cornered  again  he stands around watching and talking but doesn  t save them until they  re shot . luke benson  the town  s rabble  rouser  shoots at him  attempted murder to any reasonable person  but superman releases the man over and over to cause more problems . superman had quite a few opportunities to nip the problem in the bud  but never once took advantage of them .  br    br   that said  both george reeves and phyllis coates played their characters well  seemingly instantly comfortable in the roles . if only they had been given a better script to work with .  ,0
a note to all of you budding film writers study this film . if your dialog reads like the dialog in this film  please shred your script and try again .  br    br   i didn  t have high expectations  but was intrigued by the description indicating there was a mystery at the christmas ornament factory . the mystery is resolved very early and the film becomes a straight romance . i almost stopped watching it at  minutes    minutes  and at the first break . my spouse  who is the hallmark  lifetime fan  gave up at the first break .  br    br   forest river is a company town  the main business is aikens ornaments  who make all manner of holiday decorations . the patriarch of the company has recently passed away  so the companies future might be in question . we soon meet noelle  who would rather be on wall street than main street  and the mysterious justin  who gets a date with noelle after a large snowman she is inflating crashes into justins car . once we meet alison aikens  doing due diligence for the board  we have our story setup .  br    br   if you can  t nail all the story arcs by the first commercial break  you haven  t seen enough of this kind of holiday film . maybe that  s a good thing .  ,0
i sought out a copy of the forest because i was watching a vh  special  i think  where are they now   and saw the video box flash across the screen during a segment on the actor corky pigeon . he played the male child ghost in this b horror horrible  but i remember him from his character freddy on the silver spoons television show . this flick  s a major letdown . there  s nothing here . it actually took me four months to watch it from start to finish . i kept stopping it in boredom  setting it aside and forgetting about it  then stumbling on it and trying once again to get through it . obviously  the angle of this film that was intended to set it apart from its counterparts was the supernatural element  the apparitions . and obviously  here  that doesn  t work . i can  t stand the male leads . i kept expecting them to look down at their palms during the longer dialogue scenes in order to read cheat lines . the situation at the beginning where the couples decide to go camping separately is awkward and plain dumb . i guess the only positive thing to say about this one is the scene where the guy falls and breaks his leg  you can see the bone sticking out of his flesh . it  s fairly good gore makeup there . man  i  m really reaching for a positive now  huh . the only other no  budget horror film on a level as bad as this one would be home sweet home .  ,0
samuel fuller is an interesting filmmaker  mainly because he had some very inconsistent politics in his films . while  shock corridor  and  the naked kiss  represented the hypocrisies and lunacy of america and  the big red one  was an effective portrait of the horrors of war   merrill  s marauders  painted war as necessary hell and  pickup on south street  is about the dangers of communist spies . all of his films make for very entertaining viewing  and even though he was often pigeonholed as a b  filmmaker  fuller was just as good as any of the major studio contractors .  pickup on south street  is no exception  and despite the dated themes  the film  making style is remarkably ahead of its time . its also a very quickly  pace  tight  and occasionally brutal film noir .  br    br   the acting across the board is fantastic . richard widmark makes for a great anti  hero and jean peters is quite sexy as a girl who works for her communist spy boyfriend . the show stealer is thlema ritter however  in an absolutely delightful performance as a police stoolie . the angles fuller employs are great  making the acting sequences all the more exciting and brutal  this is very violent for its time  . the camera continuously moves around just as tarantino and his school would do forty years later .  pickup on south street  is a great action  paced noir thriller .  shock corridor  remains my favorite fuller film  but this is a very close second .        ,1
les visiteurs  the first movie about the medieval time travelers was actually funny . i like jean reno as an actor  but there was more . there were unexpected twists  funny situations and of course plain absurdness  that would remind you a little bit of louis de funes .  br    br   now this sequel has the same characters  the same actors in great part and the same time traveling . the plot changes a little  since the characters now are supposed to be experienced time travelers . so they jump up and down in history  without paying any attention to the fact that it keeps getting absurder as you advance in the movie . the duke  jean reno  tries to keep the whole thing together with his playing  but his character has been emptied  so there  s not a lot he can do to save the film .  br    br   now the duke  s slave  helper  he has really all the attention . the movie is merely about him and his being clumsy  annoying  stupid or whatever he was supposed to be . fact is this character tries to produce the laughter from the audience  but he does not succeed . it is as if someone was telling you a really very very bad joke  you already know  but he insists on telling that joke till the end  adding details  to make your suffering a little longer .  br    br   if you liked les visiteurs  do not spoil the taste in your mouth with the sequel . if you didn  t like les visiteurs  you would never consider seeing the sequel . if you liked this sequel . . . well  i suppose you still need to see a lot of movies .  ,0

cry freedom is an excellent primer for those wanting an overview of apartheid  s cruelty in just a couple of hours . famed director richard attenborough  gandhi  is certainly no stranger to the genre  and the collaboration of the real  life mr . and mrs . woods  the main white characters in their book and in this film  lends further authenticity to cry freedom . the video now in release actually runs a little over  and a half hours since   minutes of extra footage was inserted to make it a two part tv miniseries after the film  s initial theatrical release . while the added length serves to heighten the film  s forgivable flaws uneven character development and blanket stereotyping in particular  another possible flaw  the insistence on the white characters  fate over that of the african ones  may work out as a strength . viewing crying freedom as a politically and historically educational film  as i think it should  over its artistic merits   the story is one which black africans know only too well  though the younger generation may now need to see it on film for full impact . it is the whites who have always been the film  s and the book  s target audience  hopefully driving them to change . now twelve years after the movie  s production  cry freedom is in many ways a more interesting film to watch . almost ten years after black majority rule has been at least theorically in place       s cry freedom  s ideals remain by and large unrealized . it therefore remains as imperative as ever for white south africans  particularly the younger ones who have only heard of these actions to see it  and absorb the film  s messages . in total contrast to american slavery and the jewish holocaust  s exposure  south africans  struggles have been told by a mere two or three stories cry freedom  cry the beloved country  ok  count it twice if you include the remake   and sarafina  did i miss one   . all three dramas also clumsily feature american and british actors in both the white and black roles . not one south african actor has played a major role  white  coloured  indian or black   . and yes i did miss another international south african drama  mandela and deklerk . though this  also highly recommended  biopic was released after black majority rule was instituted  mandela was played by a black american  sidney poitier  who also starred in the original s . a .  themed cry the beloved country   while the afrikaner deklerk was played by a  bald  very british michael caine  a good performance if you can dismiss that the very essence of afrikanerdom is vehement anti  british feelings . until local sabc tv and african films start dealing with their own legacy  cry freedom is about as authentic as you  ll get . as villified as the whites  particularly the afrikaners  are portrayed in the film  any observant  non  casual  visitor to south africa even now in      not to mention     when cry freedom takes place  will generally find white  s attitudes towards blacks restrained  even understated . looking at cry freedom in hindsight  it is amazing that reconciliation can take place at all  and it is . but cry freedom at time shows not much has really changed in many people  s minds yet  and that the black africans  goal to freedom and reconciliation is still ongoing . this is why if you  re a novice to the situation  cry freedom  is your best introduction .  ,1
it  s my opinion that when you decide to re  make a very good film  you should strive to do better than the original or at least give it a fresh point of view . now the     robert wise telling of shirley jackson  s remarkable novel  the haunting of hill house  is worth the price of admission even today . now fast forward to     and the re  make . i was left shaking my head and asking  why  the acting is wooden  the story unrecognizable and the whole point seems to be to replace the subtle horror of the original with as many special effects computers can generate . i had heard that this update was bad but couldn  t believe it was that bad  considering the source material . i was wrong . after watching this and saying to my wife how awful it was  she said  well they got your money   she  s right  don  t let them get yours . if there  s no profit in making lousy re  makes  maybe they  ll stop making them or come up to a higher standard that doesn  t insult their audience  ,0
i saw this film prior to joining the british army . i went through my basic training  at first difficult and then as i progressed much easier . my time was spent during the height of the troubles in ni and the cold war . there was times when i questioned myself on what i had gotten myself into  not for long  as the training would always take over and you would always react instinctively . the voice over used to display what the soldiers are thinking is spot on  though i would have added breathing and heart rate as this seems to pound in your ear drums in given situations . some years later i was in canada for a family get together . an aunty of mine who lives in the usa and is a lecturer at the columbus uni ohio had done a paper on the effects of the british army in ni . she spent some time out there researching . although an ex pat she was very anti  british . she made a bee line for me and condemned me for being a british soldier . my only answer was see the film  a long day  s dying  . it  s the closest a civilian will get to realise why a soldier does what he does . the answer is right at the end .  ,1

sometimes realism can work against the effectiveness of a film . that  s no problem here . the sets are cheesy  inside and out . the fog is ubiquitous  half disguising the shabbiness of the production . if there  s a bar  the name painted on the front window says simply   wine and spirits .  the result is a claustrophobic set of scenes . not a single shot of a city or even a fake skyline . that  s the kind of dublin this story is about  just as jack the ripper movies are about seedy  foggy  cobblestoned whitechapel . who would want it any other way  how could it have been any other way with no bankable stars  a minuscule budget  and a four  week shooting schedule  the acting follows suit   outrageously hammy on everyone  s part . sometimes  my god  it  s positively excruciating . mrs . mcphillips moaning after frankie is shot dead outside the house . victor mclaglin however delivers exactly the right kind of overdone performance . wardrobe has stuffed him into a too  small jacket so that he seems to be bursting out of it like frankenstein  s monster . his every movement seems to go a little farther than it was intended to . when he slaps his cap on his head  he bops himself on the temple . a big  blustering  blubbering baby  he seems constantly drunk . he betrays his best friend for the reward money which will take him and his would  be girl to america  not a good guy in the ordinary sense . yet we wince as he begins to spend the   pounds  more and more of it during a wild  alcoholic night  because every expensive and grandiose gesture takes him farther from his dream . i wouldn  t argue it  but i can understand why he won an oscar .  br    br   as for max steiner  s score  wow . every movement  already overdone  is not only underlined by the mickey mouse music but highlighted in glossy yellow . it shouldn  t have happened   the heavenly choirs  the endearing young charms  the minstrel boy  the gurgling tune while mclaglen drinks from the bottle . it would have been better off with no score at all .  br    br   well  how is it as a whole  dated   by any measure  but not a product of its times . that  s why i admire it . yes  the symbolism is clumsy at times . mclaglen  a real dummy  bumping his head against a hanging sign . the fog . the blind man . but what impresses me is how little of this was being tried at the time . what strikes us as overly arty today was in     something quite different from what was seen in most of the programmers being ground out at the time . if it falls short at times  it doesn  t matter . the movie was an act of courage  politically and morally as well as poetically .  the legion of decency condemned it because of a scene in a brothel .  a director  s goal should exceed his grasp  or what  s a script for  watching it now  however  in      the story is more disturbing than ever . john ford obviously sympathized with the irish rebels . they kill  but only out of what they see as necessity .   he knows too much to live . what if he goes to the tans  oh  it  s not me  self i  m thinking of but all of us  of ireland herself .   the irish are sentimentalized and sympathetic . i wonder if the jihadists in the middle east don  t use a similar logic to justify their acts of violence .  ,1
i remember seeing this one when i was seven or eight . i must have found the characters round  because they left a impression in my mind that lasted for a long time after the end of the movie . and the ending  now that  s sad  well . . . for a    year old kid .  br    br   i had the opportunity of seeing this movie again lately  and found that the plot was too simple  the character  two  dimensional . . . i guess it  s the kind of movie that you can only with the innocence of a young child . . . pity . . .  br    br   i recommend this one for all you parents with small kids . . .  i saw it in its original french version  so i cannot tell you whether the translation is good or not .   ,1
if any style of film could be called my  guilty pleasure   it  d be this generic fantasy type . guilty is the wrong word for it  though  as i  m pretty pleased to be an escapist from time to time .  stardust  is good stock fantasy  the likes of which one should expect from neil gaiman  or gaiman adaptation  as it were  . it isn  t the visual dream  scape of mirrormask  it isn  t the adult pretension of pan  s labyrinth  and it isn  t the fun  loving classic the princess bride  but it contains just what the fantasy  lover is familiarized enough with to be completely comfortable during the entire viewing . fantasy lovers should rejoice   special effects work has finally become good enough and cheap enough that this stuff is in regular production now .  br    br   the story of stardust involves a young man named tristan who  in order to gain the love and approval of the most beautiful girl in their small town of wall  goes on an adventure to retrieve a fallen star . to make things difficult  however  tristan  s fallen star is actually a woman named yvaine  and he  s not the only one looking for her . . . some witches have their greedy eyes on the immortality the star  s heart can give  and a brother  s feud over the magic kingdom leads murderous princes in her direction .  br    br   from there it  s all pretty predictable  but it involves some attractive fantasy elements  some warm  hearted commentary on the nature of love  and the best part  robert deniro as a gay pirate . on that note  deniro  s performance is spot  on . . . it  s not the excessive lisp that most actors use to portray gay people  but a surprisingly effective one from someone used to being seen as a rough  and  gruff typecast character  thus the ongoing joke surrounding his character matching deniro  s own opening up into alternate forms of acting  . deniro hasn  t been so unique to his own image since brazil  and that  s saying something .  br    br   stardust is the type of movie  perhaps  that will subsist on children  s and fantasy  lover  s shelves for a long time . i can  t say it offers anything new  but it  s not really there to . it  s actually those most familiar with it  s tropes that will enjoy it the most .  br    br     polarisdib  ,1
this is movie is very touching . i don  t care what people say about this movie  this is a very good movie . the performances by amitabh bachchan  s role has the dying father is great  because he wants to teach his son how to handle life in case something happens to him and akshay kumer was great in his role as the spoiled aditya thakur . the supporting role of shefali shetty who played the role of sumitra thakur was magnificent . priyanka chopra was good in her small role she had in the movie . ragpal yadav as the brain  dead servant and boman irani as the show  off father  in law have a very good connection and the comedy scene  s were hilarious . the direction is very good .  ,1
italian  born eleonora has inherited from her deceased lover karl  an ultra  modern and isolated house in the middle of the woods . it  s winter and she meets the mysterious caretaker leslie  who eventually ends up not only just looking after the house  but also that of eleonora  as she tries to adapt to her new surroundings and a growing attraction between the pair .  br    br   what was i expecting  a thriller indeed  but it wasn  t quite so . that  s just the advertising on the package for ya  i  m quite perplex about everything . the title  the story and the motivation . so how to classify it  well  this wooden character drama is more a enigmatically moody romance bound  story of alienation  possession and dependence twisted into a complicatedly passionate relationship of two masked individuals . co  writer  along with william dafoe  and director giada colagrande  s art  house film is just too clinical  distant and calculated with its mysteriously metaphoric story  which it leaves you questioning what does it all really mean although when its sudden conclusion materialises  you  ll thinking why should i actually care . what we go through feels aimless with ponderous exposition of dead air that focuses of insignificant details and images . sterile dialogues can contributed to many awkward developments  but more so make for an leaden experience  as it never delves deep enough . like it believes it does . the sexually salty activities filtered in just never convince and are far from erotic . they are kind of a bump in the already sluggish flow . the base of the plot makes for something interesting and fresh  but it  s never fulfilling and i thought there  ll be more to it then all of this dreary lingering . colagrande  s direction is professionally stylish and suitably gloomy to want she imagines  but everything feels like it  s in slow motion and can get caught up admiring the same views . most of the action stays at the one location the house . camera  work is potently taut  but the sullen musical score can get a bit ridiculous when it goes for some dramatically stabbing music cues that served little sense and purpose to the scenes . giada colagrande plays it sensually and william dafoe sleep walks the part . he looks dog tired  while seymour cassel  pokes his head in now and then .  br    br   just where is it heading  is anyone  s guess . well  that  s if you can wait around for it . i think i  ll give it the benefit of the doubt  as it  s definitely not what i was expecting from this indie film .  ,0
what kind of sht is this  power rangers vs freddy  it was watchable and as good as the first film in the beginning but from the part where the protagonists get super powers in theirs dreams  it started to become childish . this sht should have been rated pg or pg    rather than r . i expected to see some very mature stuff but it was only for the    of the film . the rest are for little kids . plus it  s focused too much on christianity . i know freddy  s a demon but there are many religions that have different ways to fight demons . why does it always have to be christianity  this is total orientalism and filled with white men  westerner  s superiority . don  t  watch this  show it to little kids who loves power rangers .  ,0
how can you sum up just exactly how feelgood and right and touching this film is   for several weeks this dvd leaped off the shelf at me every time i went in the store  having seen steve carrell in a couple of films previously  i didn  t want to smear my thought process of him  so i resisted and resisted  until finally i grabbed it up with a  what the hell   attitude  and how surprised was i  i just wish i had purchased it earlier . having watched it three times in two days i am still smiling at how the portrayal of a widower struggling with three daughters  yearning for that which is missing since the passing of his beloved wife  who thus meets an intriguing woman  charming her in such a profound and interesting  dare i say bookish   way  throws a whole different light onto life that makes him realize she is what he has been searching for .  br    br   the snag of that woman being his brothers girl complicates matters  which portray dan comically shy and with a heartfelt chagrin  seeing his  someone special  bringing such fun and enjoyment into the family home as well as his brothers life . you just really begin to feel for him .  br    br   then when the blind date occurs with ruthie draper  that is the turning point in marie  s estimation of dan   the look she gives him when he repeats her comment  about not liking ruthie  sheer green  eyed monster  triggering an absolutely hilarious scene as the two couples compete on the dance floor  this sequence is one of the most well  crafted as dan starts to loosen up with regard to marie .  br    br   other gut  wrenching scenes  dan returns from the book and tackle shop  confronted by his brothers  begins to describe what has just occurred . . . . when dan  s face drops it brings a sharp intake of breath    br    br   his youngest daughter lilly making the present celebrating their love for suzanne  his late wife  brings a little heartfelt warmth and a little gulp as dan realizes just what he has lost in life .  br    br   when dan plays guitar and sings at the talent show . . . . his voice cracking slightly as he reprises the song . . . . absolute gem   br    br   the acceptance of what occurs late in the film by his daughters . . . they all three love their father and want to see him happy  will not let him deny his love for marie the desperateness of dan not to fail his daughters because he is their rock  their stronghold . . . and tell him so much more than that with just a few words .  br    br   i could go on and on but i will leave it for now  maybe return and add more comments here in the near future . . . . but i will end by saying . . . .  br    br   . . . . if you want to watch a film that is just so damn good  with twists of comedy to lighten up the drama  that never feels forced or crass  that comes over as a genuine portrayal of a man discovering new life  not just with a woman but also with his extended family  then look no further .  br    br   dan in real life   out of   for such a well  rendered cinematic experience with a score by sondre lerche  that intimately takes you there throughout whilst never being intrusive  with fine performances by the ensemble cast . i cannot wait to re  watch this again    ,1
 . . . it even beats the nasty  raw  . almost twenty years old is this show and still i laughed very much when i was watching it last night . it shows eddie murphy dressed in tight red clothes  old school  and he jokes with everything from celebertis to his family . he was only    years old then and this is a must  see   br    br        ,1
just too many incidents of violence .  br    br   the film goes from one scene to another  and in nearly every one violence erupts .  br    br   now i am not one who is shocked by violence  and to me a film without a fight in it has something missing . but  please  not one after another . my reaction was not shock or horror  it was  here we go again .  there is some semblance of a story in between the scenes of violence  but two thirds of the way through the film i had switched off completely  and couldn  t wait for the end .  br    br   if this is the best the film makers can do  they should find something else to do with their miserable lives  like making shoes or delivering mail .  ,0
this movie only gets a second star because i work downtown and liked seeing it destroyed . the effects were pretty good  i hear it was the most expensive korean film ever made . being the most expensive and still absolutely horrid makes it a massive waste of money . i rented it so i won  t complain too much about what i paid  but it was a couple hours that i  ll never get back . plot holes abound . terrible acting all across the board . i do not recommend giving up the time to watch this movie  life is too short . if your friends want to watch this  run away . i can  t stress enough how bad this film was .  br    br   where the hell did the second dragon come from  why didn  t he show up sooner  how did they have rocket launchers on dinosaurs just    years ago   ,0
composed  elegant carol  marvelously played by the beautiful rebecca brooke   her nice husband eddie  likable david houseman   carol  s wacky  constantly eating best gal pal anna  delightfully essayed with infectious comic zeal by the adorable chris jordan   and anna  s hunky  amorous husband pete  a typically fine eric edwards  are a quartet of liberated swingers who enjoy having frequent group sex with each other . their usual routine gets disrupted when carol  s lonely  repressed  but still alluring widow mother jennifer  a superbly moving performance by the lovely jennifer welles  drops by for a visit . pretty soon jennifer loosens up and becomes a willing participant in the swingers  blithely pleasurable and uninhibited carnal lifestyle  with everyone except carol eager to seduce her . writer  director joe sarno concocts a sharp  engrossing and perceptive examination of suburban angst and the limitations of the whole wild  n  easy    s sexual revolution sarno turns traditional middle class mores on their heads and further spices things up with a bold and provocative mother  daughter incest subplot . moreover  sarno elicits uniformly first  rate acting from the bang  up cast welles and brooke are both exceptional  with excellent support from edwards  jordan  houseman  arlana blue as flaky new age sex therapist shandara  and erica eaton as saucy neighbor mrs . fields . better still  all the women are extremely hot and enticing welles in particular seriously steams up the screen with her exquisitely voluptuous figure and smoldering erotic presence . the sex scenes are really sizzling and fairly explicit  but never raunchy or tedious . stephen colwell  s bright  polished cinematography and jack justis  bouncy  melodic acoustic folk score are both on the money solid and effective . recommended viewing for sarno fans .  ,1
japanese indie film with humor and philosophy where the three main characters run literally almost through the entire film  chasing each other due to strange circumstances and comical coincidence . as they are running  we see what is going on in their minds and how they got where they are at the moment . the act of running is a metaphor for these down  on  their luck people  s lives . in some way  what they  re really chasing for is not what they were originally chasing  but for meaning in their lives and an escape from their personal problems and broken dreams . running makes them all feel truly alive . the big life  altering running adventure comes to an end when they accidentally get in the middle of something big  violent  and so absurd that it  s funny in a clever way . one of my favorite films of all time by genius director sabu .  ,1
it  s hard to top this movie in several ways . everything works really well here the casting  acting  script  and cinematography are all first  rate . for the moviegoer  it  s a moving  violent story of love and human redemption . for the film critic  there  s plenty of sharp technique and technical merit . there are some tactical blunders  and as has been discussed on the boards  the ending lacks realism if one is rigorously formal with the cia agent training angle . however  i took the ending as being more moving due to the fact that rather than pursue the cia agent  s pragmatic approach  creasy basically commends his soul to the ultimate without considering the consequences . like jesus himself  creasy becomes superhuman through his sacrifice  whether it actually makes pragmatic sense or not . in any case  i appreciated the fact that creasy dispenses with conventional bourgeois morality and just caps the bad guys one by one in his methodical quest for justice  which actually results in redemption both for himself and the innocent .  br    br   in any case  this film is very much worth watching if you  re at all attracted to the genre . an excellent soundtrack  great writing  flawless casting  and solid performances across the board make this a top      or better  film .  ,1
the cast is ok . the script is awkward at times  and it takes a while to figure out what the point of the movie is . i found myself looking forward to doing the dishes . the shehan bit is a cheesy statement on the war . i guess we were supposed to not notice it . . . we did . its a house  you did nothing more than kill forty five minutes . the shower part . . . huh  what was that about  literally  it is i have a client   ok you can use our shower .  yawn . the angles are trying way to hard . there was a set of woods  suddenly its gone cause you can see right through  then next it is deep and animals are dying . in the end this is a horrendous movie of boring proportions .  ,0
i just read the comments of tomreynolds     and feel i have to jump in here . i understand he doesn  t like the film  but his reasons are not evident . my feeling regarding this film is that it is not afraid to travel the darker roads of loneliness  failure  disappointment and sorrow . each of these two people  as portrayed  have plenty of reasons to be bitter and angry  yet find tenderness and comfort in each the other . only great acting could make this work without becoming an emotional quagmire  sentimental and sappy . i really became interested in these people because of their overwhelming humanity given to them by such strong performances . i have every reason to dislike jane fonda for her vietnam era actions  but personal feelings apart  she is fabulous in this role . robert deniro is superb as a man whose intelligence and goodness begins to fail him in a world indifferent to his abilities . this is the first i have seen deniro using tenderness rather than toughness to sell a character and i really like it . this film was a big surprise when i first viewed it and i look forward to seeing it again .  ,1
seriously  the fact that this show is so popular just boggles the mind . this show isn  t funny  it isn  t clever  it isn  t original  it  s just a steaming pile of bull crap . let me start with the characters . the characters are all one  dimensional morons with loud  exaggerated voices that just sound like fingernails on a blackboard . the voice acting could  ve been better . then there  s the animation . my god  it hurts my eyes just looking at it . everything is too flat  too pointy  too bright  and too candy coated . then there  s the humor  or lack thereof . it  s completely idiotic  they just take these b  grade jokes that aren  t even that funny in the first place and then repeat them to death . they also throw in some pointless potty humor which sickens me . and finally  last and least  the music . it  s just plain annoying . it sounds like it was composed on a child  s computer and generates no emotion whatsoever . i wish there was a score lower than   i really do . this show seriously needs to be canceled . it  s a show i try to avoid like the plague . whenever i hear the theme song i immediately turn the tv off . if you  ve never watched this show then don  t . watch quality programming like the simpsons or futurama .  ,0
i have seen many  many productions of the nutcracker . now perhaps i viewed this movie from the tainted point of view of a theatrical director  but i was disappointed . i  m sure people in the specific business of ballet choreography find this production impressive but from a purely theatrical perspective i found everything from design to choreography to be lackluster and unbefitting of a  motion picture  . none of the traditionally  weird  and impressive costumes looked like what they were supposed to be  i . e . the candies didn  t look like candies  the rats didn  t look like rats but rather like chocolate kisses   the acting was weak  perhaps toned down too much for the screen  and the choreography just didn  t do anything for me . this makes the entire show very satisfactory  at best   as if it were intended to not set itself apart from any other production . but remember  again  this is from the artistic perspective of a theatrical director  not a dancer or a choreographer  but a straight male theatrical director .  ,0
surviving christmas is a surprisingly funny movie especially considering the bad publicity when it was first released . ben affleck is funny as an obnoxious millionaire who pays the family that occupies his childhood home to be his family for christmas . he then drives the family crazy with overindulgence for christmas cheer . i have not been a ben affleck fan in the past  though i did like daredevil and paycheck  but here he is well cast in this role . i also like christina applegate as the daughter in the family who can  t stand affleck  s character at first . sure you can see where this movie is going but you don  t care . ignore what the critics say and rent this movie out because it is funnier than a lot of christmas movies .  ,1

imagine the plight of richard  a painter  whose real passion is flying . when we first meet him  he is seen atop a building in london wearing his home made wings . he has ripped his canvases and other works  at the height of his despair  and fashions a flying device for his jump . when he falls into the protective police contraption  he doesn  t suffer a scratch  but it lands him in front of a judge who orders him to do community service . richard  whose relationship with anne apparently ended badly  decides to relocate to a rural area where he finds a place in the country with a large barn he plans to use to construct his own plane .  br    br   richard ends up trying to help jane harchard reluctantly . she is a young woman suffering from a . l . s .  or lou gehrig  s disease and is confined to a motorized wheel chair . jane is extremely intelligent  but has a dark side and a salty vocabulary . she uses a hand held device to speak sometimes  as her speech is not clear . what jane loves to do is to lose her virginity  at any cost . jane and richard clash as they meet  but a mutual tolerance soon makes them comfortable with one another .  br    br   jane  who watches porn on her computer  has a notion for finding someone like richard gere in  american gigolo   who will  for a fee  have sex with her . when richard takes her to london  they find the right man for the job . his fee is exorbitant  but they agree . since they have no money  richard decides to rob a big bank . unfortunately  things don  t go according to plan when jane realizes that she can  t go through with what she had wanted . at the end  richard takes jane for a ride in his crudely built plane for the thrill of her life  something that brings them closer  as they find an affinity with one another .  br    br   peter greengrass directed this quirky film which presents an unusual situation . jane is clearly not the romantic heroine in mainstream films  and yet  she has such a sweet aura about her that is hard not to feel for her and what she is trying to accomplish . mr . greengrass shows an affinity richar hawkins  material he wrote for the film . the movie doesn  t try to be cute or give a rosy picture of a young woman afflicted with an incurable disease .  br    br   helena bonham carter is the main reason for watching the film . she makes a wonderful jane . on the other hand  kenneth branagh doesn  t seem too well suited for this type of comedy . somehow  he has problems of his own in the way he interprets richard . gemma jones has some good moments as anne  richard  s former love .  br    br    the theory of flight  shows a good director . no doubt peter greengrass will go to bigger and better things .  ,1
this movie was seriously awful . the acting was the worst  it was worse than a student film . super cheesy  and i think the worst actor was the old lady . at first i thought to myself  well it  s an old movie . then i remembered that that is no excuse  i  ve seen older movies with way better acting and such .  br    br   the music was terrible to . it was really choppy . the editing was poor  most of the dialog was out of sync .   br    br   overall  this movie doesn  t even deserve a  . i only watched it because i was so bored  and the movie hardly entertained me . it was just laughable . my dead grandmother  s left pinkie toe could make a better movie than this .  ,0
just a dumb old movie . first stanwyck  s son gets his foot trapped in a really dumb way  and then her husband gets his foot trapped in another really dumb way . in an effort to save him  stanwyck gets unlucky  yet again  and comes across an escaped convict . she has a chance to kill him but fails in a very dumb way . in the end her husband is saved  and stanwyck tells us through narration what the dumb message of the movie is . all  s well than ends dumb .  br    br   i could never figure out how an unattractive woman like stanwyck ever made it as a leading lady in hollywood  s glamour  oriented golden era that nose is so beautiful so photogenic the film is mercifully short  running a little over an hour . it  s as though the director sensed that he was making crap  so he thought it best to keep the crap short .  ,0
  br    br    burning paradise  is a combination of neo  shaw brothers action and ringo lam  s urban cynicism . when one watches the film  they might feel the fight scenes are only mediocre in nature but that doesn  t matter  it  s attitude and atmosphere that counts . this great film has both   always trying to be different than his contemporaries  lam gives us to traditional heroes  fong sai  yuk and hung shi  kwan  and puts them in a  raiders of the lost ark  setting . however  these are not the light  hearted comedic incarnations that you might see in a jet li movie . instead these guys fight to the death with brutal results . what makes the film even better is that anyone could die at anytime  there is no holding back . too bad  they don  t make films like this more often .  ,1
series   br    br   as the uk eagerly awaits the launch of series two of  lost   series one  which just finished showing here  did not disappoint .  br    br   a group of over forty passengers struggle to cope after their plane crash  landed into a deserted island . they pray for rescue . however  as the days turn into weeks and the survivors explore the rainforest that surrounds them  they begin to wonder whether they are alone .  br    br   admittedly  the series has a hard time keeping up the pace after the explosive pilot episodes  which hurls at the group a polar bear  a giant beastie and the possibility of others on the island . nevertheless  the series manages to pick itself up after a few episodes and is outstanding by the final episode . possibly the greatest thing about  lost  is the fact that we visit each character  s life before the crash in a series of flashbacks . this gives us more insight and  hence more suspense and excitement as the events unfold in the present .  br    br   ultimately  this show is a superb combination of drama  suspense and the supernatural it is  quite simply  unmissable .  br    br   spoilers for season  follow  br    br   series   br    br   after the cliffhanger that was the end of series  of  lost   series  begins with our protagonists delving deep into the heart of the phenomenon that is the hatch . they discover a mysterious man who has a job to do . meanwhile  michael and sawyer struggle to cope with the aftermath of what happened on the raft .  br    br   as the series progresses  the viewers will be unable to bring themselves to turn off their television set  as every episode of the series contains more twists than a curly  wurly chocolate bar  one of which introduces a whole host of new characters . with every mystery solved with  lost   five brand new ones seem to come out of the woodworks . after the    th plot twist of the series  it finally dawns on the viewer that it doesn  t actually matter whether the plane  crash survivors make it off the island . however  the stunning series finale answers just over half of those questions  despite its anti  climatic ending .  ,1

say what you want about andy milligan  but if his family was even    as deranged as the one in this film  well then i guess he could have turned out worse . unfortunately  the video print of this film contains sex scene inserts originally shot by the distributor to boost the picture  s box office appeal . several times during the film milligan  s ugly camerawork and silent film music abruptly ends  and suddenly good  looking stand  ins for milligan  s homely actors take over and start doing it to psychedelic    s guitar rock . it  s pretty easy to fast  forward through if you  re trying to pay attention to milligan  s original film  which  unfortunately  is missing quite a bit of action that was cut to make room for the added sex scenes . what remains  however  is still compelling stuff . i don  t think i  ve ever seen a more hateful mother in any film before .  ,1

 . . . when he remade broadway bill       as riding high       . recasting bing crosby as dan brooks did not help a screenplay that was  dated  in   let alone   . this sad film has entire scenes lifted from the original with many of the supporting cast repeating their roles  unless they were dead . though being older did not seem to matter to the director . nor that the cars and clothes in the background plates from     did not seem match up too     s  standards . not even  der bingel  singing can redeem this effort .  br    br   we rated both the original and the remake imdb fourstars . frank  s touch was long gone and all that was left was capra  corn . that did not stop mr . capra though . after floundering around the    s making some educational documentaries he wound up his career remaking lady for a day       as pocketful of miracles       . again a fine cast was let down on that imdb sixstar effort compared too the originals eightstars . sometimes it is better to quit while you were still ahead  right after state of the union       .  ,0
i  m a big fan of fan of film noir  and this film by otto preminger easily stands as one of the best that i  ve seen  preminger has reunited two of his stars from the hit  laura   gene tierney and dana andrews  for an entirely different sort of crime film . laura was based around love  and this film is based around hate as we watch police detective mark dixon  a copper already suffering scrutiny from his superiors for his heavy handed tactics  accidentally kill a suspect and try to pin the murder on a known criminal a man by the name of tommy scalisi . the plot is brilliantly worked  and preminger excellently balances several plot points but it all comes back down to the main moral implication surrounding our main character . the fact that the film is set in the criminal underground means that the plot is given an excellent base to work from  and director otto preminger expertly captures the sleazier side of life by showing the main characters gambling  beating one another  and their women   shooting and more  and this also helps to offset the film from the earlier  laura   which was very much set in upper class society .  br    br   the role of mark dixon gives dana andrews one of the most interesting parts of his career . here  we have a character that is difficult to like as he  s so cold  but the fact that we can understand his motives ensures that he  s easy to sympathise with  and that allows the audience the ability to plug into his plight . the character development is well timed  and as we  ve follows this character and his motivations throughout the film everything makes sense by the end . his co  star is the beautiful gene tierney  who isn  t given as much to do in this film as she was in laura a film that made tierney its linchpin . she does well with what she  s got  however  and the lead duo  s chemistry is excellent and tierney helps to complete every scene she  s in . i can  t say that this is a better film than the earlier laura that  s a hard act to follow  but this film certainly fits into the film noir formula better than preminger  s earlier film . the film also makes a good comparison piece for laura as just about everything in this film is opposite to the     movie  yet it  s all strangely familiar . highly recommended to all   ,1
this is a very light headed comedy about a wonderful family that has a son called pecker because he use to peck at his food . pecker loves to take all kinds of pictures of the people in a small suburb of baltimore  md .  and manages to get the attention of a group of photo art lovers from new york city . pecker has a cute sister who goes simply nuts over sugar and is actually an addict  taking spoonfuls of sugar from a bag . there are scenes of men showing off the lumps in their jockey  s with grinding movements and gals doing pretty much the same . it is rather hard to keep your mind out of the gutter with this film  but who cares  it is only a film to give you a few laughs at a simple picture made in     .  ,1
an inconvenient truth is as entirely simplistic and demagogic as the turgid slop created by the rabid and idiotic republicans  it meanders along intangible lines until it attempts to gorge something into your face  namely that we  ll all be dead in a few hundred years  which is already indisputable  but who cares  humans are selfish  destructive creatures  i frankly do not waste my time caring about human extinction . i  ll just call it a  natural progression  . let the apocalypse begin  but meanwhile  we have to listen to the same brazen  slanted politicians who propose another  new society   well  don  t be fooled  we  ll all still be controlled by the wealthy  by those in power and by those idiots who created the catastrophes in the first place . nothing will ever change .  br    br   al gore  whose hypocrisy is quite evident in the film  as he is being driven in a gas guzzling car all alone using a consumerist computer  he also lives on huge acres of land in a rather large mansion  the land itself was used for destructive erosive purposes including cattle  tobacco  pig farming  which accounts for methane gas traces  and who knows what else  his wealth is predicated on exploitation  greed and his investments include numerous large companies in the world with disputable records . i hardly think this man is qualified to lecture the less fortunate  but his prestige is based on his opposition to another ludicrous political party  that is all  meanwhile he emits those very same rancid characteristics that make politics and politicians so appalling . this bozo happens to be living the comfortable life and yet he  s lecturing poor people in africa about crop farming and cut and burn techniques  he travels across the world in first class seats in fuel wasting jets  uses product placed computers in the documentary  and yet he thinks everything is a  moral issue  . he  s entirely absorbed in his own deluded nightmares  he says he came to these conclusions because of the death of his sister  from tobacco induced cancer and the near death of his son by an automobile of all things  . did he fight against the tobacco companies or propose that automobiles be banned because they are dangerous hulking machines  no . everything must serve the  economy   so why is he any different  the answer is he is not .  br    br   his forlorn and exhausted attempts at humanistic philosophy are disastrous  all this while he  s being filmed in the forest or along a little river eschewing stale life affirming quotes . well mr gore  why don  t you try living like the common people then  he is a politician  plain and simple  he has a career invested in the power structure . my question is  why doesn  t he concentrate on the powerful industrial nations of the earth who are to blame for most of the complications  he doesn  t do that because it would be unwise for  investments  stocks and corporations  .  br    br   al gore gives monotonous lectures about the subject in the documentary  namely to wealthy white people in the audience  who clap on cue  while showing them graph charts  numbers and percentages  and speaking in a dreary tone  no one without a harvard  which the elites control  education can make sense out of it  but he tells us everything is going to hell . no kidding  but i think he fails to account for this problem precisely in the approach that capitalism has taken for the planet  namely that it is expendable and a waste dump . he never once mentions how industrialization has created these problems  he just wants to put mild bandages on them but not eradicate the whole oppressive system . its obvious he was spoiled  sent to the schools for elites and has the same basic temperament for politics as any other back stabbing  inconsistent dullard in washington . whoever made this propaganda  as it is in no way different than what the republicans have conceived  had only goals in mind that were directed by capitalistic impulse . that is to say  someone is going to benefit  and it seems the  new green  politicians who support venture capitalist companies who are buying up hordes of land in an attempt to develop the  new utopian future  with  new technologies  . it  s the same old story  al gore is a believer in the elitist structure  he actually believes there is a  democracy  in the us which i find very naive . if we aren  t paying wages to the oil companies  then we  ll be paying them to the wind and solar companies .  br    br   i find the speech at the end quite rancid  along the lines of something gw bush would have oozed over to the dumb downed masses  gore speaks about  people uniting together to defeat communism  in the      s  what it had to do with global warming  absolutely nothing but he attempts to get base emotions ruminating in people . with that said  he didn  t understand that communism never existed in the world  the systems in europe and ussr were merely a tyrannical form of authoritarianism and capitalism  no less different than what controls the us interests . social ecology was not even mentioned here  which is really a travesty . if you want to change the world  then one must dispose of those antiquated systems that are based on greed  exploitation and violence .  ,0
i loved this movie  chris showerman did an amazing job  not only is he an incredible actor  but he is gorgeous with an awesome physique  he did a great job on the delivery of his lines  plus transformed into george better than fraser did . a great performance for his first major roll  this movie is full of hilarious scenes that every child will love . my kids have watched this movie numerous times since we purchased the dvd the day it came out . in addition to the movie  the extras on the dvd are just as hilarious . two thumbs up on this one  i highly recommend it to everyone   ,1
a great bugs bunny cartoon from the earlier years has bugs as a performer in an window display at a local department store . after he  s done for the day the manager comes in to tell him that he  ll be transferring soon . bugs is happy to oblige into he figures out that the new job is in taxidermy . . . and that taxidermy has to do with stuffing animals . animals like say  a certain rabbit . this causes a battle of wits between the rascally rabbit and his now former employer . i found this short to be delightful and definitely one of the better ones of the early      s . it still remains as funny nearly    years later . this animated short can be seen on disc  of the looney tunes golden collection volume  .  br    br   my grade a   ,1
gabe ryan  frankie thomas  gets out of reform school and goes back to the slums . his sister  ann sheridan  does her best to keep him out of trouble  but it just seems to follow him . aside from his associations with the termite gang  gabe is followed by real  life gangsters who have a scheme to set fire to random buildings to collect the insurance . they need someone to blame for the arson  and gabe is it . it is up to the termites to work the law in their favor and give the gangsters their just desserts .  br    br   the the scene that introduces the dead end kids is really quite good . the boys wander on over to the new resident  s furniture on the street  and proceed to make it their own . they talk to each other in phoney posh accents and talk about drinking tea together bernard punsley takes a nap in a chair . the boys then proceed to start a fight with the new boy  but after he proves himself a good fighter  they ask him to join their club .  br    br   the initiation scene is rather good too  filled with mischief that seems dangerous at first  but is really rather clever and innocent .  br    br   later  when billy halop studies to become the boy mayor  he has a dream about schoolwork . this is wonderfully staged  with tiny holograms of the kids walking on his face and firing questions at him .  br    br   angels wash their faces is a great title because it plays off of the success of angels with dirty faces  and really tells what the kids are doing . notorious for bad behavior on and off the set  these boys make nice in this film . but rather than seem disingenuous  it makes for some great laughs . this is a preview of what many of the boys would become in the bowery boys series . we even get a few garbled words from leo gorcey .  ,1
i  m a huge classic film buff  but am just getting in to silent movies . a lot of silent films don  t hold my attention  but show people is a notable exception .  br    br   marion davies and william haines are simply wonderful in this picture . davies  in particular  shows a wide range as she morphs from a giggly small town girl to a starlet who takes herself a bit too seriously .  br    br   show people is a fast paced film with a fantastic array of cameos by some of the biggest stars of the silent era . the movie captured my attention immediately and i actually forgot that it was a silent film .  i know that doesn  t make much sense  but that  s what happened .  the actors are so skilled in their craft that few dialogue cards are necessary .  br    br   show people is a perfect introduction to silent films . it is a fast paced  interesting film with two of the silent era  s best stars . add in the satire of hollywood and show people should be on the  must see  list for all classic film buffs .  ,1

as a lover of bad movies  i definitely hit paydirt with this one . the plot isn  t really that bad  but there are a few instances where you really have to ask yourself  what the heck is going on here    br    br   there are many many things that make this the funniest bad movie ever . first off  rudy ray moore had gotten so fat and slow when this movie was filmed that the special effects consist of speeding up the fight scenes to double time . there are also scenes where there is a slow  motion instant replay  jumping onto a ten foot high wall  by playing falling off of it backwards   naked men walking out of huge letters  and sex that literally brings down the roof  with the cable holding up the roof catching on fire  .  br    br   of course  no rudy ray moore movie would be complete without a completely gratuitous and random comedy club scene where rudy makes fun of all the customers  interposed with people doing some odd dance . there are so many things bad about this movie  but they  re bad in an entertaining way  and if you take your eyes off the movie  you might miss another mistake .  br    br   rating     for actual value       for cheese factor       for picking out mistakes and goofs  averages out to     .  ,1
this was the first televised episode of the columbo series  although it was filmed after  death lends a hand   and it heralded one of the most successful tv series in history .  br    br   jack cassidy  who played the murderer in the series three times  enthuses smugness  arrogance and self  assuredness in equal measure here  as ken franklin  one half of a mystery writing team who hatches an elaborate plot to kill off his partner  jim ferris  played by martin milner  who decides to terminate their professional relationship  leaving franklin exposed as merely a good publicist rather than a prolific writer .  br    br   the initial murder set  up is fantastic and cassidy  s performance facilitates an arguable accolade that he was the best columbo murderer in the series .  br    br   peter falk is wonderfully understated in his role as columbo and the character  s inherent traits and oddities  which are underlined by a seeming slowness and absent  mindedness  contrast particularly well with cassidy  s character  s extreme smugness one of their early scenes together where ken franklin fabricates a motive for the killing through jim ferris  s non  existent expo  see of identifying hit  men operating in the underworld exemplifies this very well . franklin hints to columbo this potential motive and columbo  purposely or ignorantly  fails to latch on  forcing franklin to express his disappointment in a markedly patronising manner and compare him unfavourably with the detective in the books  mrs . melville .  br    br   also  noteworthy is the early directorial contribution of   year old steven spielberg . notwithstanding  some elementary inclusions of cameras shadowing the actors and actresses  he adds some stylish and elaborate touches to uphold the general professionalism of the episode . one particularly stark image is of jim feriss  s dead body lying on the settee  almost dark in the foreground  as ken franklin raises a glass to him in the background after he finishes answering a phone call to ferris  s distraught wife . i have no doubt that working to a restrictive      day schedule  spieberg  s efforts should not be underestimated .  br    br   unfortunately  the event of the second murder  necessitated by a blackmailing scheme which is plotted by a female friend of franklin  s  and ironically referred to as  sloppy  by columbo in his climatic summing up  takes the steam out of the whole thing . the cutting edge of the plot is compromised and the screen  time between falk and cassidy inexcusably lessens at this point to perhaps help the script  writer  stephen bocho  out of a tight corner  since he cannot singularly develop the story without another murder .  br    br   the climax is the most disappointing aspect of this episode . the initial banter and exchange of words between falk and cassidy is strongly and effectively executed  but it merely advertises the fact that it should have happened more in the episode . the main aggravation lies with the sealing clue  if it can be called a clue   cassidy  s character  s hitherto smugness and arrogance is amazingly expelled by a clue that really does little to imply his guilt and once this is mentioned  he capitulates in a rather unspectacular and uncharacteristic fashion .  br    br   all in all  a bold opening to the series  which inevitably advertises and foretells all that is good about columbo  and  conversely  the problems associated with such ingenuity  i . e maintaining the high standards and particularly  creating a credible and suitably intelligent ending .  ,1
if you want an undemanding and reasonably amusing hour or so  then it  s ok to watch this . it  s not all that bad  really . yeah  it  s got more lapses in logic than i care to describe here and might tax the patience of people  like myself  i have to admit  who are inclined to throw things at the tv on occasion  but it  s funny at least . just because it  s not always intentionally funny  there  s no need to let that get you down .  br    br   however  if you  ve read the book  or any of the other books by brookmyre  then you  d probably best avoid it . i  ve read them all and when i first watched this film  i despised it . i  ve trashed it in detail and at great length on another site  in fact . the tv plot bears practically no relevance at all to that of the book and served only to outrage and infuriate many faithful  and admittedly rabid  brookmyre fans .  br    br   best bit of advice . .  watch this  then read the book and only then make your comparisons and submit your judgement .  ,0
curiously  season  of the columbo series contained only three episodes and there is very little evidence of quality in at least two of the scripts  based on this outing for the  man  in  the  mac  and also  fade into murder  .  br    br   furthermore  it is not a coincidence that peter s . feibleman penned both the aforementioned scripts  incidentally he plays the part of the murdered security guard here  .  br    br   this adventure is very rarely compelling and many of the performers just look disinterested with the material . the story is rather weakly developed with some protracted periods of boring conversation .  br    br   columbo is also shadowed by a colleague here  similar to  last salute to the commodore   but the entertainment value is minimal . to add to this  celeste  s holm characterisation  which is intended to provide comedy  induces embarrassment rather than laughs .  br    br   the script wavers off to deal with the family history and the murderess does enough to gift columbo the case  though there is never a credible discussion relating to the motives of her crime .  br    br   ironically  what turns out to be  arguably  columbo  s worst adventure produces the funniest moment in the series . he quizzes a male hairdresser and has a haircut  manicure at the same time . the next  minutes are hilarious  it  s just that columbo  s hair is so perfectly groomed  then he can  t afford to pay the bill and then  when he makes enquiries at a jewellers he keeps glancing in the mirror to admire his hairstyle   br    br   sadly  this is the only decent moment from a script that looks like it has been cobbled together in ten minutes .  br    br   for columbo completionists only .  ,0
this is one irresistible great cheerful  and technically greatly made movie   br    br   the movie features some of the greatest looking sets you  ll ever see in a     s movie  even though it  s all too obvious that they are sets  rather than real place locations . often if a character would fall or shake a doorpost too aggressive  the entire set would obviously move .  br    br   the best moments of the movie were the silent  more old fashioned  slapstick kind of moments . it shows that ren clair  s true heart was at silent movie  making . the overall humor is really great in this movie . also of course the musical moments were more than great . this is a really enjoyable light and simple pleasant early french musical . though the best moments are the silent moments  that does not mean that the movie is not filled with some great humorous dialog  that gets very well delivered by the main actors  who all seemed like stage actors to me  which in this case worked extremely well for the movie its overall style and pleasant no  worries atmosphere . no wonder this worked out so well  since this movie is actually based on stage play by georges berr .  br    br   it  s a technical really great movie  with also some great innovation camera  work in it and some really great editing  that create some fast going and pleasant to watch enjoyable sequences . there is never a dull moment in this movie   br    br   ren clair was such a clever director  who knew how to build up and plan comical moments within in movies . it  s a very creative made movie  that despite its simplicity still at all times feel as a totally original and cleverly constructed movie  that never seizes to entertain .  br    br   the last half hour is especially unforgettably fun  without spoiling too much  and is really among the greatest  as well as most creative moments in early comedy film  making .  br    br   the movie is filled with some really enjoyable characters  who are of course all very stereotypical and silly and were obviously cast because of their looks . it all adds to the pleasant light comical atmosphere and cuteness of the movie .  br    br   one of the most pleasant movies you  ll ever see   br    br        ,1
now this film isn  t going to scare anyone  but it was interesting for two reasons  two big reason and a smaller one  well  that  s three reasons  isn  t it .  br    br   the first reason this is interesting is the special effects . i found them to be quite interesting and somewhat spectacular . to see the hair growing on marsha a . hunt and sybil danning was creepy  especially when they were participating in a mnage  trois .  br    br   of interest  is the fact that this marsha hunt is the famous  brown sugar  of the rolling stones song  and that she was in the infamous nude scene in the london cast of the rock musical hair .  br    br   besides the special effects  there were two other points of note in this film  and they were brought out repeatedly during the closing credits . i lost count  but i swear that sybil danning bared those points for us in the closing credits at least a dozen times and maybe many more . theyu were the most outstanding feature of the film .  ,0
the biggest surprise in this movie was the performance of daryl hannah . rather than playing the stereotypical ditzy blonde roles that she usually does she plays a street  smart  intelligent  world  weary character . she doesn  t have a huge role but she does a great job portraying lois harlan as a woman tired of  although used to  covering up for her boss  indiscretions .  ,1
first of all  don  t go into revolver expecting another snatch or lock stock  this is a different sort of gangster film .  br    br   i saw the gala the other night and this movie definitely split the audience . it  s the kind of movie where half the audience will leave thinking what was that  that was awful  and the other half will leave thinking what was that  that was cool . personally i like films that i don  t understand  i . e . mullholland drive  and usual suspects  so i enjoyed revolver .  br    br   it definitely wasn  t perfect though . i saw the big twist coming a mile away  at least part of it  and though sometimes some loose ends left unexplained is good  revolver leaves a lot of questions unexplained for no reason it seemed . also some scenes  like the animation  and the scene where sorter goes on a killing spree  actually one of my favourites   although  awesome scenes to watch  seemed to just be there because they were awesome to watch  not because they fit in with the movie .  br    br   however there were many good things too . i thought the acting was superb from all the main actors  jason stratham  ray liotta  vincent pastore  and even andre benjamin  who was a pleasant surprise  . this movie definitely kept my interest  with one great  suspenseful  action packed  scene after another . when ray liotta was being held under the table wow . . . . well you have to see it . the script was extremely well done  and the soundtrack  as with most guy ritchie films  was great .  br    br   though a step below such movies as  fight club  mullholland drive  and usual suspects  it was still an awesome fast paced  psychological  action movie  with many twists and turns and tons of scenes you will remember long after the movie is over .  ,1
this story was never among my favourites in christie  s works so i was pleasantly surprised to quite enjoy this adaptation . the mouse motif was effective if a little overdone  the bones of the story are there although more emphasis is placed on the  crime in the past  subplot . the students were all pretty much as i imagined them although its a pity they weren  t a more cosmopolitan bunch  perhaps the revised thirties setting didn  t allow for that  i thought some very daring risks were taken with the filming perhaps its because i  ve not long re  read the book but it seemed pretty obvious to me who the murderer was from their appearance in some reveal shots quite early on .  br    br   humour was much more prevalent in these early poirots . sometimes it works but i found a lot of it rather heavy handed in this episode  though i did smile at the  lemon sole  throwaway line  . altogether though  a solid entry in the series though not one of the best .  ,1
i own  home entertainment stores and i  ve seen a lot of bad movies in my time but this one was so bad it compelled me to register here and comment on it . how bad was it  let  s just say that sofia coppola deserved an oscar for her performance in godfather iii when compared to giada colagrande  s in this movie .  br    br   it was robotic and uninspired . her lover has just died one month prior to her arrival at the  rubber house  he had given her . once there  she discovers he has cheated on her throughout her relationship but none of it seems to register with her . within a day  she starts a relationship with leslie   dafoe  the caretaker of the house . even though she is married to dafoe off screen  her scenes with him were cold and unemotional .  br    br   if there was a plot  i missed it . not even willem dafoe could save this movie from the amateur  cinematic train wreck that it is .  ,0
a film so insecure the creaters perhaps hoped to milk an original film noir classic title   farewell my lovely   thinking the gullible would assume it a remake . the characters are so foul and unappealing that it deserved its cold reception when first released . time only adds to it its absurdity . having none of the guile  cinematography  desperation or despair of classic noir it relied instead on a convoluted and senseless crime plot that would have easily resulted in several arrests within hours . as if that weren  t enough it threw in an utterly sexless attempt at erotica in which at least one of the participants hadn  t bothered to bathe in several days . this only made this mess all the more painful to watch . find a good classic forties or fifties film noir instead of wasting two hours on this failure .  ,0
this movie surprised me . some things were  clicheish  and some technological elements reminded me of the movie  enemy of the state  starring will smith . but for the most part very entertaining  good mix with jamie foxx and comedian mike epps and the  wannabe thugs julio and ramundo  providing some comic relief  . this is a movie you can watch over again  say . . . some wednesday night when nothing else is on . i gave it a  for entertainment value .  ,1
i saw this little magnum opus for the first time very recently  on one of those dollar dvd  s that seem to be everywhere nowadays  and was so moved by it that i cannot contain myself . for those who have never seen this mesmerizingly miserable mexican import  and wish to view it without being prejudiced by anyone else  s jaundiced commentary  there are undoubtedly substantial spoilers in what follows . so if you are one of those reckless individuals  stop reading at once and go and watch it for yourself . if you get drunk enough in advance  you might be fortunate enough to pass out before it  s over .  br    br   begin with the premise that a man may become a werewolf after being bitten by a yeti . no one in the film ventures an explanation as to how this sort of cross  species implantation could occur  and the rest of the movie is even more hopelessly nonsensical . but pour yourself another glass of wine  or whatever you  re drinking   and let us proceed .  br    br   paul naschy  our werewolf  has the look of a man fighting a toothache  in a town where the only dentist has traded his supply of novocaine for a case of cheap whiskey  and has been drunk ever since .  ain  t he the lucky one   naschy  s facial expression never varies  whether in or out of makeup  and apparently no one gave him any coaching on how to act like a werewolf . occasionally he tries to imitate the lon chaney jr . crouch  but most of the time he simply strolls around in his black mafia shirt  like just another cool dude with a tad too much facial hair . to be fair  the makeup is actually better than the actor inside of it  but the continuity is infinitely worse . naschy  s werewolf is the only one i can think of that changes shirts twice in the middle of a prowl . he goes from black shirt to red shirt  then back to black  then back to red  then back to black  all in a single  frenzied night . interestingly enough  he always does the chaney crouch while wearing the red shirt  and the cool dude walk while wearing the black shirt . and it  s only while he is wearing the red shirt that we see much of the fury alluded to in the title . presumably there  s something about that red shirt that just brings out the animal in him .  br    br   so anyway  after being bitten by the cross  pollinating yeti  the poor schmuck returns home from tibet to learn that his wife has been sleeping with one of his students . the two illicit lovers try to murder him by adjusting the brakes on his car . he survives the wreck  and makes it home just in time for a full moon . then  after chewing up his wife and her lover  he wanders off again  and somehow manages to get himself electrocuted . but is that enough  can they let this tormented wretch rest in peace  not a chance . he is resurrected by a supposed female scientist with a hardcore s  m fetish  otherwise known as  the doctor   and definitely not a new incarnation of doctor who  . she digs him up and whisks him away to her kinky kastle  takes him down to the dungeon  chains him to the wall  and gives him a damn good flogging . presumably such a string of indignities ought to be enough to put a little fury into any wolfman .  br    br   after his two  shirted rampage  our wolfman spends most of the rest of the film wandering around the castle  trying to find a way out .  and who can blame him   in the course of his wanderings  he encounters a bewilderingly incoherent assortment of clichs  including a man dressed in medieval armor  a curiously inept phantom of the opera impersonator  supposedly the doctor  s father   and a hard  partying cadre of bondage slaves .  br    br   so what  s it all about  one may reasonably ask  one gets the vague impression that it has something to do with mind control  and involves something the doctor calls  chemotrodes .   best guess . i really have no idea how it  s spelled  if there even is such a thing .  mercifully  the experiment ends in failure  and most importantly  it ends . . . before one has time to gnaw one  s own leg off .  br    br   of course  one doesn  t really expect any sense from a film like this  but at least it ought to be good for laughs . this one isn  t . forget it  buddy . there is a creeping sort of anarchy about this film  from its patched  together  tequila  drenched ambiance to its atrocious cinematography and agonizing musical score  that defies even the most sozzled attempts to get any mst  k type laughs out of it . if it  s not even good for that  what the hell is it good for  if montezuma  s revenge could have somehow been digitally remastered and put on a dvd  it would have looked exactly like this movie .  ,0
first i  d like to excuse my bad english .  br    br   i  m not a hostel  hardcore  fan  but i liked that movie nevertheless . live feed  however  sucked big time  i have never seen a gore  movie with superb acting  but hey  who  s surprised  the acting in live feed was . . . well  not there  i  ve seen some commented this as it must have been a school project or something . okey  but not by students in media or acting school . this was no class at all  and what about the story  a really sad rip  off on hostel . and what about the gore  what about the psychopathic torture scenes that supposed to make your guts twist and leave you cold  sweating  that was the most disappointing about the hole movie  short  quick and no edge . more like an execution rather than a torture . okey  there where buckets of blood  but it didn  t even look real . the slaughtering and the violence reminded more of braindead than hostel or any of the saw  movies . and braindead was fun  okey  i laughed at live feed a couple of times  but that was more out of disappointment than out of sheer fun   br    br   so instead of wasting   minutes by watching live feed  watch anything else   ,0
i can  t say that wargames the dead code is the worst movie i  ve ever seen  as it had one or two decent moments  but i can easily say it  s the most transparent movie i  ve ever seen . not once did a plot device present itself without me guessing it    minutes in advance . there was no subtlety to anything the movie did  no intelligence evident at all behind the scenes . every spoken or typed line  s intent was so glaringly obvious it was impossible to  get into  the movie .  br    br   i found myself laughing at the horribly thought out plot line  and the bumbled attempts to reclaim the audience  far more often than i found myself enjoying the movie .  ,0
the quintessential georgian film of georgi danelia  ne goryuy       aka don  t grieve is loosely based on the novel by french writer claude tillier             mon oncle benjamin  the novel takes place in the country side of the   th century france . the great french revolution is still ahead but some of its stormy signs are present in society . benjamin  the local doctor is a soul of a local society  the educated  friendly  democratic person who often treats the poor for free . it makes him very popular with the locals but most certainly does not help with his bank account . he is in love with a beautiful manette who is also crazy about him but is being watched closely by her father who called his daughter  his small capital  and is determined to protect her virginity until the moment the marriage contract has been signed . . . i never read the book  and from description it sounds like a charming very french novel but i am fascinated with the results of moving the characters and some plot elements from   th century france to the beginning of   th century georgia  grusiya . i would think that it was danelia who came up with all the colorful memorable characters that feel so much at home in his native georgia  grusiya  the land of long and wonderful traditions  including art of making and drinking wine  rare music talent that all georgians seem to possess  very unique humor  and high code of honor . when we watched the film last night together with my husband  he said  what a great example of an art film  and i so agree with him . don  t grieve is a perfect art movie  visually beautiful  deep but funny  at times sad and philosophical but never in a preachy arrogant way but optimistic  celebrating life with all its beauty and sadness  full of interest  loving irony and understanding for its slightly eccentric but very human characters . what is the most important  the film is warm and gentle  it does not look down at its viewers as some of the art pictures do . you don  t have to be a movie buff to love it  to live with it  to smile and sigh at it  to follow the good  hearted young doctor benjamin  first role in a danelia film of famous singer and actor wachtang kikabidze with whom danelia would go on to make two more films including one of my all time favorites  mimino  on his journey through the roads and mountains of georgia . or to be a guest on one of a kind party where the friends gather to celebrate life of the old doctor levan who wanted to be a guest on his own wake  to hear what his friends have to say about him when he dies while he is still alive  and who gets to choose which color he prefers for his coffin . when i watched the film i thought that it is a sort of movie that federico fellini might have liked . i was not surprised at all to find the article about danelia where he names fellini his number one director . i also found out that according danelia  the famous soviet directors  leonid gaiday  the creator of many beloved comedies  and sergei paraszhanov  the visionary whom i don  t have to introduce loved another danelia  s film  fairy tale about american boy huck finn  sovsem propashchiy  felt and spoke negatively about don  t grieve while fellini praised it highly . i dare go a little further and just guess that perhaps maestro fellini kept in mind some images and the very aura and atmosphere of don  t grieve when he was making amrarcord in     . just a thought  because there is something essential that connects both films . both artists came back to their roots  to the places that they love deeply  to the people they remembered  loved and wanted to honor . both films have a lot of smiles through the tears . both are art movies that would get directly to the hearts of the viewers . both are masterworks .  br    br   i think i am going to add georgi danelia to the list of my favorite directors . he has made some of the brilliant pictures in my most favorite genre of dramedy  even tragicomedies that are funny and bitter sweet  poignant and subtle  earthy and uplifting  gentle and shining . when i looked up the list of the movies he has written  directed  i was amazed at the fact that he has not made a single bad film since he started back in     with the award winning story of a young boy  seryozha . many of danelia  s films are among my favorites  as i am sure they are among his legions of fans . the man behind  seryozha  sovsem propashchiy       which is an adaptation of mark twain the adventures of huckleberry finn     ya shagayu po moskve       aka walking the streets of moscow  ne goryuy       aka don  t grieve  afonya        mimino        osenniy marafon       aka autumn marathon or sad comedy which is a very fitting title for this movie as well as for the whole genre that danelia practically invented  and the cult favorite for over   years kin  dza  dza        is brilliant and deserves our true love and genuine gratitude for the unforgettable moments of cinematic happiness .  ,1
spoilers spoilers after two so  so outings   magnum force  and  the enforcer    dirty harry seems to have regained his stride in  sudden impact   a gripping thriller that wisely plays to its strengths the charisma of clint eastwood  who also directed  and a story that spends just enough time on exposition and reserves its energy for the big scenes .  br    br   for once  the case takes harry outside his native san francisco  where he  s again in trouble with his superiors for his  shoot first  ask questions later  tactics   to the hamlet of san paulo . there   warning potential spoiler  a group of lowlifes is being gruesomely murdered  one at a time  by a woman whom they gang  raped years earlier  and whose sister has been in a state of catatonia ever since the attack .  br    br   the killer is portrayed by sondra locke  and she makes the character of jennifer spencer an interesting mix of compassion and cold  bloodedness . locke  s cold eyes and frosty voice  when either trying to comfort her hospitalized sister or dispensing vengeance toward the rapists  are very effective in painting a portrait of a woman wronged whose years of suffering and rage are now beginning to bear deadly fruit .  br    br   the rapists are a despicable lot  especially the leader  who has  psycho nutjob  practically stamped on his forehead  and a lesbian who seems almost one of the guys  despite her anatomical inability to participate . the flashback scenes  while not graphically explicit  are nightmarish enough  and clearly intended to make the audience cheer for jennifer as she kills her assailants .  br    br   some will dismiss  sudden impact  as trash a mindless  manipulative revenge tale . on a certain level this is true  but it  s well  done trash . what works to the movie  s advantage is the strength of the sondra locke performance  giving us a complex character whose wounds are more visible in her paintings than in her gestures or speech . what we have here is an action movie with a point of view .  br    br   you can take or leave the idea that some wrongs deserve to be punished by any means necessary  but as the mystery behind the slayings becomes clear to harry  a realization that  wisely  is not spelled out with dialogue   he is presented with a choice   what to do about a killer whose motivations he can sympathize with but whose conduct he is bound by law to not tolerate . this makes the story more interesting than the usual dirty harry fare .  br    br   the movie  s other redeeming quality is eastwood  s direction . this is  after all  a dirty harry movie  and eastwood knows the character better than anyone else . the movie is directed with style and wit  and edited to give the action scenes a big payoff . some of the best  harry moments  in the entire series are here  including harry  s best  known line   go ahead   make my day .   br    br    sudden impact  is a movie that has the courage of its convictions in presenting a tale about a despicable crime and the brutal consequences that follow . it is also a riveting detective story  well made and well told . and it is certainly never dull . on those criteria  it succeeds tremendously .  ,1
  metamorphosis  hold a tiny bit of cult  value  simply because it was written and directed by george eastman . this italian bloke is more or less the personification of male sleaze and starred in pretty much every rancid joe d  amato production during the late    s  early    s . wouldn  t it be interesting for avid euro  cult purchasers to own the only movie directed by the guy who walked around bare  butted in  erotic nights of the living dead  all the time  i thought so  now  unlike the movies he starred in  eastman  s own  metamorphosis  is kind of disappointing in the gore  sleaze departments . there are a handful of nasty murders  cheesy monster effects and naked female bodies  a guest appearance by sleaze  queen laura gemser   on display  but it  s mainly a talkative movie . the handsome  eloquent dr . houseman is on the verge of a scientific breakthrough with his research on human dna codes when suddenly the university he works for threatens to cancel his funds . he developed a theory to decode genes and block the human ageing process  but if he doesn  t come up with detailed reports any time soon  his research will be stopped . so dr . houseman does what any intelligent scientist would do and injects the untested serum into his own veins . needless to say  and like the title implies   he slowly turns into murderous monster that actually ages much quicker  in other words  his research sucked  like the other reviewers already mentioned  this movie  borrows  a lot of ideas from david cronenberg  s  the fly   the dramatic romance sub plot included  but doesn  t add any originality from its own . the big difference is that you constantly feel connected with jeff goldblum  s character in  the fly   whereas dr . houseman becomes just another monster that needs to be destroyed as fast as possible . the rapid  ageing  syndrome aspect also reminded me of ruggero deodato  s sadly underrated giallo  phantom of death   only the protagonist in that film inherited the disease and didn  t inflict it on himself . the physical deterioration of the carriers is very similar in both films  though . few scares or excitement to discover here  instead the movie features loads of bad acting  poor lighting  lousy editing and a completely retarded climax to boot . feel free to skip this one .  ,0
  st watched            out of    dir  tobe hooper   scary  yet sadistic  which makes sense  portrayal of a relative of the marquis de sade carrying out the same sadistic acts and enjoying it that supposedly his predecessor did . this tobe hooper film really doesn  t do a whole lot different than his similar in style freddy krueger movies with the same star  freddy himself  robert englund  playing a dual role  the marquis de sade and his relative  . it is also seems like it wants to really poke at christianity but then loses that in the end much to my chagrin but leaving an inconsistent feel to the movie . could have been much worse if excesses were taken in sex and violence  but they try to keep this at a minimal despite some disgusting scenes . my final thought is why would hooper want to make this movie . it obviously took awhile to actually get distributed  then it has to be advertised gruesomely and with hooper  s name in the title to hopefully make some money on his name and his gore . it  s obvious this didn  t work .  ,0
i can see little girls enjoying this show  but calling this a family show is ridiculous . i  m amazed how well remembered it is after all these years . it  s an extremely unfunny and stupid show about widowed father of three living with his dead wife  s brother and his stupid friend from school  and others as the seasons go on . all of the plot lines generally have a really dumb lesson . in the middle of each episode somebody is mad at somebody else and each episode they make up and it ends on a light unfunny joke . as for the actors  i didn  t like them either . bob saget was painfully unfunny as the dad with the mom responsibilities . dave coulier is a one note joke   something year old that does cartoon voices and acts like a kid  and he  s horrid . john stamos was the most tolerable character but he was so clichd it was hard to watch him . the oldest girl  dj  on the show was a genuinely bad actress and showed no emotion ever . the middle girl stephanie was too clichd as the annoying little sister . the youngest girl michelle showed what bad actresses the olsen twins were . you can always tell when they are switching them off . the plot lines to too many story lines were so unrealistically stupid it  s cringe worthy . this is a  family  show that tried to replace any good substance with cuteness and love  and though those are needed for a show about a family they overdid it way too much . this will be remembered as my least favorite sit  com from the    s and    s .  br    br   my rating terrible show . tvg   mins .  ,0
i think i agree that a lot of the comments here must be fake . even if the movie is not necessarily bad its definitely below average .  dark remains  is basically a ghost movie with a premise of your own ghosts and bad emotions haunting you . the movie starts off already with  stories loosely inter  webbed which even later are not tied together . a couple loses its child which is found slashed in its bed . they move to a country house to flee their past and guess what . . . the house is haunted  kind of . from here on dark remains starts off very slow with some scary moments indeed  the first ghost appearances are nice and the flashlight sequence also worked very good  . ok  then . . . woman sees ghost of daughter  other ghosts of people died in accidents or suicides appear  man tries to solve secret of houses past  woman gets depressed  strange neighbors appear . its pretty much all been there  but the premise of it being their own emotions is nice  so you wait for the twist . there is no twist  you are just confused by a haunted house history story  the strange neighbor  a totally pointless creepy prison and the dead daughter thrown together with a photo  idea reminding me a lot of  the shutter  . the end is ridiculous because when you start and end a movie this slow and with piano music its pretty lame to include some hoards of ghosts at once which look like a zombie flick  of course just to return to slow pacing and piano music .  br    br   to make it short . . . dark remains could have been a nice scary ghost story if the script was not trying to go everywhere and arriving nowhere . too many stories mushed together which just don  t make any sense and contradict in the basic atmosphere of the movie . and beside . . . please never use abandoned prisons again . its so worn off and in this case it even makes no sense at all .  hey  there is this creepy prison uphill  lets shoot there  . i guess a lot of ingredients in dark remains were thrown in the mix like this .  ,0
this movie is  despite its  independent  status  a stupid hollywood version of a nauseating mother  daughter relationship . it wasnt that bad at first  but somewhere during the course of the movie   around the time that the daughter goes out with that guy  i think   it turns into a cheesey mother  daughter bonding movie . im sorry  but i dont know of any mothers who have that kind of relationship with their daughter . . . its probably better that way  though .  ,0
the first time i watched cold case was after it had run for about a year on danish television . at the time it came to the tv it nearly drowned in  or  other american crime shows aired roughly the same time .  br    br   i saw it and i was bored to death . the substandard actors with the self righteous faces and morals were a pain in the behind . the entire premise that so much money was given a team of investigators to solve murders dating back         or even   years seems so unlikely .  br    br   the time is also a factor as they only have      min to tell the story which means that they get a break through just in the nick of time to solve the case and bring justice to surviving family members  if they are still alive . this combined with the  personal  problems and relations of the investigators which there has to be time for leaves the show a complete lackluster .  br    br   i give it a   star rating because of the music i the end which is really the only reason for watching it . . . . which you then of course won  t do as that is too lame a reason for watching this crap .  ,0
for my opinion  the middle of the film  specially the love scene is a bit too long  but the whole time you can imagine this desert feeling . but the best  what made this film unforgettable are the great explosion pictures  their color  slowmotion and the pink floyd music are unique in filmhistory   br    br   destruction in its propper and popular form .  ,1
just watched this movie on dvd and thought the acting was very good  but the over all story left a lot to be desired . this movie has the same texture and look of panic in needle park or drugstore cowboy . hard to believe that human beings can live this type of lifestyle on the underbelly of society  in which their total existence is based on hardcore drug use  crime  violence  sex  and a total lack of self  respect for anyone or anything  including themselves .  br    br   val kilmore is outstanding in his role of  burnt  out  former porn star john holmes . the supporting cast is just as good . however  this is a bleak  dark  disturbing  and depressing film . the murder was brutal  but the daily lives of these people were brutal as well . unless you have an interest in these murders or were a  fan  of john holmes  this really isn  t a film to see . if you want to see a docu  drama on murder  truman capote  s     s in cold blood starring scott wilson and robert blake is much better .  ,1
i gotta be straight  up  i haven  t seen a film as solid as dog bite dog in quite a while . i  m a big fan of the  old  school  late   s to mid   s era catiii films  and i had been hearing that that  style  of films is making a bit of a come  back with films such as this  and herman yau  s gong tau  which as of this writing i have not yet seen . . .   so i was very interested to give some of these newer  wave catiii films a shot . did this film live up to my expectations  absolutely  but not quite in the fashion that i imagined .  br    br   the story follows a young  animalistic  resourceful and virtually unstoppable thai hit  man with a somewhat vague history who comes to hong kong to complete a  mission  . due to some bad  luck  he is quickly identified by a roguish copy  who exudes many of the same qualities as our hit  man   and is quickly apprehended and captured . this state of affairs doesn  t last long though  as the un  named assassin escapes from his captors and quickly shows the local police that he is not to be taken lightly . the hunt is on  and a cat  and  mouse game between the police and the  mad dog   as the police refer to him  ensues . along the way  mad dog is inadvertently befriended by a slow  witted young woman  and a bond forms between the two when she helps him out of a sticky situation . the ante keeps getting upped as mad dog  s only objective is to get out of hong kong and back to thailand by any means necessary  and the cops keep trying to reel him in alive . . .  br    br   i could probably write ten paragraphs about this complex and thoroughly layered film  but i don  t want to give too much away . i watched dog bite dog knowing nothing about the premise  and i think it  s the type of film that is definitely better appreciated that way . as to comparisons to the older  style catiii films . . . there are some similarities . dog bite dog has some hyper  violent moments reminiscent of the  good ol  days   but is never quite as sleazy or grimy as old  school classicks like the untold story or red to kill . where many of the older catiii films  main intention was to  shock   dog bite dog is a far more thought  out and well  rounded production  though that  s not to take anything away from those catiii films that i hold so dear . . .  . this film is far more  emotional  than it is exploitative  and as we learn more about the characters and their backgrounds  the audience begins to bond and identify with both sides . there really are no clear  cut  good  and  bad  guys  as mad dog shows moments of extreme compassion  and the cops stoop to extremely unorthodox methods to try to flesh out the killer . there  s also no nudity  sex in this film  which is a typical characteristic of the older catiii films . personally  i would compare dog bite dog more to park  s sympathy for mr . vengeance or perhaps the pang brother  s bangkok dangerous  as both of those films mixed extremely emotional overtones with strong and unflinching action and violence . again  there  s pretty much nothing that i didn  t like about this film . the acting is dead  on  the cinematography is sharp and well done  and the whole film skillfully blends several different elements successfully in a way that isn  t seen very often . is this film  and others like it . . .  the  rebirth  of the catiii film  not exactly  but it is a very solid film that  s absolutely worth checking out . . .      ,1
truly one of the most dire films i  ve ever sat through . i  ve never actually taken the time to write one of these but felt compelled to after witnessing this affront to film  making and feel somewhat aggrieved to be wasting my time on such a piece of turd to be honest . there were so many parts that infuriated me with their complete randomness and lack of sense  e . g . when would the police force ever shoot people with infectious diseases  when would hospitals ever through out such people for lack of a cure  why was the guy who spotted him spying on his wife wandering around outside in his dressing gown whilst carrying a gun as she rolled around on the bed   . also  the characterisation  as we  ve almost come to expect in such films  was awful  e . g . the way the blonde guy  i don  t remember his frickin name and don  t give a toss anyway  completely turned against his girlfriend and ran off to leave her  and i ended up wanting them all to meet grisly ends  the production was horribly disjointed and the cinematography nothing to write home about .  ,0
i  m afraid that you  ll find that the huge majority of people who rate this movie as a   are highly christian . i am not . if you are looking for a christian movie  i recommend this film . if you are looking for a good general movie  i  m afraid you  ll need to go elsewhere .  br    br   i was annoyed by the characters  and their illogical behaviour . the premise of the movie is that the teaching of morality without teaching that it was jesus who is the basis of morality is itself wrong . one scene shows the main character telling a boy that it is wrong to steal  and then the character goes on to say that it was jesus who taught us this . i find that offensive are we to believe that  thou shalt not steal  came from jesus  i suppose he wrote the ten commandments  and stealing was acceptable before that  i rented the movie from netflix . i should have realized the nature of the movie from the comments . oh well .  ,0
last november  i had a chance to see this film at the reno film festival . i have to say that it was a lot of fun . a few tech errors aside  it was a great experience . i loved the writing and acting  especially from the guy that played the lead role . there is a lot of heart in this movie  a lot of wit to . i got a chance to speak with a few of the filmmakers after it was done  and they seemed real nice . all in all the whole movie was just a positive experience  and one i  d definitely recommend . the story was entertaining and cool  as a woman i  ve been through a lot of the same problems as the lead guy  and i could really understand his problems because of it . the movie does a great job of giving us people we can sympathize with . the friends in the movie are really well written to  they are realistic . i know people like these  i only wish imy friends and i could sound as cool as these people when we talk . the whole movie is just real cool  i wish there were more films out there like it .  br    br    jayden  ,1

stan laurel and oliver hardy are the most famous comedy duo in history  and deservedly so  so i am happy to see any of their films . basically a man at a horn factory is the fourth to crack  and soon enough ollie cracks with all the horn noises . he is resting at home with stan by his side  needing quiet  and the doctor  james finlayson  phones to say he is coming over to check on ollie . after realising plumbing and electricity is muddled up by a cross  eyed repairman  the doctor comes in for a check  up  and after some tests  he recommends drinking goat  s milk and getting some sea air on the ocean . after stan practises some trumpet playing  hanging out the window by the phone cord and a car crash  he and ollie to a dock to rent a boat . they keep the boat on the dock trying to milk a goat  and stan has brought his trumpet  meanwhile  the newspaper  s front page reads that killer nick grainger  escaped convict  richard cramer  has escaped  and he sneaks onto the boys  boat while they are sleeping  and the goat chews through the boat rope  drifting out to sea . in the morning  the see their location  and the killer comes out demanding something to eat  and he spots stan and ollie making fake food  e . g . string for spaghetti  soap for cheese  belt for bacon  sponge for meatballs  and he forces them to eat it . when ollie starts choking on something  stan blows his trumpet to help  and ollie  s rage gets him punching the killer  and it keeps going till the police arrive  only to have ollie  s rage get them put in prison too . there were the tiniest moments of comedy  but it isn  t a great black and white film .  well  here  s another nice mess you  ve gotten me into   was number   on    years     quotes  and stan laurel and oliver hardy were number  on the comedians  comedian . okay   ,0
  dracula iiascension  is the story of a group of medical students who come across the body of dracula . when a mysterious stranger appears and offers the students    million to harvest the body and steal its blood for auction  it  s an offer they can hardly refuse . soon the students also find themselves relentlessly pursued by a vampire killer from the vatican   dracula iiascension  is a slightly entertaining horror film that has many flaws . the characters are one  dimensional and the acting is pretty average . there are some good gore effects like really cool double decapitation scene  but there is not enough violence for my liking . the film becomes quickly boring and forgettable and there is absolutely no suspense . so if you like modern vampire flicks give it a look . i prefer atmospheric vampire chillers from    s and early    s like  lips of blood    the brides of dracula  or  lemoraa child  s tale of supernatural  to name only a few .  out of   .  ,0
i first saw this when it was picked as a suggestion from my tivo system . i like danny elfman and thought it might be interesting . on top of that  i  m a fan of max fleischer  s work  and this started out with the look and feel of his   s cartoon . with both of those  i thought it would hold my interest . i was wrong . just a few minutes in  and i had the fast forward button down . i ran through it in about   minutes  and thought that was it .  br    br   afterwards  i read some of the other reviews here and figured i didn  t give it enough of a chance . i recorded it again and watched it through . there  s   minutes of my life i  m not getting back .  br    br   i can  t believe there aren  t more bad reviews . personally  i think it  s because it  s hard to get to the   line comment minimum . how many ways are there to say this is a waste of time   br    br   the movie comes across as though it was made by a few junior high kids ready to outrage the world and thinking they can with breasts  profanity  and puke jokes . the characters are flat . the parody of  swinging the alphabet  is lame  essentially cobbling the tune  getting through a  e  hitting the obvious profanity a  f   and then having no idea where to go . the trip through the intestines to the expected landing doesn  t work the first time  let alone the following ones .  br    br   across the board  the entire movie is what you would expect from someone trying to  out  south park  stone and parker without the ability to determine what is and isn  t funny . this might be amusing if you  re high . otherwise  it  s not .  ,0
doctor mordrid is one of those rare films that is completely under the radar  but is totally worthwhile . it really reminds me of the old serials from the   s and   s . which is why i  d have loved to see follow  up movies . . . but judging by the rest of full moon  s output there simply weren  t enough tits to satisfy the typical audience . unfortunately  thanks to a completely superfluous sacrifice scene there two too many for a family audience  which is unfortunate  because without em  this could have been a harry potter  style magicfest that kids would have eaten up . both jeffrey combs and yvette nipar are great  i wasn  t sure if ms . nipar hadn  t wandered off an a  list picture onto this film  she was very believable . no  seriously  anyway  it  s a shame they didn  t have the bucks to license dr . strange  because i think this could have been a total kiddie phenom .  ,1
way back when i was renting videos for free i picked this one up . oops the things i wanted to mention outside the summary already given were these .   someone who had a lot to do with making this movie had a strange and sick fascination for food  it was gross and unecessary .   there is some kind of a soundtrack in the background of the film that seems to be there the entire time and by the way i felt for days after viewing this trash i figure they had something subliminal going on in the track . either that or it was just traumatisingly bad or both . many times throughout the movie you can tell the writer and director did not have much experience or talent . and don  t even ask about the acting .  ,0
the fluttering of butterfly wings in the atlantic can unleash a hurricane in the pacific . according to this theory  somehow related to the chaos theory  i  m not sure exactly how   every action  no matter how small or insignificant  will start a chain reaction that can lead to big events . this small jewel of a film shows us a series of seemingly  unrelated characters  most of them in paris  whose actions will affect each others  lives .  the six  degrees  of  separation theory can be applied as well .  each story is a facet of the jewel that is this film . the acting is finely  tuned and nuanced  audrey tautou is luminous   the stories mesh plausibly  the humor is just right  and the viewer leaves the theatre nodding in agreement .  ,1

    out of    people found this comment useful  and counting . . .   br    br   people are such suckers for image and looks  as much as for the intellectually hollow  idealism  that lurks behind communism . che  s charisma and looks have as much to do with his iconic stature as the misinformation that has been spread by leftist propaganda  such as this movie  about him .  br    br   i don  t know what  s worse being captured by one of che  s murder  squads or having to sit through  hours of this typically soderberghian garbage . the question isn  t why this pet  project was made but what took them so long . by  them  i  m referring  of course  to left  wing hollywood and its  secret  love of marxist tyrants  lenin  castro . . . take your pick  . i am fascinated that it took decades for one of tinseltown  s least talented liberal directors to finally take on such an irresistibly biased propaganda project . where was oliver stone all these years  robert redford  tim robbins  warren beatty  alan pakula  george clooney  barbra streisand even  it  s a mystery . all these overrated  artists  have often indulging themselves in similar  politically one  sided projects  yet somehow che guevara  who is arguably the most popular and well  known communist  hasn  t been a film topic of theirs yet .  br    br    guerrilla  has all the hallmarks of an american truth  bending story of an epic scale there is as much factual detail to be found here as in other similar hollywood big  budget political fairy  tale bios such as  malcolm x  or  gandhi   i . e . almost none . the movie stars del toro as the famous argentinian revolutionary . nevertheless  however controversial and criminal this man  s actions may have been  one thing nobody could take away from him he was an intelligent manipulator who came from a rich family  which is why del toro fits the bill only visually . del toro may be an interesting  charismatic actor and he may resemble guevara physically  but he exudes no intellectual qualities whatsoever  hence he makes guevara come off as too primitive . casting such mediocrities as bratt  philips and franka incompetente only underlines the director  s lack of sound judgment .  br    br   the movie is to the most part extremely slow  no surprise there   and visually uninteresting . even a director as brilliant as kubrick would have carefully considered releasing a movie that goes beyond the   hour mark  so it  s quite telling that this soderbergh  who has only made one or two solid movies and early on in his career  would think that his oceanic grandness was up to the task . if you think the film  s length indicates that a bulk of che  s life has been shown here  then think again . soderbergh focuses on che  s last phase  and a lot of the movie is tedious jungle nonsense  full of guevara  s alleged idealism .  psychopaths don  t have ideals .  i do wonder what kind of a mind this highly esteemed director has to have to actually choose to ignore some of che  s earlier life . did he actually consider it too uninteresting  a massacre of    people holds no interest for the viewer  huh  amazing . some much better directors than this over  praised charlatan would have easily fit not one but two complete biographies into a   hour movie .  br    br   soderbergh  in a sense  becomes an accomplice by never addressing the negative  dark side  which is more than     of guevara . by spreading this kind of historical inaccuracy  consciously ignoring the ugly truth  god forbid he should taint the holy image of che   soderbergh proves himself not a humanist  a fake image which most hollywood and pop music personalities struggle very hard all their careers to uphold  but the opposite that he cares only about ideas  never about the people on whom these ideas are tested  like on guinea pigs  . soderbergh and the like are elitists of the worst kind such people often have a latent contempt for the  proleteriat   what a stupid term  they  re supposedly siding with .  br    br   half of all students around the world wear che  s image on their red and orange shirts  but without ever knowing why . he has become an iconic figure for clueless  uninformed  very often young people  who think that by having this man  s face on their chest that somehow makes them appear  edgy   intellectual  hip or interesting . in reality  wearing a che shirt only underlines one  s overall shallowness and total disinterest in self  education .  wouldn  t you want to find out more about a person before you start advertising his  her face to the world   wearing che  s by  now clich image has become as common as having a bart simpson coffee cup . all those  che  wearers  probably know more about marge  s blue hair than they  ll ever read up on about fidel castro  s dead ally .  br    br   after everything that  d been done in the name of marx  one would think that these mongrel  ideals  would be finally laid to rest . it seems mankind will never learn . stalin  mao  kim il  pol pot  castro  milosevic  ceausescu  the iron curtain  a hundred million dead  more than a billion ruined physically and  or mentally through this system . . . so none of that matters  huh   br    br   the fact that del toro won a cannes award should only surprise those who are absolutely clueless as to how cannes and other european festivals work  and vote . hint sean penn headed a jury not long ago .  br    br   for my music  related rants  go to http   rateyourmusic . com  collection  fedor    ,0

this is a great  ridiculous horror movie that captures the essence of the mid to late   s  obsession with how evil metal music supposedly was . i can remember being freaked out by metal teens when i was a kid . it doesn  t help that i found a desecrated grave in my hometown  s graveyard when i was ten . turns out this weird metal kid had dug up some old bodies and used their bones in some weird sacrifice to satan . so maybe stuff like deterred me from metal for awhile  but i love it now  as a   year old .  br    br   i bought this dvd used for  bucks and i expected it to suck due to the lame cover  but to my surprise  it ruled . it is all about the extreme demonic power of metal . and you gotta love a scene where a guitar shoots lazers and vaporizes headbangers in the crowd . this movie is awesome  if you love   s metal and bad movies  this one  s for you .       ,1
the main problem of the first  vampires  movie is that none of the characters were sympathetic . carpenter learned from his mistake and this time used a likable vampire hunter and a charismatic vampire . the female vampire una certainly is the coolest vampire since blade  s deacon frost . unfortunately while there are some good concepts like a cool slow motion restaurant scene  why didn  t carpenter use more of this    this movie is nowhere near as good as it could have been . i expected to see strong vampires in action and at least one longer lasting nicely choreographed fight sequence  for example inside a city  and was left somewhat disappointed . while  los muertos  proceeds at a faster pace than its predecessor  it still drags a little in some parts  though nowhere near as bad as  vampires  did  . much like  vampires  however this movie  s climax near the end is not very intense .  br    br   most of the above may sound like  los muertos  is a bad movie but it definitely isn  t . it is generally enjoyable and ranks among the better entries to the genre . it is neither an unoriginal dracula remake  like almost every other vampire movie out there  nor is it an unintelligent action spectacle like blade ii . it simply could have used a bit more excitement .  br    br   i  d really like to see a third installment made by carpenter but it  s probably not going to happen .  br    br   spoiler warning the ending was way too predictable . una should have gotten away  that would have made the movie quite unusual .  ,1
according to imdb takashi miike  s master of horror  segment  imprint  was banned in the us . so i figured i  d translate the swedish review i just wrote for it . . .  br    br   it was hard to not have any sort of expectations from ichi the killer  director takashi miike  s episode in the masters of horror series . and the dvd  cover of imprint did in deed look very promising .  br    br   the story mostly takes place in a remote japanese bordello  some time during the   th century  and it tells the tale of a journalist searching for komomo  the woman he left behind and whom he promised to return for . tired and dejected he arrives at the bordello  hoping that this will be the end of his very long journey . it turns out that one of the prostitutes  a deformed and quiet girl  know about komomo  and the desperate man makes her tell him where she is and what has happened to her since he left . the story she tells him is as deplorable as it is hard to swallow . . .  br    br   the first thing that hit me about the episode was how unnatural it seemed that the japanese cast for the most part spoke fluent american  english . but i will leave it at that  it  s not that big a deal . what is a big deal however is how miserable the rest of it was . miike  s tale moves at such a slow pace that i couldn  t help looking at my watch several times during the   minutes . the extended torure  scene  that takes place somewhere in the middle of the movie  felt so unmotivated  and pornographically intrusive  that not even that scene became interesting . i felt like it was violent just for the sake of violence itself  with no sense of style or purpose . the only scenes that provoked any kind of emotion out of me were the images of bloody fetuses rolling along the bottom of the swiftly flowing water . . . and  in all honesty  the only emotions they provoked were feelings of disgust .  br    br   the journalist seeking the love he left behind is played by billy drago  for me most memorable as frank nitti  al capones whiteclad assassin in brian de palmas the untouchables       . i  ve always found dragos portrayal of nitti to be very icy  and i mean that in a good way   and that is probably why i was almost annoyed when i found him to be so terrible  not in a good way  in this one . his acting seems to flow between no feelings or empathy whatsoever to displays of some really bad overacting . when his character is supposed to react to the awful things komomo has been subjected to i was sitting in the sofa  twisting and turning in an attempt to escape the horrible actingjob put forth by drago . i  m grateful that most of the story is told by yuoki kudoh  memoirs of a geisha        who plays the deformed prostitute .  br    br   the finale is probably supposed to be chocking  maybe even revolting and horrid  but i just found it to be kind of . . . you know . . .  blah   and i looked at my watch again  for the umptieth time  just wishing the crappy episode would end  . maybe the finale caused me to smile just a bit  but that  s only because i couldn  t help thinking of an episode of red dwarf  and the upside  down chins of craig charles and danny john  jules  with eyes glued on them to make them look like aliens . . . lucky you  if you  ve seen that episode and now decide to see imprint  i will forever have ruined the visuals of the ending for you .  br    br   my first thought  when imprint finally ended  was that the only thing that made the pain of watching it worth it  was hearing the main title theme by edward shearmur  the same music i believe is used in every episode of this series   and that  if anything  is a big friggin warning  don  t you think   br    br   one might point to the costume design  by michiko kitamura  and say that there  at least  is something not lacking in style and refinement . . . but there are so many other films and tv  shows that is so much better at showing off the japanese  geisha  fashion  . this is nothing but inferior and i am disappointed . takashi miike  s masters of horror  episode is boring  uninspiring and pointless . in other words it  s really  really bad   ,0
i wanted to watch this movie because of eliza dushku  but she only has a smaller part in it  and her character isn  t very likable . however  the main character  played by melissa sagemiller  is extremely beautiful and a perfect delight to look at throughout the movie . this is really nothing but a showcase for her looks and talent . she does a very good job .  br    br   the story itself is  on the face of it  pretty nonsensical . after a car crash  some friends are possibly dead  but keeps on living their previous lives  while all sorts of mysterious things happen . some bad guys are after them  but we never really find out who they are  possibly they were the ones in the other car  but we certainly don  t hear anything about why they are after them  . the final scenes especially seem filmically ambitious  but i can  t get anything coherent out of it . the opening scene  where the bad guys  who wear some strange masks  cut a blond girl  s wrist and gather up some of her blood is never explained or followed up on . unless the bad guys are supposed to be a representation of the surgeons who  re trying to pull cassie  sagemiller  back from the dead . . . but no  that doesn  t seem to work . the bad guys are just bad guys they really just mess up a story that might otherwise have been interesting . in a supernatural story about death and love and sacrifice  who the hell needs bad guys   br    br    out of   .  ,0
in frank sinatra  s first three films  he was purely a speciality act ostensibly playing himself  he merely shows up to croon a song during a nightclub sequence in somebody else  s movie . in his fourth film  the very enjoyable  higher and higher   young blue eyes transitions into an acting career by playing an actual role . . . a task made easier because he  s playing himself in a fictional story that gives him a chance to croon a few numbers .  br    br   sinatra  s entrance is quite funny . michele morgan hears a knock at the door  and asks who  s there . from outside  a hoboken  toned voice answers  frank sinatra  . sure enough . . .  br    br   the opening credits of  higher and higher  may confuse some viewers  as the names of songwriters rodgers and hart are prominently displayed . in fact  they only contributed one song to this musical  disgustingly rich   which this cast manage to toss off as a sort of intro to an entirely different song   i  m a debutante  . interestingly  that rodgers  hart song   one of their weakest   is perhaps the least enjoyable song in this movie  s score several others are lively up  tempo numbers  notably  it  s a most important affair    when it comes to love  you  re on your own  and  i saw you first  .  br    br   sinatra  s good in this movie  but he would do better work  and sing better material  elsewhere . the real merits of  higher and higher  are the delightful turns by some performers who rarely made films . paul and grace hartman were an extremely popular husband  wife dance team who starred in several broadway revues genuinely graceful ballroom dancers  they put plenty of physical comedy into their dance material .  here  grace does a high kick that knocks a shoe out of paul  s hands .  grace hartman  who died of cancer at age    did almost no film work  so it  s a real pleasure that this film gives us a rare chance to see her close  up  to hear her beautiful singing voice and to notice how sexy she looks in her maid  s uniform . after grace hartman  s death  her husband had a long career as a character actor  just occasionally dancing solo .  or alongside ken berry in one memorable episode of  mayberry rfd  .   br    br   also quite attractive in a maid  s uniform here in  higher and higher  is the vivacious teenage singer marcy mcguire . why didn  t this talented girl make more movies  perhaps she was just a bit too similar in personality to betty hutton . i enjoy hutton  s performances but i like marcy mcguire even better . near the end of  higher and higher  there  s an amusing bit of physical business featuring mcguire and mary wickes as waitresses  taking it in turns to move from table to table in a nightclub . the alternating strides of short mcguire and tall gawky wickes are hilarious  regrettably  although leon errol plays a large role in  higher and higher   he is given almost no comedy business not once does he do his famous rubber  legged dance . jack haley  despite his prominent billing  is also wasted .  br    br   very well  represented here is dooley wilson  inevitably remembered as sam from  casablanca  . in that film  wilson did his own singing but faked his keyboard performance of  as time goes by  .  in real life  wilson couldn  t play piano .  here in  higher and higher   he sings pleasingly and gives some amusing reactions to the other players . less enjoyable is mel odious  i mean mel torme . victor borge gives a rare film performance here  handling his dialogue deftly but never doing any of the keyboard comedy which he later did successfully in his stage shows .  br    br   the plot  forget it .  higher and higher  is nobody  s idea of a  great  musical  but it  s an enjoyable delight  and i  ll rate it  out of   . director tim whelan  who worked in britain as well as in hollywood  deserves to be much better known .  ,1
this movie rates as one of my all time favourite top   movies . many people seeing it for the first time and knowing little about many of the themes in the movie probably won  t understand why i find it so enthralling so i will try to explain . . .  br    br   the movie is very rich in historical detail and cultural insights  and while it has a few minor anachronisms  they are completely forgivable . the story is a retelling of the famous duel between the monk benkei and the young prince yoshitsune on gojo bridge . during the fight according to legend yoshitsune bests benkei and the monk becomes the prince  s loyal retainer . this movie is a revision of that story however and involves war  dark prophecy  and political maneuvering .  br    br   one of the main themes in the movie is  mappo   which is the prophecy by the buddha that after     years his teachings would fail and the world would fall into chaos . it was believed in heian japan  after the eruption of mt fuji and the civil war between the taira  heike  and the minamoto  genji  that the world would fall into anarchy and everything would collapse . it is a time of demons .  br    br   next you have the way in which the movie resolves the issue of yoshitsune  s sword training by the tenku  raven goblins  of karuma . defeated clans often escaped into the mountains and disguised themselves as demons to scare the locals off . this is said to be where ninja clans began historically . yoshitsune  s depiction in gojo nicely accommodates all of this .  br    br   then there is benkei  and the various strains of buddhism depicted  including a lot of esoteric buddhism of the shingon sect . these are all depicted quite accurately  and just to add a little extra  the movie manages to convey the power of meditation and ki energy in a way that makes it integral to the story  i . e . it uses magic realism to add an extra dimension to the film but does it in such a way as to make it tactical and menacing .  br    br   all  in  all it is filled with fascinating tidbits and rings surprisingly true  to  life for the period . the scenery and the costuming are also completely unmissable and very authentic . the soundtrack is great  very brooding and ominous . i also thought that the actual acting performances were surprisingly good . benkei is a great brooding anti  hero  shanao  yoshitsune  is depicted as a young man testing his limits and growing increasingly drunk on his own power  and tetsukichi the scavenging sword  smith makes for and interesting depiction of the  common man  and his less than flattering opinion of the killers who fancy themselves his social betters .  br    br   as to the plot  to see why it is so good  i really suggest you dig up an old book on japanese history and see how this retelling turns an almost lighthearted robin hood vs little john story into a gory tale of intrigue  violence and infernal karma .  ,1
more than twenty years before peter jackson  s visionary adaptation of the lord of the rings  there was this     animated effort from director ralph bakshi . an ambitious and reasonably faithful version of the story  this has sadly been rather over  shadowed by the jackson trilogy . indeed  many reviewers here on the imdb  mainly those who saw the newer version first  seem to be fiercely unkind to this version . . . . but if one applies a little common sense  and takes into consideration the time when it was made and the technical possibilities that existed at that time  then they will realise that this is a pretty good film . indeed  it was shortly after seeing this animated movie back in the early    s that i sought out tolkien  s book and immediately became a lifelong fan of these richly detailed middle earth adventures . so  in some respects  i owe this film a degree of acknowledgement as the film which shaped my literary tastes forever .  br    br   sauron  the dark lord of middle earth  forges an all  powerful ring that gives him incredible power . following a great battle during which sauron is defeated  the ring falls into possession of a king named isildur . but instead of destroying it he foolishly chooses to keep it . for centuries the ring passes from hand to hand  eventually coming into the possession of a hobbit named frodo baggins who lives in a peace  loving community known as the shire . frodo learns from a wizard named gandalf that his ring is in fact the one ring  the very same that was forged by sauron all those centuries ago  and that its master is once again searching for it in order to restore his dark power over the entire land . frodo embarks on a perilous journey to protect the ring with three other hobbit companions  but every step of the way they are hunted by sauron  s ring  wraiths  the black riders . there follow many adventures  during which a company of nine adventurers is formed to guide the ring to the only place where it can be  unmade   mount doom  in the land of mordor . the film concludes with frodo and his best friend sam on the borders of mordor  closing ever nearer to their horrifying destination . meanwhile gandalf and the other members of the company fight off a huge army of orcs at the legendary fortress of helm  s deep .  br    br   this version covers just over half of the original book . a second instalment was planned to bring the story to an end  but was sadly never completed . while the ending feels abrupt  it does at least end at a sensible point in the story . one has to feel a little frustration and regret that no sequel exists in which we might follow these animated heroes to their eventual goal . the animation is passable  with a nice variety of locales and characters presented in interesting detail . the music by leonard rosenman is suitably stirring and fits in appropriately with the epic narrative . the voice  overs are decent  too  especially john hurt as aragorn and peter woodthorpe as gollum . on the other hand  michael scholes  who provides the voice for sam  is rather campy and goofy  which is not well suited to the character . the lord of the rings is a commendable attempt to visualise the staggering book on which it is based .  ,1
i suppose it  s nice and trendy to see wonderful things in the absolute emptiness of a film like this . with the sometimes pointless excesses of many hollywood films  we can relax and enjoy a scene devoid of explosions  foul language  and corny one  liners . minimalism has its place  and can be very effective when employed properly . however  this film is not one of those cases .  br    br   take the long scenes with no dialogue and dreary  sparse scenery . i  m sure that they must hold some great meaning and insight  because the implied message in shrouded in bafflement . the acting is poor . . . bland and pedestrian . . . and features one of the worst crying scenes in history  at the end of the film  if you can sit through it to the end  . the scenery is drab  and the ridiculously long ending sequence of the girl walking through the barren park is as pleasurable as having a tooth pulled . i would call this anticlimatic  but as the film didn  t build to any sort of climax whatsoever . . . not even in the  erotic  scenes . . . it would be untrue . i  m sure that there was a script employed during the filming  but with the amount of dialogue  i think it might have been written on a cocktail napkin . basically  this film offers nothing to interest or amaze . . . no great story  no stunning insights  no visual drama  no excitement . apart from two or three amusing moments  this film is a waste of two hours . a tragically boring and dreary film .  ,0
this episode introduced the holodeck to the tng world . the jarada have to be contacted and a precise greeting must be delivered or it would greatly insult them . a tired picard decides to take a trip into the holodeck and a wonderful adventure begins . the settings are superb and almost movie like . alas  the jarada probe sent shortly thereafter damages the holodeck and all it  s safety devices stop working . picard and now guests must outwit the mobsters of gangland   s america and return to the jarada rendezvous . picard greets the jarada correctly and a new day dawns between humanity and the jarada . this gem of a first season episode set the holodeck for many interesting and unusual adventures to be had there  ,1
what happens when the average joe finds out he has supernatural powers  the premise may sound familiar . the watchmen  unbreakable  however  the russian sci  fi action flick  the sword bearer  is far from the standard stock .  br    br   the story revolves around a man named sasha who as a boy was shunned from society  his peers and family due to a supernatural power that he possess . when he wishes or his anger allows  a sword extends from his arm piercing his own skin . very wolverinish  maybe . . . but that  s not the interesting part of this film . shunned all his life and driven by anger  and a temper he does have  our  hero  returns to his home town to turn his life around or find a reason to . the only thing he encounters here is trouble when an encounter with an old flame  s new boyfriend leaves him bloodied on the ground . this is where the vengeance and anger comes into play . this is a man you do not want to cross and from this point the mafia and the police are on his tail . he meets a girl and falls in love instantly as does she and this is really what the movie is about .  br    br   the film is highly impressionistic with bold colors and noir overtones spliced with short yet extreme action sequences . this is art house at it  s core  beautifully filmed with such attention to details in every scene over gruesome sci  fi action . it  s this odd mash that interests me so much in this film . the directors approach for this genre is refreshing focusing on the emotional journey of sasha and not a straight action film . don  t worry though  the action is there and plenty of it . however  much of these sequences show only implied violence with pictures of the horrific aftermath . this is not to say that action is not shown . these scenes are here and are fantastic  especially the ending where we see sasha  s full powers unleashed in desperation  . the director chooses to imply the violence of many scenes to keep the focus on the character  s emotional struggle at hand . this is a tragic love story and a refreshing entry into the genre .  ,1
i saw this in theaters and absolutely adored it . geoffery rush gave the best performance as a super villain that i have ever seen since gene hackman as lex luther . kel mitchel and paul rubens were a match maid in heaven . this film also introduced me to william h . macy  who is now one of my favorite actors . hank was great as the blue raja  and i especially loved that the character wasn  t really british . the scene with him and telling his mom that he was a superhero almost brought tears to my eyes . i loved the fact that the bowler talked to the ball . some of the funniest stuff involved stiller and his character mr . furious  s false rage  and the fact that his threats and one  liners were all gibberish  and that they never made any sense . i could barely stop myself from applauding when he said  fraculater  freinken  puss   was said . but one of the things i most enjoyed was that captain amazing actually dies in the movie . i highly recommend this film for any occasion  and i give it my own personal two  thumbs  up .  ,1
i finally saw this film tonight after renting it at blockbuster  vhs  . i have to agree that it is wildly original . yes  maybe the characters were not fully realized but it isn  t one of those movies . rather  we are treated to the director  s eye  his vision of what the story is about . and it does not stop . and to be honest  i didn  t want it to . i do believe that sabu had to have influenced the director  s of  lock  stock  two smoking barrels  and  run  lola  run  . but i absolutely loved the way the three leads see the beautiful woman on the street to distract them momentarily . i really need to see this director  s other work because this film really intrigued me . if you want insight  culture  sturm und drang  go somewhere else . if you want a laugh  camera movement and criminal hilarity  look here .  ,1
well it looked good on paper  nick cage and jerry buckheimer collaborate again  this time on a mix of heist movie  da vinci code  american history    and indiana jones . but oh dear  this is to indiana jones what speed  is to speed . a reasonable cast  including john voight and harvey keitel  battles against a puerile script and loses badly . the film is little more than an extended advert for the freemasons . however these freemasons are not your usual shopkeepers who use funny handshakes and play golf  these freemasons are the natural descendants of the knights templar  and nobody mention  from hell  or jack the ripper .  i don  t think i  ve revealed any plot spoilers because there are none . there is virtually no suspense  no surprises and no climax  it just stops . national treasure aims for dan brown but hits the same intellectual level as an episode of scooby doo sans the humour .  ,0
this tale based on two edgar allen poe pieces   the fall of the house of usher    dance of death   poem   is actually quite creepy from beginning to end . it is similar to some of the old black  and  white movies about people that meet in an old decrepit house  for example   the cat and the canary    the old dark house    night of terror  and so on  . boris karloff plays a demented inventor of life  size dolls that terrorize the guests . he dies early in the film  or does he   and the residents of the house are subjected to a number of terrifying experiences . i won  t go into too much detail here  but it is definitely a must  see for fans of old dark house mysteries .  br    br   watch it with plenty of popcorn and soda in a darkened room .  br    br   dan basinger      ,1
in this forgettable trifle  the    ish norma shearer plays a fluttery  girlish socialite in monte carlo  caught in a tussle between george sanders and robert taylor . it would be tempting to blame this movie  s failure on the dull  talky script  or director george cukor  who never seems interested in livening up the film  s generally comatose state . mostly  though  it  s the fault of shearer herself  who desperately wanted to keep playing  young  parts as long as she could get away with it . inadvertently  this makes  her cardboard lover  a bizarre monument to an aging woman  s vanity .  ,0
takashi shimizu had a great opportunity with a remake of his original film ju  on the grudge . while i haven  t seen that film  i would have to wager that there  s more imagination and originality  or some rip  off originality  in other words skill with known tropes of the japanese ghost movie  than in his own directed remake . maybe the script was written to somehow have some kind of warped appeal  or i would guess accessibility  for an american audience . what starts off with some potential  the hint of something very screwed up going on with bill pullman  s sudden movement  just goes into a total jumble . and as a horror movie  gimme a break .  br    br   tension could have been built on the situation  a nurse going to take care of a disturbed woman in a house that is haunted  but he undercuts everything he wants to get his audience to feel . scares  how  s about some music timed just so you know when exactly to expect something . a black cat  yeah  why not just make the ghost  boy thing sound like a cat for creepiness which  in effect  is only creepy if you want cats . plot  why not just shuffle between past and present without any semblance of an actual flow of how a story could be told  meaning  while the flashbacks are inserted and are meant to be organic with the story overall  they aren  t   or for that matter have us care about anyone in the cast .  br    br   by the time the characters  or those that are there for exposition  get around to telling us what is going on or whatever  there  s little point to care . the film  making is shoddy  i . e . the    degree rule is broken many times over and not in a forgivable or intriguing way   and the performances are wooden even when looking frightened or shocked  gellar especially is disappointing  but pullman  who shows up later after his first scene  is sorely miscast  . even when shimizu tries for some average old  boo  scares  like when the woman is in the office building and chased by the grudge ghost  it  s still silly . just watch when she  s going on that elevator and the ghost is in the background of shots . either you  ll go with it  and if so more power to you  or you  ll laugh hysterically at the results . count me in the latter .  br    br   i  m not totally sure where this project went wrong  was it shimizu having to retool it for the studios  or him not giving enough leeway with his revamp of his vision  or maybe raimi had some say in it and made things more confusing and  or dull than they would be with someone else . the grudge gives us a lot of information that doesn  t make sense or at the least give us some horror  fodder to chew on . it  s cineplex trash of a sad order .  ,0
  pushing daisies  for sure is one of the best tv shows of its genre in the last  years  agree you with that or not . bryan fuller  the creator  has an amazing creative mind . he  s the mind behind other great tv shows as  dead like me          wonderfalls         and the other one not as great as these ones  but also interesting   heroes        . it  s a mix of the marvelous worlds brian fuller created in previous tv shows  mixing once again an amazing fantasy world with real kinds of people disguised into colorful images and exaggerated feelings  something that a fairytale always is . so  being a kind of fairytale  you cannot expect more than a unrealistic world and unexpected situations  or also situations a lot expected but not in a way that it would usually be told .  br    br   a gift always comes with a curse  and what is sweet can also be bitter . that  s so  ned  lee pace   the piemaker  is a simple guy with an interesting gift other than being an amazing chef he can give life to the dead with just a touch . this could be a power that everybody would die  or live  for if wasn  t for another simple and very sad thing he can also gives the forever dead if he touches it again . the curse of this amazing gift doesn  t stops there . . . everything has a compensation and if he brings anything to life for more than one minute  another specie of that one would die instantly . he  s a guy full of unfortunate events in life in a way that he grown up introspectively  always afraid to touch everything and lose once more things he one day used to love . till the day he could finally be close to his biggest childhood love  chuck  anna friel   if wasn  t for another sad fact she was dead . he gave her life again and she loves him so much as he does  but this love is untouchable . the truly kiss of death . and that  s how this beautiful modern fairytale starts .  br    br   when i heard about  pushing daisies  for the first time it was promoted as something very familiar  or maybe some kind of tribute  to everything that tim burton has created since  pee  wee  s big adventure        to  big fish        and  charlie and the cholate factory        . the results could not be better . the world around the pie hole was magnificent . the stories around ned and detective cod  chi mcbride  to solve unsolved crimes can be a lot common in tv  but this is just a way to guide people thru amazing stories surrounding characters as chuck and olive  kristin chenoweth  in a wonderful world full of beautiful and dreamy images that you can almost sense the taste of the colors . not only that  you are merged into a bunch of amazing and charismatic gentle characters  even those ones with the most deep dark humors .  br    br   forgetting the trivial concept of murders and unsolved crimes  the show brights and is triumphant in a lot of other things . the actors here are top of note . lee pace is tender  soft and contained as the character asks for . anna friel is the muse of the show as her character is supposed to be . but the most superb times are always with the supporting actors as chi mcbride  detective emmerson cod   swoozie kurtz  as lilly charles   ellen greene  as vivian charles  and kristin chenoweth  as olive snook  . swoozie kurtz shines performing a so dried character drowned in a impossible dark humor that could frighten a clown  for sure she has the best dialogs and her expressions and body languages are mesmerizing . but if the best dialogs are given by swoozie and her character  the best funny moments are given by kristin chenoweth . seems that she  s improvising all the time  she  s so naturally fun that every single scene is a show aside . kristin shines so bright in the show that winning the     emmy for her supporting role in the show was totally fair and deserved . also there  s the chemistry between actors and their characters  that are also amazing .  br    br   there are no words to express what this tv show really is and what it was meant to be . for those ones who think this show is a waste of time or claimed to find no sense in it  for sure needs to open their minds and comeback to a time that they probably never had childhood .  br    br   truth be told . . . tv has never been so daring in a tv show as with this amazing one .  pushing daisies  was a huge step forward in terms of great artistic entertainment and its sudden death was a lot disrespectful . it  s true that tv doesn  t respect great tv shows as those ones bryan fuller created  except  heroes  that  s still on air and is far from being so amazing as the other ones .  ,1
late one night on a desolate road  in an empty saloon martin sheen spins a yarn for robert carradine of hopalong cassidy and friends tracking a group of murderous cattle rustlers  who  ve killed a few men and kidnapped cassidy  s girl .  br    br   writer  director christopher coppola may have incurred the wrath of william boyd purists by daring to make a modern low budget film featuring their beloved hoppy  but i  m glad he did it  no character should be so tied to an an actor that no one else ever be allowed to play him or her again   br    br   i thought it was good fun and an interesting updating of the classic programmers of the thirties and forties . though guilty of some bad acting  this is earnest enough and unpretentious  making it hard for me to dislike .  br    br   the whole production is a bit odd though  but i really enjoyed the scenes between sheen and carridine . the fact that we  re watching a story within a story makes the oddness and exaggerations more palatable .  ,1
my friend and i picked  paperhouse  out of a random pile of movies on our weekly excursion to the horror section   neither of us had heard of it  but the blurb on the box was really promising . and the movie didn  t disappoint  though i still probably wouldn  t call it a horror movie exclusively .  br    br      year old anna madden draws a house  and visits it in her dreams . she is definitely asleep when she  s seeing the house  but it  s so real in a sense that it  s almost like a completely separate reality . which  in view of later events  doesn  t seem like a far cry from the truth . anyhow  she finds she can add to the house  its contents and its surroundings by simply adding to the picture .  br    br   while this is going on  anna is getting increasingly more ill with a fever  and besides that is getting totally obsessed with the house and her drawing . on top of that  she and her mother are also dealing with her absent father he has a job that takes him away for long stretches  though one gets the impression there  s actually more to the story than that .  br    br   ok  so the drawing stuff sounds nice enough   but frankly there  s something really menacing about it . the dreamworld is eerily surreal   the house  for instance  is just a grey block in the middle of a desolate field . the folks who made the movie did a great job of making us very uncomfortable with this alternate world  ongoing dream . . .  br    br   one of the things anna adds to the house is a boy  mark  who seems to be the same patient her doctor keeps talking about  i  m not giving that away  you know from the moment he appears that it  s the same kid  . in reality  mark can  t walk due to an illness in anna  s drawing  world  he can  t walk because she didn  t draw him any legs . she blames herself for his real  life illness  and tries to rectify the situation  but . . . everything starts getting really weird . she even brings her absent father into the drawing  with disastrous results . the bits with the father are really terrifying .  br    br   i don  t want to give anything away  so i  ll stop there . . . there seems to be a lot going on in this film . i  m sure you  ll have a ball analyzing this thing do death with your pals after you watch it   is it a simple a story as it seems  or are there actually layers of meaning  i don  t know  but either way it  s quite fascinating . there was a  nightmare on elm street   ish quality about it  in that at a certain point reality and dreams intersect . i love things like that .  br    br   my only complaint is that it feels like it could have ended many times  but didn  t . i  m satisfied with the ending it had  some of you sensitive types might want to have kleenex handy    though it really could have a variety of conclusions . anyway  it doesn  t exactly feel drawn out once it  s actually over  but while you  re watching and it keeps fading back in  it  s a little nerve wracking .  br    br   still   paperhouse  is a really good film . it  s well done  and acting   especially charlotte burke as anna   is top notch . burke  who has never before or since appeared in a film  is a real gem . i don  t know why she never went onto do anything else  but either way she  s really convincing and enjoyable to watch .  br    br    paperhouse  isn  t exactly a horror movie  it  s sort of a fantasy  suspense  something else type of movie  with some definite horroresque moments   but you can still watch it with your family and not be worried that your little brother or grandmother will get grossed out by blood splashing or something .  br    br   give it a chance  you won  t regret it  and maybe you should read the book  too . . .  ,1
i must admit i burst out laughing when i saw one reviewer compare this to lotr . well yes  if you exclude the dwarfs  the cast of thousands  the great special effects  the big battles  the strong characterization  the decent plot  the good acting  the classy direction and everything else . which leaves you with the walking . and boy  does this film do walking  if mr piano had his way  this would probably be an uninterrupted three hours of hardcore walking through the wisconsin countryside  but every   minutes or so these pesky martians pop up for a few seconds to interrupt him before he goes for another bit of a ramble . you  ve never seen so much walking in a movie . if this really had a    m budget  most of it must have gone on mr piano  s shoes  because he had to get through plenty of pairs with all the walking he does . which explains why there  s no money left for decent effects  a decent video camera or proper actors . honestly  it  s like watching some bizarre fetish video for people with a thing about going for long walks in period costumes . even on fast  forward  this is a looonnnggg walk .  br    br   as for the sci  fi stuff  i think it was a mistake to put martians in the film they only get in the way of the walking  which is clearly much more interesting to the director than the story .  br    br   i wonder how much mr piano charges to walk dogs   ,0
i haven  t seen this movie in about  years  but it still haunts me .  br    br   when asked about my favorite films  this is the one that i seem to always mention first . there are certain films  works of art like this film   dark city   and  breaking the waves   that seem to touch a place within you  a place so protected and hidden and yet so sensitive  that they make a lifelong impression on the viewer  not unlike a life  changing event  such as the ending of a serious relationship or the death of a friend . . . this film  shook  me when i first saw it . it left me with an emotional hangover that lasted for several days .  ,1

and maybe  as fred sandford used to say   one across the lips  . that to those who released this film on an unsuspecting public . and perhaps to the person in  rue morgue  who called this a  fender hellbender  and said it was good .  br    br   five young girls  apparently taking a short  cut home from a high school football game  become lost and stop to ask directions at some small store in the middle of nowhere . while there the driver accidentally hits a parked suv  knocks out a headlight  but the girls all decide to just leave  not go find the driver . but the driver does come to find them  and it  s not just that the headlight on her vehicle got dinged  it  s for another reason that the girls do not yet understand . when the driver does first catch them she  yes  it  s a she  brandishes a shot gun  makes them strip down  and keeps screaming at them   how much did you see   . of course the girls are scared to death  don  t know what she  s talking about .  br    br   as the night rolls on the girls end up in a cat and mouse game with the driver of the suv  who manages to inflict all manner of injuries on the girls  who are remarkably resilient to shot gun blasts and screwdrivers where they didn  t want them . eventually they come to find that something happened back at that store after they left that is the reason for this woman  s psychotic rage . and eventually they have a chance at revenge and take it about as far as they can go .  br    br   there are elements of this film that are rather disturbing and scary  but unfortunately  those moments are undermined by bad acting  bad dialog  and huge lapses of credibility . one girl is hit by a shot gun blast and appears to be mortally wounded  and she  s feeling cold  her life is passing before her eyes  but she got better  and how far can a mini  van run on an almost empty gas tank at speeds of   miles per hour  i need one of those things  it apparently gets great mileage .  br    br   there should have been an ending when the girls got their revenge  but the film goes on for a bit after that  which is an anti  climax  but they at least learn some of what set the woman off  and the driver is still worried about  messing up her mom  s van   which is obviously the least of anyone  s worries .  br    br   so this isn  t the worst film i  ve seen  but it  s too amateur to be good and yet a bit too scary and gruesome at times to be completely terrible . but it does take the cake for plenty of shrill hysterics and you  ll want to put two across your ears if you watch this . which  by the way  i don  t necessarily recommend .  out of   .  ,0
i  ve gotta say  i usually like horror movies that i  ve never seen . . . however  this one was just to pathetic for my gory taste . i  m used to the gory  gut wrenching types . . . but this particular movie was lame . the acting was horrible  yet the corny  no pun intended  one  liners were cute  . and the sequel to it  scarecrow slayer was even worse  yes  probably  when it first came out  there was a huge rave about it and people liked it . but when movies like the ring and the exorcist of emily rose come out  movies like these make movies like scarecrow seem childish . if you want a movie to just pass the time  pick this one  the special effects are cheesy as heck . but seeing that it was a low budget movie  i can kind of see where that would come in . this will kind of remind you of the movie  children of the corn .  independent movies rock . . . . most of the time . so if you want to see a scarecrow killing people with corncobs  or in the sequel   scarecrows going at it  then these movies would be for you .  ,0
    spoilers      br    br   before i begin this  let me say that i have had both the advantages of seeing this movie on the big screen and of having seen the  authorized version  of this movie  remade by stephen king  himself  in     .  br    br   both advantages made me appreciate this version of  the shining   all the more .  br    br   also  let me say that i  ve read mr . king  s book   the shining  on many occasions over the years  and while i love the book and am a huge fan of his work  stanley kubrick  s retelling of this story is far more compelling . . . and scary .  br    br   kubrick really knows how to convey the terror of the psyche straight to film . in the direction of the movie and the writing of the screenplay  itself  he acquired the title  magus  beyond question . kubrick  s genius is like magic . the movie world lost a great director when he died in     . among his other outstanding credits are eyes wide shut       full metal jacket       barry lyndon       a clockwork orange            a space odyssey       spartacus      and many more .  br    br   the torrences  jack  wendy his wife and danny  their son  are living in the overlook hotel for the winter jack has been hired as the caretaker . it is his job to oversee the upkeep of the hotel during the several months of hard snow  until spring when the overlook reopens its doors . it seems there are many wealthy and jaded tourists who will flock to the colorado mountains for a snow  filled summer getaway .  br    br   the hotel was an impressive piece of architecture and staging . it lent to the atmosphere  by having a dark  yet at the same time  welcoming  atmosphere  itself . the furnishings and furniture was all period  late    s  early    s   and the filmography of the landscape approaching the hotel in the opening scene is brilliant . it not only lets you enjoy the approach to the overlook  it also fixes in your mind how deserted and isolated the hotel is from the rest of the world .  br    br   the introduction of wendy and danny  s characters was a stroke of genius . you get the whole story of their past  danny  s  imaginary friend   tony  and the story of jack  s alcoholism all rolled into this nice  neat introductory scene . there was no need in stretching the past history out over two hours of the movie obviously  kubrick saw that from the beginning .  br    br   closing day . again  the scenic drive up the mountains to the hotel  this time  with family in tow   the interaction between jack and danny was hilarious while also portraying a very disturbing exchange .  br    br   the initial tour through the overlook is quite breathtaking  even as the  staff  is moving things out  you get a chance to see the majestic fire places  the high cathedral ceilings and expensive furnishings  dormants and crown moldings in the architecture .  they did a good job  pink and gold are my favorite colors .   wendy torrence  even the  staff wing  is well designed and beautifully built .  br    br   the maze was a magnificent touch  reminiscent of the labyrinth in which the minotaur of crete was guardian . when jack nicholson stands at the scaled model of the maze and stares into the center  seeing wendy and danny entering  it  s a magickal moment one that tells you right away  there are heavy energies in that house there  s something seriously wrong  already starting .  i wouldn  t want to go in there unless i had at least an hour to find my way out .   the hotel manager   br    br   scatman cruthers  as dick halloran  was genuine and open in his performance . his smiles were natural and his performance was wonderful . you could actually believe you were there in the hotel  taking the tour of the kitchen with wendy and  doc .  his explanation of  the shining  to danny was very well delivered  as was his conversation with the child about tony and the hotel . it was believable and sincere .  br    br   the cut out and pan scan of the hotel itself  with the mountains looming behind  the cold air swirling about  mist coming up from the warm roof of the snowbound hotel  adds so much to the atmosphere of the movie . it also marks the  half  way  to  hell  point  so to speak the turning point in the movie .  br    br   shelley duvall  s portrayal of wendy torrence was masterful .  so what if she also played olive oyl   it just shows her marvelous diversity   honestly  before i saw the movie on the big screen in      i said   what  olive oyl  lol  popeye was also released in     .  but i took that back as soon as the movie started . she  s brilliant . in this fiend  s opinion  this is her best performance  to date   although i did love her in steve martin  s  roxanne       .   br    br   once kubrick has established the pearly bits of information of which you  the viewer  need to be in possession the torrence  s past danny  s broken arm tony the history of the hotel itself the fact that danny is not  mental   but rather clairvoyant instead  and the general layout of the hotel all of which you get in the opening  sequences the movie never stops scaring you .  br    br   the two butchered daughters of the previous caretaker  delbert grady  the girls having appeared several times to danny  first by way of tony in the apartment before the family ever left for the hotel  were icons with which danny could identify  and of which he was afraid  at the same time . they were haunting  and haunted   themselves and showed danny how and where they were killed  in a rather graphic and material way .  br    br   kubrick  s tony was written as an attendant spirit  like a spirit guide which he acquired as a result of his arm nearly being wrenched off his body by his own father . he was . . .  the little boy who lives in my mouth .  he would manifest in the end of danny  s finger and physically spoke through danny in order to speak to danny . not like in the book  i realize  where tony was intended by stephen king to be the projection of danny as an older boy  trying to save his father . kubrick left out that little twist and it somehow made it more frightening when tony  took . . . danny . . . over .  the idea of danny  s older self projecting back to his younger self isn  t . . . scary .  br    br   the  woman in the shower  scene  done by lia beldan  about whom i can find no other credits for having done anything before  or since  as the younger woman and billie gibson  who also appears to suffer from a lack of credits for works before or since   was seductively obnoxious and thoroughly disgusting . it was dramatic  and frightening . abhorrent and scary . when nicholson looks into the mirror and sees her decomposing flesh beneath his hands the look of sheer terror on his face was so complete and real .  br    br   jack quickly embarks on his trek from the  jonesing  alcoholic to a certifiable insane person . the degradation of his character  s mental state is carefully and thoroughly documented by kubrick . jack  s instant friendship with lloyd the bartender  as only alcoholics  would  be mental patients and drug addicts do  portrays his pressing need of the atmosphere to which lloyd avails him namely  alcohol . . .  hair of the dog that bit me .   jack torrence  in jack  s case  it  s bourbon on the rocks  at no charge to jack .  orders from the house .   lloyd the bartender  nice play on words .  br    br   when wendy find  s jack  s  screenplay  is nothing more than page after page of the same line typed over and over  albeit in  or  different creative styles . . . when he asks from the shadows   how do you like it   and wendy whirls and screams with the baseball bat in her hand . . . is so poignant . it  s the point where she realizes how messed up the whole situation is . . . how messed up jack is . it  s very scary  dramatic and delivers a strong presence . that coupled with danny  s visions of the hotel lobby filling with blood  imposed over the scene between jack and wendy  and with the confrontational ending to this scene  make this possibly the strongest scene of the movie .  br    br   the  redrum  scene . wow . what do i say  what mother would not be totally freaked by awakening to find their young  troubled son standing over them with a huge knife  talking in that freaky little voice  exclaiming  redrum  over and over  even if it had no meaning  it would still be as scary as the  th level of hell . it was something everyone could  and has  remember  ed  . speaking of memorable scenes . . .  br    br   nicholson  s final assault on his family with an axe was perhaps one of the scariest scenes of movie history . his ad  libbed line   heeeeere  s johnny   was a stroke of brilliance and is one of the most memorable scenes in the history of horror . it also goes down in horror movie history .  br    br   the ending . .  kubrick  s ending was perfection . i felt it ended beautifully . no smarm  no platitudinous whining  no tearfully idiotic ending for this movie . just epitomized perfection . that  s all i  ll say on the subject of the ending .  br    br   who cares what was taken out   look what kubrick put in . rent it  watch it  buy it . it  s a classic in the horror genre  and for good reason . it rawks    br    br   me being me . . . take this movie  and sitck it in your stephen king collection  and take the      authorized  version done by king and stick it down in the kiddie section . that  s where it belongs . .  this movie rates a  .   from the fiend  .  ,1
the stock market crash of     and the depression following almost ruined the american musical theater  in fact it was the final death blow to vaudeville . those behind the curtains were hit as bad as those in front .  br    br   in an effort to stimulate the show business economy and his own personal economy  out of work theater director james cagney comes up with a brilliant idea . stage live relevant prologues to the movies that are being shown at the various movie theaters that are springing up overnight from the old theaters . some other competitors get wind of it and the competition is on .  br    br   footlight parade is my favorite busby berkeley film . it gives james cagney a chance to display some of his versatility as a dancer as well as a tough guy . in his retirement cagney said that while he screened his few and far between musicals a lot  he could barely be bothered with some of his straight dramatic films . he wished he  d done a few more musicals in his career and i wish he had .  br    br   of course the staging of these busby berkeley extravaganzas on the stage of a movie palace defies all logic and reason . but it  s so creative and fun to watch .  br    br   dick powell gets to sing three songs in footlight parade  ah the moon is here  honeymoon hotel  and by a waterfall  the last two with ruby keeler further cementing that screen team . ruby sings and dances with powell in the last two and she partners with james cagney in my favorite number from footlight parade  shanghai lil .  br    br   joan blondell is cagney  s no nonsense girl friday at the theater . like in blonde crazy  she  s the one with the real brains in that duo and it  s her quick thinking that bails him out of some domestic problems he has on top of his theatrical ones . one of blondell  s best screen roles .  br    br   look for dorothy lamour and ann sothern in the chorus as per the imdb pages for both of them . john garfield is seen briefly in the shanghai lil number . and in a scene at the beginning of the film  producer guy kibbee takes cagney to a movie theater where they are showing a b western starring john wayne . the duke  s voice is unmistakable . but what  s even more unusual is that the brief clip shows him in a scene with frank mchugh who plays another cagney assistant in footlight parade . i think the brothers warner were playing a little joke there . i  ve got to believe that clip was deliberate .  br    br   footlight parade is busby berkeley at his surreal best .  ,1
i have to say although i despise these kind of shows  shock horror  i  m a girl  i feel i have to express my opinion . i had seen dirty sanchez before i saw jackass and think it way surpasses jackass in terms of programme making . story lines and interviews are inter weaved to create a more interesting show . i saw a few minutes of jackass movie the other night and couldn  t believe how poorly put together it was  everything just put in a line joke after joke with no relation between anything . it must have been the quickest easiest show to edit ever  shockingly amateur . while drinking puke isn  t really my thing  as far as a substantial entertainment show goes  dirty sanchez is way out of jackass  s league .  ,1
this was the first of panahi  s films that i have seen  i saw it at melbourne film festival . i was totally absorbed by the different characters that he creates and how differently they react and behave compared to aussie kids and yet on other levels how similarly . i think perhaps if more people could see movies like this  they could see people as individuals and avoid racism that can often be fueled by the fear of the unknown . there are the obvious large political differences between oz culture and iranian culture  but i found the more subtle differences between the characters  that this film fleshes out so successfully on screen  extremely fascinating . there are idiosyncrasies in the characters that seem to me  so unique . i found it made the characters compelling viewing .  ,1
the title should have been  the walker  . that was only he did walk .  br    br   there was nothing on the movie that was good . the description of the movie doesn  t really comply with the plot .  br    br   the only thing that i can get from the movie is that he was a good son  but a low life terrible person .  br    br   i  m sorry that i expend my money and time  on this movie . i saw people leaving the theater in the middle of the movie . i stayed hoping that it will better . . . . what a mistake . i got worse .  br    br   if there is a suggestion that i can make to he producer is to re  direct his life to another field  because making movies is definitely no his cup of tea  ,0
i found this to be a charming adaptation  very lively and full of fun . with the exception of a couple of major errors  the cast is wonderful . i have to echo some of the earlier comments   chynna phillips is horribly miscast as a teenager . at    she  s just too old  and  yes  it does show   and lacks the singing  chops  for broadway  style music . vanessa williams is a decent  enough singer and  for a non  dancer  she  s adequate . however  she is not latina  and her character definitely is . she  s also very strident throughout  which gets tiresome .  br    br   the girls of sweet apple  s conrad birdie fan club really sparkle   with special kudos to brigitta dau and chiara zanni . i also enjoyed tyne daly  s performance  though i  m not generally a fan of her work . finally  the dancing shriners are a riot  especially the dorky three in the bar .  br    br   the movie is suitable for the whole family  and i highly recommend it .  ,1
if you are wondering where many of the conspiracy theories and paranoid ideas about the the un  israel  and international affairs come from  look no further .  br    br   this isn  t a supernatural hollywood film loosely based on some biblical passage . instead  this movie was made by a company  cloud ten pictures  with a political and religious agenda . as a movie  the end result at times more looks like clips out of a televangelism program  complete with family prayers and light breaking through church windows while harps are playing  .  br    br   for mainstream viewers  it may be hard to believe  but many people believe in this stuff literally  as presented in the movie . and that  perhaps  makes the movie important . you probably won  t find a more concise exposition of the bizarre views of a significant number of your fellow citizens . so  if you view it  view it as a social  cultural document . if you are at all media savvy  you don  t need to be warned about the unsubtle attempts at propaganda and manipulation in the movie .  ,0
i know sometimes its really really corny . . . but the acting is amazing and melissa joan hart is as cute as a button . i love this show a lot  and i  m almost embarrassed that i do b  c the show has a rep . for being really corny  but it makes me feel good . my only problem is that sometimes it can be pretty low budget  sometimes actors change and you just have to deal with it . . . like sabrina  s father is  different guys throughout the course of the movie . . . i mean  couldn  t they just say he was an uncle or something  still  i can  t help but loving this show . harvey and sabrina make a really cute couple and salem is absolutely hilarious . i definitely recommend it if your looking for some light and funny entertainment . . . my favorite episode is  pancake madness  . . . a hilarious episode . the best season is probably  . . . i  m not really a fan of some of the seventh season twists . . . once you get to college  morgan joins the group and her dialog is painful and very poorly acted . . . plus she is ugly  so the jokes about how she is only surviving off her good looks were lost on me . . . but i think it was set up to have a really good eighth season and i was really sad to see one of my favorite shows canceled   ,1
the first half was ok  but the last half really  really disappointed . it  s funny the producers even admitted they didn  t have a clue for the ending  and it really showed . whats really sad is i have to write ten lines of comment minimum to be able to post this . i really didn  t want to include spoilers to qualify my remarks since the show isn  t really worth that effort . when battlestar galatica first came out i was really excited with the prospect of a better remake  it didn  t happen that first season border on being space porn . they eventually cleaned it up a bit and actually had some pretty fair drama  so i started watching again . but to end the series with kara being a cyclon god angel  same with baltar and six was pretty dumb .  ,0
cannot believe a movie that can be made that good in     and is virtually unknown in the west . not to repeat other reviews here . the score is very good and moving . literally it means  dawn please never comes   when it comes  the beautiful ghost and the lover will be apart forever . after   years  joel and leslie still look great . i enjoyed joel in god of gamblers and many movies by leslie including better tomorrow .  ,1
it  s one of the funny things about being young that one can be fooled easily by advertising . i have spoken before on another film  in which the commercial for the  comedy  film makes it seem funnier than it is . seeing the ad for this in     made me think this was going to be a wildly funny film . what i and my brother who went and saw it with me didn  t know is that the scene used in the tv ad was the very last scene in the film   br    br   since this scene is the end result of all that came before in the film  i can only guess that there was nothing else funny to use  the last scene is  thanks to a youth potion  dr . fu manchu turns from a long bearded old man  into a bright young asian  elvis like rock star   with back up singers no less    br    br   set for no real reason  in the      s  peter sellers does his best with the material at hand but he  s not given any really good reason for his  comedic  moments . the rest of the actors were just plain dull and my brother and i sat all through this barely laughing at anything . it was only natural that we were expecting a  pink panther  type comedy  peter sellers was so great at that .  br    br   it  s a pitiful shame this was his last film before he died . his appearance on the muppet show was more entertaining than this ill  conceived flop . still  i don  t fault him . i fault everyone else involved for not trying to make a better film of this .  stars is being generous    ,0
i loved watching the original azumi with its mix of live action manga  compelling storyline  cool soundtrack  directing  kitamura rocks    editing  and not to mention the beautiful aya ueto who filled the part perfectly . so i was really looking forward to seeing azumi   but after finally seeing it i felt like i had won the lotto and lost the ticket  azumi  picks up where azumi left off  however these are completely  different movies . the pace is a lot slower  the action is not as exciting and as well choreographed and there is not a lot of character development . this was apparently directed by the same guy responsible for further reducing the value of the toho monster franchise  if that is possible   . i agree with some other past reviewers who say that this was a lost opportunity . if only ryuhei kitamura continued with this installment . there is however some beautiful japanese forest scenery to look at while the slow action unfolds and we are introduced all too briefly to bit characters who quickly get killed off . even the real bad guys  get killed off too easily without too much of a fight . the fight with the spider guy  straight out of an episode of monkey   in the bamboo forest was about the only memorable fight scene . wheras in azumi  we had a climactic fight scene with barrel camera effects  azumi  brought us the azumi cape cam   azumi  s rampage at the end was unconvincing  but aya still does an okay job . she looks great in the cape . . . but where did she get it from  i don  t think i will be watching this one over and over again  . . . what a pity .  ,0
sarah silverman is really the  flavor of the month  comic right now . is she really worth all the hype  yes and no . she is funny at times  sometimes hilariously so  her standup routine is actually quite interesting  though not always funny  . other times  you  re feeling cheated by the media for overhyping yet another performer . she is one of those really cute comedians that men especially flock to  saying that they dig her intelligence and wit . but if you corner them  most men will admit that they just want to sleep with her  and that  s why they watch her . she reminds me of why many men flocked to margaret cho and janeane garofalo  even though neither of them are really  hot  now in terms of popularity . sarah doesn  t drink or smoke  at least cigs   so she should be hot when she  s    so her fans  especially the male ones  can rejoice .  br    br   as for this show  it  s very much like her comedy . when it works  it  s hilarious . when it doesn  t  it  s full blown tedium and very  very boring . the aids episode here is the best one . it  s consistently funny  and has some really good satire in it . brian poeshn  s character has an unhealthy obsession with tab in one episode  and it  s hilarious seeing him in a tab t  shirt . but they never really go anywhere with it  and it eventually wears out its welcome . sarah  s character in the series is rather annoying  the gay couple  brian poeshn and some other guy  seems tacked on and never really does anything for the show as a whole  and the supporting players  including sarah  s real life sister  laura  who doesn  t look a thing like her  are ok . when the jokes hit  they  re brilliant . when they don  t  they  re awful  and i mean really awful . there  s also an obsession with coprophilia here  aka poop jokes   which seems to have replaced actual wit and intelligence in comedy today . so should you watch this show  if you have a crush on sarah  go for it . you can gaze at her and pretend she  s yours . as for her show  it  s ranges from good to absolute zero .  ,0
in      director brian de palma set out to make a film about the rise and fall of an american gangster  and that he did   with the help of a terrific screenplay by oliver stone and some impeccable work by an outstanding cast . the result was scarface   starring al pacino in one of his most memorable roles . the story begins in may of      when castro opened the harbor at mariel  cuba  to allow cuban nationals to join their families in the united states .        left cuba at that time  for the greener pastures of freedom in america  and most were honest  hard  working people  thankful for the opportunity they had been granted . but not all . among the marielitos  who streamed into florida  approximately       had criminal records and were nothing less than the dregs of cuba  s jails   criminals considered beyond redemption  who castro had merely wanted to be rid of . and they  too  saw america as a land of opportunity  even as al capone had considered chicago some fifty years earlier . and among the most ambitious was a man named tony montana  pacino   known to his associates as caracortada .  scarface .  br    br   now that he was free of the yoke of communism under which he had grown up  montana wanted what he felt was coming to him  and he wanted it now and from the moment he stepped off the boat in florida  he was determined to have it all . wealth and power   that was montana  s dream  and he would get it by doing what he did best  beginning with a favor for a man living in miami by the name of frank lopez  robert loggia  . lopez  it seems  had a brother in cuba who had met an untimely end at the hands of one of castro  s goons  a man who  having outlived his usefulness to castro  had been summarily discarded and was currently being held in little havana   along with montana and all of the cubans just off the boats  where they awaited their papers from the government that would effect their transition into their new lives . and in short order  montana sees to it that lopez  s brother has been avenged  and it sets the stage for his own entrance into the underworld of america .  br    br   lopez  a wealthy businessman with the right connections  in return for the favor gets montana and his friend  manny  steven bauer   released from the holding camp  and puts them to work . in his day  capone may have had bootlegging as a means through which to line his coffers with illicit gain  but lopez has the modern day equivalent  and it  s even more lucrative cocaine . lopez takes montana under his wing and indoctrinates him into the life  but once he has a taste of it  montana isn  t satisfied with whatever crumbs lopez sees fit to throw his way  and he sets a course that will take him to where he wants to be at the top .  with a cold  blooded  iron will  montana decides he  ll do whatever it takes to get there  no matter what the cost . but before it  s over  he will realize the price for his dream  and he  ll pay it but for a brief moment  perhaps he will know what it  s like to be the man . and he will also know whether or not it was worth it .  br    br   in step with de palma  s vision  pacino plays montana larger  than  life  and he does it beautifully . from the accent he affects  which he researched thoroughly to make sure he got it right   and he did   to the body language and the attitude  he  s got it all  and it makes montana convincing and very real . what he brings to the role is nuance and style  in a way that few actors  de niro would be one  can . this is definitely not a character that is sympathetic in any way  nor is there anything about montana that you can readily relate to on a personal level but pacino  s screen presence is so strong that it makes him a thoroughly engrossing character  even though it  s hard to become emotionally involved with him . it  s quite simply a dynamic  memorable performance .  br    br   michelle pfeiffer gives a solid performance  as well  in the role that put her on the path to stardom . as elvira  the woman who becomes an integral part of montana  s dream  pfeiffer is subtle and understated  giving that sense of something going on underneath  while affecting a rather cold and distant exterior countenance . she  like pacino  definitely makes her presence felt as she fairly glides across the screen with a stoic  enigmatic and sultry demeanor .  br    br   the supporting cast includes mary elizabeth mastrantonio  gina   miriam colon  mama montana   f . murray abraham  omar   paul shenar  sosa  and harris yulin  bernstein  . an excellent precursor to the more recent and highly acclaimed traffic   and blow   and well as having a climactic scene reminiscent of peckinpah  s the wild bunch   de palma  s scarface   originally panned by critics  has since been cited by many as being the definitive american gangster saga . much of the violence is implied rather than graphic  but this film still has an edge of realism to it that many may find somewhat disturbing . but if you stay with it  there is a lesson to be learned in the end . and like many lessons in life  the most valuable are often the hardest to take at the time . but the reward is always worth it  and that  s the way it is with this film . i rate this one     .  br    br    br    br    br    br    ,1
  a truly nice story with a moral about brotherly love  describes this odd david lynch film . this was especially  odd  because it wasn  t the kind of film lynch had been putting out in the last      years . those were dark and shocking films  blue velvet  wild at heart  mulholland drive  and this is the opposite . i know it disappointed a lot of his fans . others were delighted by it . count me as one of the latter  and i own all three of those  dark  films  too .  br    br   this was another supposed  true life story  here detailing an elderly man  s trip in a seated lawnmower from western iowa all the way to wisconsin to see his ailing brother who he hasn  t talked to in years but wants to see before the latter dies . well  i guess that premise  an old man driving a lawn mower    miles  still makes this an  odd  film of sorts  so lynch stays in character with that   br    br   richard farnsworth plays the title role . he is the type of guy  face  wise  voice  wise  low  key personality  wise  that just about everyone likes . the wrinkles on his face tell many a story . it was so sad to hear what happened to him in real life a year after this film was released .  br    br   the first   minutes of this film isn  t much  and not always pleasant as it shows the main character  s adult and mentally  challenged child  sissy spacek  and her tragic past  but once alvin straight  farnsworth  begins his trip  the story picks up . i played this for several friends and they thought the film never picked up  but i am more generous with it . i think it  s a hidden gem . to them  it was a sleeping pill .  br    br   i found his trip pretty fascinating but you have to realize in advance this is not going to be a suspenseful lynch crime story . it is slow and if that  s okay with you  you might like this . charm enters the picture in some of people alvin meets along the way  such as a wayward young girl running away and some nice town folks who help the old man out when he gets in trouble .  henry cada as  daniel riordan  is a standout in that regard .  harry dean stanton gets third billing  but that  s a joke he  s only in the final few minutes of the movie   br    br   the iowa scenery is pleasant . i lived there for several years and can attest to the rolling hills and the rich soil . it  s a nice state with nice people . . . . like this movie .  ,1
the stone boy is an almost forgotten drama from the     s . considering how many famous or soon to be famous people are in the film  one wonders how it could have been so overlooked . this is a slow  moody  but touching account of a tragedy that befalls a farm family . the film is more or less an indictment of midwestern stoic values and suppression of emotion . the film will not be for all tastes  but anyone who can appreciate real human drama should like it ok .  br    br   in the early moments of the film  we see two brothers head off in the early morning hours to pick some peas and maybe shoot a duck or two if they  re lucky . while climbing through a barbed wire fence  the gun accidentally discharges and the younger boy fatally shoots his older brother . these boys have apparently never taken a hunter safety course . the way for two men to properly go through a fence like this with one gun would be as follows first man climbs through . second man then passes him the gun through the fence . the first man then sets the gun down and helps the other through the fence . at no time should either man have his hands on both the gun and the fence .  br    br   anyway  once his brother is killed     yr  old arnold regresses into his own world . he does not even run for help after his brother is shot . he simply goes ahead and picks the peas and tells his family about the accident later . at no point during the funeral or inquest does arnold seem to show any regret or sorrow at all . his family seems to shun him . perhaps they are even angry at him for killing his brother . an ornery uncle played by frederick forrest is outwardly upset with arnold  even though the older brother  s death allows him to hit on the kid  s girlfriend . arnold  s parents don  t seem to understand how to deal with their son . they really don  t even try to talk to him . about the only person he can communicate with is his grandfather who is played in typical grandfatherly skill by wilford brimley . after a while  arnold even moves in with the old timer .  br    br   nothing seems to get arnold to open up until he takes a bizarre road trip to reno nevada to inexplicably look up his uncle  s ex  wife . once he meets her  he begins to emerge from his shell after apologizing to her for breaking up her marriage by starting all of the family  s turmoil with the accident . from here on  the film becomes a quick study in reconciliation and reawakening .  br    br   the acting is hauntingly distant in most cases . robert duvall and glenn close make the perfect stoic farm parents . forrest is good  but maybe trying too hard to channel paul newman  s performance in hud . the cinematography is exceptional  too . if you like moody pictures about common folk  this one may be for you . some even may be advised to bring some tissues .  of   stars .  br    br   the hound .  ,1
i love memoirs of a geisha so i read the book twice it is one of the best book i  ve read last year . i was looking forward to the movie and was afraid that reading the book would ruin the viewing pleasure of the movie . i wasn  t expecting the movie to be that bad . some of the best part of the book was omitted from the movie and the characters were weak with hatsumomo  li gong  been the worst . if i haven  t read the book  this movie would be a little confusing and inexplicable . the plot outline of the movie states  nitta sayuri reveals how she transcended her fishing . . .  did anyone see how or when sayuri became nitta sayuri  forget the movie and read the book .  ,0
i first saw this film   years ago on n . y . television  and thought it was a depressing look at the future . wells sees restriction of private freedoms as a good thing .   no private airplanes  . the   year plus war in the film was the reason this film was not shown to british film goers doing the war . the concept of the future  and the korda an co . concept of the the machines of the future are the real stars of the film . the very best acting performance is that of ralph richardson as the boss . a combination of winston churchill and edina from absolutely fabulous comedy series . it is interesting to note that the boss  s negative personality is somewhat similar to the war time churchill .  ,1

kind of drawn in by the erotic scenes  only to realize this was one of the most amateurish and unbelievable bits of film i  ve ever seen . sort of like a high school film project . what was rosanna arquette thinking   and what was with all those stock characters in that bizarre supposed midwest town  pretty hard to get involved with this one . no lessons to be learned from it  no brilliant insights  just stilted and quite ridiculous  but lots of skin  if that intrigues you  videotaped nonsense . . . . what was with the bisexual relationship  out of nowhere  after all the heterosexual encounters . and what was with that absurd dance  with everybody playing their stereotyped roles  give this one a pass  it  s like a million other miles of bad  wasted film  money that could have been spent on starving children or aids in africa . . . . .  ,0
i  ve just visited russian forum of our tv  channel that had showed this film . well . . .   per cent of active russian audience is disappointed . we wanted to see more true facts of our space achievements in this film . but authors had in mind something else . . .   we are big and beautiful country with intelligent people living here . we are proud of all our space dreams  real achievements on the one hand in this field and in science on the other hand . so i  d like to ask authors where is our lunohod  and where  the hell our mir station  ah  i  m quite sure  that lunohod events took place much earlier armstrong  s  walk on moon  . and to comment numerous technical and science mistakes  i really have no time and enough space here  se our constructive critics in russian forum on www .  tv . ru  ,0
after the already disappointing  final conflict   the series hits rock  bottom with this very weak fourth entry . at least the third film tried  unsuccessfully  to continue the story of damien  while this one simply rehashes and copies ideas from the  omen   animals are afraid of the antichrist  the death of one man is very similar to the death of the photographer in the first film  . but what looked exciting and creative there looks just dumb here . and the little girl looks simply like a spoiled kid .  ,0
i liked the first movie  but this is a textbook example of a sequel that would have been better of left on the drawing board . the general idea in the first movie was  if not great  then at least very interesting . this sequel tries to build upon the idea and the characters from the first movie  and though christopher walken is still good as gabriel  the whole idea suddenly gets a bit ridiculous . if you haven  t seen any of these movies  then get the first movie and forget about the sequels  they can take away all of the joy from the original .  ,0
i enjoy ralph bakshi films   wizards    cool world  and the underrated animated  lord of the rings   and am a frank frazetta collector and fan . i am also a sword and sorcery fan who loves the worlds of edgar rice burroughs and robert e . howard .  br    br   i missed  fire and ice  s  theatrical release back in     and have looked forward to seeing it on video or at some revival ever since then . therefore the     release was a dream come true for me . however  i bought it with some trepidation  because i hoped it would not be only worth watching once and then put on the shelf as a  collectible  gathering dust until the day i died . fortunately my fears were groundless and i was pleasantly impressed with this movie .  br    br   as with frazetta art this is a gritty film that has a physicality and sexuality that is hard to find in most fantasy  sword and sorcery films without being cheesy or dirty . the art is good and you see glimpses of frazetta at his best . even my young boys loved watching it with me and ask to watch it again and again . however  my wife has some objections due to the scantily clad princess  very frazetta  esquire  . i don  t mind that because it is believable and there is no sex scene .  br    br   there is roto  scoping used  but personally i enjoy roto  scoping . it gives more fluid and realistic movements to the characters that is hard to find in animation .  br    br   despite some continuity problems  i recommend this film to all bakshi  frazetta  conan  and sword and sorcery fans . enjoy   ,1

escaping the life of being pimped by her father  . . and the speakeasy waitressing  who dies in an explosion  lily powers  barbara stanwyck  who is simply ravishing  sluts her way through the branches inside a bank business in big city gotham . when a possessive lover murders who was supposed to be his next father  in  law  and lily  s new lover   the sky  s the limit for lily as she has written down her various relationships in a diary and subtlety makes it known the papers will receive it if certain pay doesn  t come into her hands . newly appointed president to the bank  courtland trenholm  george brent   sends lily to paris instead of forking over lots of dough  but soon finds himself madly in love after various encounters with her in the city of love . this makes lily  s mouth water as now she  ll have reached the pedestal of success seducing a man of wealth and prestige bring riches her way . though  circumstances ensue which will bring her to make a decision that threatens her successful way of achieving those riches . . trenholm  now her husband  is being indicted with jail certain and has lost the bank . he needs money lily now has in her possession or he  ll have absolutely nothing .  br    br   stanwyck is the whole movie despite that usual warner brothers polish . being set in the pre  code era gives the filmmakers the chance to elaborate on taboo subjects such as a woman using sex to achieve success and how that can lead to tragedy . good direction from alfred e green shows through subtlety hints in different mannerisms and speech through good acting from the seductive performance of stanwyck how to stage something without actually showing the explicit act . obviously the film shows that money isn  t everything and all that jazz as love comes into the heart of lily  s dead heart . that ending having lily achieve the miraculous metamorphosis into someone in love didn  t ring true to me . she  s spent all this time to get to that platform only to fall for a man who was essentially no different than others she had used before him .  ,1
i have just managed to get hold of the celestial region  dvd of the five venoms and what a super job they have made of it . a fantastic digitally remastered transfer and a must have for any kung fu fan .  br    br   the story is pretty straight forward  and has been mentioned already so i won  t go into it again . needless to say it  s the fight scenes that many buy the movie for  and they do not disappoint . only problem is they are a bit few and far between and seem over rehearsed . bruce lee could take these lot on and drink a cup of tea at the same time  all kicks and punches come with the all important  type writer  clicks and air  whooshes   which is a cool effect though quite amusing   br    br   i give this movie a b . good but not great . in a way i feel it could have been that bit better . golden swallow  by the same director a decade earlier  had as good a story and better action .  ,1
this movie was just plain dumb i do not think it was scary at all i went in hoping to be shocked and scared but was mostly laughing some of the scenes were just to fake and thrown together blood scenes were extremely over cg and some of the mutants were ridiculously gay looking it also sucked because the acting was just plain horrible u think they could get some good actors and most of the characters i hated just because how stupid and lame they acted even though they were supposed to be in the military i get to watch movies for free and seen many people walking out im guessing because it was so dumb kinda glad i didn  t have to pay for it in short dumb ass movie don  t see it . . . but then again thats my opinion  ,0
the final film for ernst lubitsch  completed by otto preminger after lubitsch  s untimely death during production  is a juggling act of sophistication and silliness  romance and music  fantasy and costume dramatics . in a   th century castle in southeastern europe  a countess falls for her sworn enemy  the leader of the hungarian revolt she  s aided by her ancestor  whose painted image magically comes to life . betty grable  in a long blonde wig adorned with flowers  has never been more beautiful  and her songs are very pleasant . unfortunately  this script  by samson raphaelson  taken from an operetta by rudolf schanzer and e . welisch  is awash with different ideas that fail to mesh   or entertain . the results are good  looking  but unabsorbing .     from   ,0
the more i analyze this film  the worse it becomes . first of all  why a motivational speaker  that part was just stupid . i mean  why would a megalomaniac trying to control the world rely on a motivational speaker  is alexander stone really that disorganized  first he can  t decide what he wants to do to control the world  so he looks to the bible for ideas . many of these ideas  i might add  really have no reliability  for example  the part of the  the houses of ishmael and isaac shall scream out in terror  could have already happened . it could have been have been the synagogues burned during krystalnacht and the mosques could very well have been the mosques blown up in baghdad or something .  and gillen lane  s family  they had no part except to provide a family values platfrom and dab their eyes with water  i might add that since casper van dien  gillen lane is only in his twenties  or that  s the impression that i had  and has a ten year child  he had his child during high school . yeah  there goes tbn  s family values . also  why did this film have to be so damn propaganda  like  i  ll repeat what an earlier reviewer said . the indiana jones flicks use christian mythology as a plot dvice and manipulate it well so that we are intoxicated . this film doesn  t do that . the beginnig starts off well  with michael ironsides playing a priest who murders a scholar off some sort and steals the dead guy  s omega code . then when confronted by two men who he is obviously afraid of  the two prophets tell him  tell your master that we are here   . dominic  ironsides  replies  he already knows  and points to a small surveillance camera . that part sent chills up my spine . had only it gone on like that one scene i would have loved this film . i  ll give michael york credit he does a fine job of acting out his character  as does michael ironsides . but the good guys are horrible . i  ve already went on about lane  s family  br    br   . now that i  m over the acting  i  ll get on to plot . this is obviously a baptist film  since our beloved pope of the vatican is portrayed as an oaf . the world domination plot i liked and found plausible and subtle  as were the action sequences were also thrilling and well  done . also another diatribe against the vatican  their leaders are seen as dogmatically minded  since gillen explains to the pope that it  s not the end of the world  but the beginning of a new one also  the vatican  or israelis  says their going to secede from the world union aince they used the omega code to control the world . whoever it was  they wouldn  t just secede  they  d send over commandoes and kill them . this is the equivalent of america knowing about the kgb going to kill the president and simply saying  we  re not going to talk to you any more   . come on  i did enjoy the scenes where we see bombers headed towards israel and see them again on the monitor . mediocre in short .  ,0
luckily i did not pay to see this movie . also  i cannot even reveal any spoilers because i willingly walked out after forty minutes of the movie . it was that bad . i laughed once  when the yahoo  billboard fell on the guy  and the theme song came on . however  that was only because i thought it was making fun of it  but then i realized it was yet another product placement .  br    br   i loved the cartoon . i used to watch it almost religiously .  although i missed the last episode . i heard that they show dr . claw and it was nothing more than a claw  somebody comment on the show  s page  the cartoon had penny and brain alot more than the movie had  as to that point . i hated the setup of the whole thing  reminiscent of robocop . then broderick screws with the whole feeling of inspector gadget . he is not nearly as clumsy as the cartoon was . another fact is his gadgets actually work to the point i saw  except for the oil slick . he also screwed with the tone of  wowsers  which used to be in an excited tone . i felt so disappointed that they slaughtered the cartoon so badly . everybody else felt that way too . us      year olds remember the cartoon fondly and we loved every minute of it .  br    br   i went into the movie with an open mind  knowing that they would have screwed with the cartoon . i was taken aback at how retarded the movie was . it relied on sight gags  and stupid dialogue for humor . disney relies on pain and physical humor to push a kids movie along . product placement is pointless in this film  and it shows . the wise  cracking car is not that good at cracking wise . the gadgets look nice  but they were almost overly glossy . the cartoon was a better look . the silly scenes were crap . in the      minutes i watched the movie  not one laugh was heard  and they laughed at the dudley  do  right preview . this movie should not be watched by people who want intelligence in their family entertainment . i highly recommend  the iron giant   which was sad  but very very good . this movie is a travesty to the whole family drama .               ,0
a never ending frenzy of clever visual ironies does not necessarily create an engaging film . the  blonde wig  half of the movie never took off perhaps due to too much self  indulgence by its makers .  br    br   the wong faye half  featuring a very playful  if karen carpenter looking  faye wong  holds much more appeal . all the ingredients are there  however  the girl  meets  boy story element takes a back seat to artsy cleverness . character development is uneven . emotion is missing .  br    br   for music lovers  wong faye  s  mung jung yun   cantonese version of the cranberry  s smash hit  dreams   is used effectively in chungking express . faye wong also recorded a mandarin language version called  zhen tuo .  both are on cd  although only  mung jung yun  is found on the official movie soundtrack cd .  ,0
marlene dietrich and charles boyer give solid performances in this beautiful but empty film . the irony is that dietrich plays a woman with a beautiful but empty life . truly gorgeous cinematography and sets  and yes dietrich  s bottomless trunk of clothes are also fabulous . she look great boyer looks young and trim .  br    br   story of a woman seeking meaning and an ex  priest seeking life seems pretty stale  but set against such unreal sets and skies it somehow works  given the two stars  the terrific score by max steiner  and a good supporting cast . the film runs like   minutes and seems badly edited  plus certain characters just appear or disappear .  br    br   joseph schildkraut is funny as the arab guide  c . aubrey smith is the old priest  lucile watson the mother superior  tilly losch the dancer  john carradine the diviner  and basil rathbone plays . . . . well i  m not sure . he just rides in from the desert and spoils everything  as others have noted  john gilbert was slated to star with dietrich . i can  t help but think he would have been wonderful . the role of world  weary boris would have suited the great gilbert quite well . and after the success of queen christina  with garbo   his career might have gotten back on track .  br    br   i can  t think of any other   s film dietrich did in color . she looks great and wears some terrific clothes . my favorite is the valentino as the shiek  like outfit she wears by the pool .  br    br   certainly worth a look for the lush sets and color and the two great stars .  ,1
i watched this on the tube last night . the actor  s involved first caught my attention . the first scenes were attention getters . some funny some sad . good character development . i felt that the latter third of the film diverged . if it was not for the early part of the movie i would have stopped watching . i kept watching wanting to how how it tied together .  br    br   unfortunately i feel that it never happened . i especially did not like the extend period that several of the character were talking yiddish    . was that the other shoe   br    br   would i recommend  no  i think not . as other reviewers mention much of the slang is dated     s jive  but it was not too distracting . the ending totally turned me off .  ,0
i absolutely love this show  but i saw the second episode first . after watching the first episode i could see why people were turned off at first . the first episode  s humor is not the best  and they struggle to properly start the series . however  i still like the light and humorous attitude of the show . the characters develop much more after the episode and become truly enjoyable characters . as a first episode  it really doesn  t accurately represent the rest of the show which is really quite good . the episode is not bad by any means  but as the show progresses it becomes better and better  so watch more episodes before passing any judgement on the quality of the show .  ,1
musically speaking irving berlin gave fred astaire and ginger rogers another pluperfect musical after top hat if that was possible . although in this case like that jerome kern confection roberta that they were in  follow the fleet retained randolph scott with another singer  this time harriet hilliard .  br    br   randolph scott is a career navy cpo and fred astaire is an ex  vaudevillian who enlisted in the navy to forget ginger rogers his former partner . but now the two are on shore leave . fred and ginger take up right where they left off  and randy accidentally meets ginger  s dowdy sister harriet who blossoms into a real beauty . but randy  s a typical love  em and leave  em sailor .  br    br   again irving berlin wrote a hit filled score with him tightly supervising the production . ginger gets to do some really outstanding vocalizing with let yourself go which she and fred later dance to . but the real hit of the show is let  s face the music and dance which is a number done at a navy show . sung first by astaire and later danced to by the pair  let  s face the music and dance is one of the great romantic numbers ever written for the screen . their dancing on this one is absolute magic .  br    br   i  m sure that when i mention harriet hilliard a few younger people might ask who that was . but they will know immediately when i mention her in conjunction with her famous husband ozzie nelson . that  s right ozzie and harriet . it  s something of a mystery to me why harriet stopped singing when she just became david and ricky  s mom on television . then again she didn  t even keep her own name .  br    br   neither ozzie or harriet sang on television . ozzie was a pale imitation of rudy vallee as a singer  but harriet could really carry a tune . she sings get thee behind me satan and the moon and i are here  but where are you  both with real feeling and class . i recommend you see follow the fleet if for no other reason than to hear a dimension of harriet hilliard incredibly forgotten today .  ,1

for those who  d like to see this movie  i  d say go  without the narration it might be a very good movie  documentary . but the music  the narration and some of the implemented story lines make it very hard to watch for a sceptic person like me . following several animals  their life in several seasons one gets the feeling that it is an animal soap we  re watching . but the melodramatic point of view just doesn  t cut it for me  moreover if a predator finally catches up on a prey  one exception left there  the camera zooms out or skips to another scene . i ask myself why that happens  if they were to show reality  why cut the scenes that a melodramatic fairytale remains  i think the moral is important for the mass of the crowd  cause after all it would be a waste to destroy this beautiful planet .  ,0
a stuttering plot  uninteresting characters and sub  par  to say the least  dialogue plagues this tv production that could hardly have been interesting even with a billion dollar production budget .  br    br   the characters aren  t believable  in their motives  actions or their professed occupations . the plot reads like a bad dungeons and dragons  tm  hack but with plasma rifles and force fields . there are severe continuity issues and the degree of pointless interaction between the characters has this author  at least  wincing .  br    br   avoid it like the plague . watch any episode of dark angel and you will have better acting  dialogue and plot . yuck .  ,0
the plot of  house of games  is the strongest thing about it a successful author and psychologist is conned by a gang of grifters  but in discovering the wicked part of herself that enjoys the thrill of what they do  she finally gets her revenge . that  s about the pitch but someone has to take responsibility for it coming across as being acted by puppets . it has to be the director mamet lindsay crouse has had a varied and pretty steady tv and film career  so she can  t perform this badly all the time . she  s supposed to go from uptight  cool  controlled professional to calculating  wicked fast lady having fun  as shown by the change from beige trouser suit  which she seems to wear for three days straight  including underwear  to floppy floral sundress . but everyone seems to be speaking their lines the same clipped  precise way i imagine mamet wanting to make sure not a syllable of his scintillating script got missed . the effect is unsettling and spoils the atmosphere of mystery and suspense he is presumably trying to create . at times  house of games  loses any connection to how human beings actually behave or talk  and becomes just a mechanism to spin out the plot . the clunky vibes  n  oboe faux  jazz soundtrack doesn  t help either . the ultimate result is that the only entertainment to be had is in guessing the outcome  and the sooner you do that the sooner you will get bored with the robotic  two  dimensional performances . and they smoke too much     ,0

  br    br   back in his youth  the old man had wanted to marry his first cousin  but his family forbid it . many decades later  the old man has raised three children  two boys and one girl   and allows his son and daughter to marry and have children . soon  the sister is bored with brother    and jumps in the bed of brother   .  br    br   one might think that the three siblings are stuck somewhere on a remote island . but no   they are upper class europeans going to college and busy in the social world .  br    br   never do we see a flirtatious moment between any non  related female and the two brothers . never do we see any flirtatious moment between any non  related male and the one sister . all flirtatious moments are shared between only between the brothers and sister .  br    br   the weakest part of gladiator was the incest thing . the young emperor commodus would have hundreds of slave girls and a city full of marriage  minded girls all over him  but no   he only wanted his sister  if movie incest is your cup of tea  then sunshine will  slowly  thrill you to no end .  ,0
odd slasher movie from producer charles band . in the days of full moon  s greatest success band said that he would never make  real killer films  because he felt that little puppets and big monsters added a fantasy element that made the films better  people killing each other is thus real and less fun . a nice philosophy and a true shame that band  having destroyed the full moon studio through possible shoddy business dealings became so desperate for home cinema profits that he started making exactly what the likes of blockbuster wanted and therefore sacrificed creativity and originality . the team behind this one also worked on  delta delta die   and  birth rite   both equally bland by full moon standards . debbie rochon is on usual top form here as a newbie to a gang of dudes and dudettes who decide to make up a story about a  murder club  . she  as one would obviously  does all she can to join and then panic sets in because it was not a true story and silly ms rochon believed it and now everybody will have to run around getting covered in blood and maybe killing each other or maybe not . the choice is there  s and with regard to this movie its yours . . . not recommended but not entirely bad either .  ,0
this is my kind of film . i am fascinated by strange psychotic nightmares and this movie is just that . but it is also a dark comedy . while i see it mostly as a horror  thriller  there will be others who might see it as a black dramatic comedy .  br    br   but either way  it is a fascinating descent into madness . the ending caught me off guard  but what an ending  it leaves the viewer a lot to think about .  br    br   powerful performances  a complex and detailed plot  a great script filled with dread and dashes of humor  and an eerie atmosphere make this a film worth watching .  br    br   personally  i think that i will need to watch this several more times to pick up and understand all the subtleties that are within . but it is such a film that it will be a pleasure and not a chore so to do .  ,1
so  has it really come to this  are we  as consenting adults  to blame for the next generation of cinema  goers lack of cinematic understanding and celluloid capability  concerning the wayans and co . latest addition to the moving pictures scenario little man . this united kingdom p . g .  parental guidance   anyone under the age of twelve must be accompanied by a responsible adult  certificated movie  is the epitome of what has now developed into the worse case of dumbing down since cigarettes were  wiped out  from pictures of movie icons of the      s .  br    br   the predominantly under twelve  s audience here who  some without grown up supervision too  sat there  obediently  taking it all in  oblivious to their subject and the partly grown up features that little man portrays  in part at least too . movies  in general  can do better than this poor attempt  while this nonsense is getting them in while they are still young and fresh  the biggest fear for the future of cinema is that a child  s ignorance just might carry on through to a grown up bliss . cinema deserves more than this  and so do its ever growing  and in the literal sense too  audiences  this blatant cash cow feeds on the ever  impressionable minds of the young .  br    br   there is no cinema experience here  no open eyed wonder  no awe  inspiring respect to the magic of movies  . there is nothing but bewilderment and contempt  for the lack of substance  originality and its delivery of mind less tedium and parody of everything that is so now ultimately wrong with the hollywood machine  for the sake of a quick buck  we must endure our future cinema audiences to the likes of this archetypal disaster movie .  br    br   will this have the likes of hitchcock  fassbinder  leone  kubrick and schaffner reeling in their graves  money they all liked  no doubt  but talent and exuberance for perfection and quality  and to a vast degree  respect for their profession and audience  they were never short off . we are seeing  once again  with the works of the wayans clan another clich of bad taste  while the likes of white chicks       were in no doubt a stab at the bourgeoisie of american society . the irony here is that the two leading protagonists  played yet again  by the wayans brothers  are so much undercover  that all recognition is non  existent  this makes for a better movie too  and it is the actor terry crews that gives white chicks its substance and personality  not the wayans .  br    br   yet again  with their pastiche of      s blaxploitation movies  as with the     movie i  m gonna git you sucka  this to can be seen as a comical and amusing movie  with heavy weights as isaac hayes  jim brown  bernie casey and the gorgeous actress ja  net du bois . the point being  that little man has absolutely no persona of any kind what so ever  he is shallow and narcissistic  with no appreciation or value toward his followers  he quickly dives in takes your money and before we know it  has hidden himself within the cogs of commercialism . there is no recognisable effort as to where our money has been spent  after scary movie        things could only have gone up  but alas they did not  no great pondering of artistic value and no doubt that the instalment from these intrepid movie moguls  next movies shall be straight to video  one can only hope .  br    br   the wayans seem to have created a movie genre all by themselves  to a certain extent they have bludgeoned to death the movie parody  they have watered down each and every avenue and with their inevitable style . they have slowly destroyed the reputation of the last one hundred years that cinema have given us  may the ghosts of movies past be ever so humble in their judgement  as their growing audiences  so far  seem to be  for when the bubble bursts  may they be as understanding too .  ,0
i  m writing this because i somehow felt being led to believe dark remains was a good movie . whilst it  s not the worst i  ve seen  it certainly isn  t good .  br    br   a weak script  weak actors  and weak directing . even if they can  t afford big name cast  would it be too much to ask for a more attractive lead actress  it was painful to watch a plain actress through out the film with her dull performance . the story was a clich and poorly scripted . the special effects were minimal . the  suspense  tricks employed repetitively here were hard to swallow .  br    br   to be fair  dark remains is no worse than quite some of the masters of horrors  episodes . but not quite on par with quality movies yet . dark remains is only recommended for the hardcore horror fans who don  t want to miss any movie in the genre  even if it  s a poorly made one . as for anyone else  time should be spent on something more valuable  which should be extremely easy .  ,0
they had me from the first show .  br    br   welcome to trinity county . a sleepy little mayberry  like place with one slight difference . the sheriff is really satan . there  s the spoiler . not like you wouldn  t figure it out in   minutes anyway .  br    br   oh  but that  s not all . it turns out that satan has a son named caleb . some people are trying to keep him good  but it  s an uphill battle . sheriff buck  satan  knows who caleb is and likes to spend time with him teaching him the ways of darkness . subtle . sneaky . he doesn  t always come off as evil . most of the time he  s a hero . everyone owes him a big favor  because he often sets up a calamity and saves them from it . so every time you think someone will finally take him down  one of his friends comes out of nowhere to sabotage it .  br    br   in one of my favorite episodes  lucas and caleb were out in the woods in a cabin and some guys with guns decided to rob them . lucas used it as an excuse to teach caleb a lesson about evil .  br    br   the robber  ted  was hesitant to shoot them . lucas told caleb that ted had half a conscience . if he had no conscience  he would have shot them by now . if he had a real conscience  he never would have become a criminal . so he started calling him half  ted . it was pretty funny . he was taunting the criminals . and of course he stayed   steps ahead of half  ted at all times . and of course he was in complete control at all times . they actually had you favoring satan .  br    br   very very excellent show . it was one of my favorite horror shows of all time . twilight zone night stalker circle of fear american gothic supernatural  br    br   that  s good company .  ,1
i liked chiba in street fighter  and i figured hey  no matter how stupid this movie will be  i  ll at least get to see him kick some ass  right  wrong . this is a dull  dreary mess of pointless talking  half  assed scriptwriting and meaningless scheming . there are few action scenes of any kind  even fewer martial arts scenes  and the few that are are shot and edited so poorly that you can  t even make out what in the world is going on . the dub is also atrocious  and perhaps the idiocy that is this movie is best illustrated by the fact that it supposedly features the italian mafia . . . except they  re all japanese  avoid like the plague   you would see better martial arts by looking through the window of your local preschool karate class for five minutes .  ,0
this movie was a mess . it had the absolute worst editing i have ever seen . it was almost like at the end of a scene the writer wanted to go to commercial  and the filmmaker added a second of black screen to fulfill the writers dream .  br    br   under the messy direction and editing  there was a glimmer of something good . a good idea  a compelling spark . but somewhere it went wrong .  br    br   the story is about a quasi  psychic priest who is trying to solve a string of murders . the first thing that is hard to bite into is richard grieco as a priest . well the part doesn  t call for him to be a good priest and he succeeds rather well . the second problem is dennis hopper as the crazy bad guy . he always plays the crazy bad guy . very ho hum .  br    br   oh  a thought occured to me that maybe all the jumpy  horrible editing and disconnected plot was trying to add a sense of the confusion the character  grieco  was experiencing . and just to prove that it was contrived they rolled the credits backwords . not a good sign for any movie .  br    br    ,0
i couldn  t relate to this film . it failed to engage me either intellectually  emotionally or aesthetically . the dialogue was very dense and uninvolving . i couldn  t connect with and hence care about any of the characters and i  m finding it hard to find much that  s positive to say about it .  br    br   i  ve read that to understand it properly one needs to be familiar with some of the more obscure aspects of catholic theology . i  ll admit that  as an atheist  i probably am unfamiliar with many of the finer details of catholicism  but i have also seen many films dealing with religious issues that have touched me because their themes are still universal to the human condition and don  t rely on specialised knowledge or beliefs .  ,0
a fantastic arabian adventure . a former king  ahmad  and his best friend  the thief abu  played by sabu of black narcissus  search for ahmad  s love interest  who has been stolen by the new king  jaffar  conrad veidt  . there  s hardly a down moment here . it  s always inventing new adventures for the heroes . personally  i found ahmad and his princess a little boring  there  s no need to ask why john justin  who plays ahmad  is listed fourth in the credits  . conrad veidt  always a fun actor  makes a great villain  and sabu is a lot of fun as the prince of thieves  who at one point finds a genie in a bottle . i also really loved miles malleson as the sultan of basra  the father of the princess . he collects amazing toys from around the world . jaffar bribes him for his daughter  s hand with a mechanical flying horse . this probably would count as one of the great children  s films of all time  but the special effects are horribly dated nowadays . kids will certainly deride the superimposed images when abu and the genie are on screen together . and the scene with the giant spider looks especially awful . although most of the younger generation probably thinks that king kong looks bad at this point in time  willis o  brien  s stop  motion animation is a thousand times better than a puppet on a string that doesn  t even look remotely like a spider .     .  ,1
the most moving and truly eye opening documentary ever created . i cried the whole way through  from start to end . watching the show you are immediately captured by a man  s struggle to live without pain  to live a life we would take for granted . the first time i heard the title  i was almost scared to see the program  it was hard for me to comprehend living in agony every day of every year of my life . i truly felt for him . the saddest part of the documentary is when jonny picks out his coffin . could you imagine doing that  even more so  even though he was in excruciating and unbearable pain he still opened up his own charity .  debra  jonny is one of the only people that deserves true respect and admiration  he is the definition of a role model  what a true and undeniable hero he was   ,1
what a waste of time and money  my hubby and i saw this movie  after seeing the previews and thinking it  might be funny  . wrong  this movie is about   minutes too long . the actors are trapped in a poorly written script and can  t get out . the jokes are weak and tired  and not even seeing wilson  s naked behind can redeem any part of this film . the special effects . . . . . aren  t . i half expected to see the harness and wires holding up uma in her flying scenes . and when the effects people apparently could not master the superhero  s faster  than  a  speeding  bullet flying or fight scenes  they covered over everything with a swirling vortex of blurred screen  which hid the awful effects quite nicely . wilson  s sidekick was a lame excuse for a man and wilson had no chemistry with either uma or his office co  worker . the sex scenes weren  t sexy and the funny scenes weren  t funny . i guess i just expected too much from these actors . none of the characters were really sympathetic  so i ended up not caring a flying fig about any of them . the only memorable performances were the kids who played bedlam and g  girl as teenagers  at least they had some chemistry . overall  a super stinko movie  i wouldn  t even recommend it as a rental  it would still be a waste of money   ,0
this film has nothing whatever to do with the sphinx  and the title is just a come  on . the story concerns an imagined true and concealed tomb in the valley of the kings  of king seti i  second pharaoh of the   th dynasty  new kingdom period . it is not a bad yarn  and a great deal of the film is shot on location . even the scenes in the winter palace hotel lobby in luxor were really shot there  and not in a studio . the second unit stuff is endless  and they must have been let loose on egypt for weeks . frank langella is very good indeed as a sophisticated egyptian . he should take it up as a sideline . the film is essentially ruined by one of the world  s most irritating actresses  lesley anne down  who plays the lead . she spends the whole film wondering how she looks  are her blue eyes refracting light at the correct angle  do all the fellas lust after her  etc . having started life as a model at the age of ten  what hope could there be for her  she epitomises everything that is most revolting about female vanity and dim  witted inanity . and to think that this film was directed by franklin shaffner  who won an oscar for  patton   he allows this terrible actress to whimper and simper through the film  hysterical one moment  flirting the next  in a kind of hurricane of idiocy as she reels from one man to another  either screaming or making bedroom eyes  it matters not . she is supposed to be a young egyptologist . but she has never been to egypt before  she takes a taxi to giza and catching her first glimpse of the pyramids  gushes in ecstasy  but they  re so big      barf  ok  so that was the script  but she takes to the banality too readily  giving the impression that it is her natural element  which i don  t doubt for a minute . elements of the story are sound . there is  indeed  a serious problem about a black market in antiquities there . true  well done  the novel by robin cook  which i have not seen  may be ok for all i know . it was fun to see the name of cyril swern as sound recordist on the film  as i knew him pretty well long ago . stanley kubrick  s step  daughter katharina is described as  draughtswoman  . i wonder what that means  maybe she did some set work . anyway  the antiquities in the film are pretty good  actually . and we get to see lots of the cairo museum and numerous scenic locations . they actually go inside king tutankhamun  s tomb  i don  t imagine that would be allowed today for a movie . a lot of inappropriate scenes take place in mosques . that would not go down well today  but in     such things were not on the agenda . the music for the film is absolutely appalling  worse than lesley anne down in fact  but there were sound track elements which were surprisingly authentic  one being the cacophony of traffic noise of cairo  which is accurately rendered in the background  and would make anyone who knows cairo chuckle nervously . also  the loudspeaker calls to prayer are there the whole time  another touch of authenticity . why didn  t they get this right  it could have been good .  ,0
i  m going to spend as much time on this review as the writers did on the script . this is easily the worst sequel ever made .  br    br   they killed navin johnson . not only was mark blankfield  s performance god  awful  so was everyone elses   the physical comedy was forced  flat and predictable . the script seemed to have been written by mongoloid monkeys using the pen names ziggy steinberg and rocco urbisci . how the producers managed to squeeze out such vile cinematic excrement is beyond me . they even managed to make veteran actor ray walston look like a talent  less buffoon . director michael schultz should be ashamed of himself .  br    br   i want the   minutes of my life i spent watching this befouled memory of a brilliant comedy back so i can try and convict everyone involved for this cinematic atrocity .  ,0
okay  the film festival crowd probably loved it . but your average  popcorn munching movie goer who has scraped to  gether the ten or fifteen bucks it costs to see a movie these days will probably wonder why he or she made this choice . if it  s stamped  copolla  it  s automatically great stuff  right  wrong  it  s a neat spoof of filmdom  s pretensions . but it  s terribly  in .  i worry when film makers are more concerned about entertaining themselves rather than the public . it  s interesting as a cinematic curio and it does have a chuckle or two in it . but once it  s run its course in the movies and on tv  the dust will grow thick on the film cans and tape boxes holding it . hardly either epochal or an epic   ,0
i have to say i was really looking forward on watching this film and finding some new life in it that would separate it from most dull and overly crafted mexican films . i have no idea why but i trusted sexo  pudor y lagrimas to be the one to inject freshness and confidence to our non  existent industry . maybe it was because the soundtrack  which i listened to before i saw the film  sounded different from others  maybe it was because it dared to include newer faces  apart from demian bichir who is always a favorite of mexican film directors  and supposedly dealed within it  s script with modern social behaviour  maybe because it  s photography i saw in the trailers was bright and realistic instead of theatrical . the film turned out to be a major crowd pleaser  and a major letdown . what serrano actually deals here with is the very old fashioned  battle of the sexes  as in  all men are the same  and  why is it that all women . . .   blah  blah  blah . nothing new in it  not even that  it uses so much common ground and clich that it eventually mocks itself without leaving any valuable reflexion on the female  male condition . full of usual tramps on the audience like safe gags about the clichs i talked about before  those always work  always  and screaming performances  it is a well acted film in it  s context  . . and by screaming i mean  literally . the at first more compelling characters played by monica dionne and demian bichir turn out to be according to serrano the more pathetic ones . i completely disagree with serrano  they shouldn  t have been treated that way only to serve as marionettes for his lesson to come through . . . he made sure we got his message and completely destroyed their roles that were the only solid ground in which this story could have stood . anyway  it is after all  a very entertaining film at times and you will probably have a good time seeing it  if you accept to be manipulated by it  .  ,0
this is a thinking man  s silly movie . if you don  t expect star wars and enjoy british humor this might just turn into a cult classic for you as it has for my wife and i  from casting the  voice  of cary grant and jack nicholson as martians to the overly simplistic populace of big bean this is a movie that you can either sleep through or watch carefully and enjoy either way .  br    br   it  s not for everyone  but if you enjoy relaxing easy humor that takes a quick mind to see the joke as it slips by you will enjoy this movie .  ,1
one used to say  concerning nathaniel hawthorne  that his failures were more interesting than his successes . i believe that the same remark could suit to mcdonald  eddy  s pictures . and especially this one .  br    br   it apparently possesses many characteristics of a failed movie it  s kitsch  the script  because of censorship  sounds inconsistent yet  this movie gets also some good points good rodgers  hart  s music   i married an angel    tira tira tira la    good acting with e . e . horton and reginald owen .  br    br   anyway  if you may dislike it  you can  t forget it . this strange movie actually leaves a very strong  dreamlike  impression  and you are very likely to keep it in mind for days  maybe for weeks . why  in the thirties and the beginning of the forties  movies didn  t have the same mean than today it aimed  like a dream  to divert the public in order to make it forget a difficult reality . of all the the dream  movies that was made  in that time  this one stands as particularly powerful .  br    br   in short  let  s say that the better way to appreciate this movie  is to watch it without wondering whether it  s good or bad . to watch it  like you would watch a dream .  ,1
this is a film which should be seen by anybody interested in  effected by  or suffering from an eating disorder . it is an amazingly accurate and sensitive portrayal of bulimia in a teenage girl  its causes and its symptoms . the girl is played by one of the most brilliant young actresses working in cinema today  alison lohman  who was later so spectacular in  where the truth lies  . i would recommend that this film be shown in all schools  as you will never see a better on this subject . alison lohman is absolutely outstanding  and one marvels at her ability to convey the anguish of a girl suffering from this compulsive disorder . if barometers tell us the air pressure  alison lohman tells us the emotional pressure with the same degree of accuracy . her emotional range is so precise  each scene could be measured microscopically for its gradations of trauma  on a scale of rising hysteria and desperation which reaches unbearable intensity . mare winningham is the perfect choice to play her mother  and does so with immense sympathy and a range of emotions just as finely tuned as lohman  s . together  they make a pair of sensitive emotional oscillators vibrating in resonance with one another . this film is really an astonishing achievement  and director katt shea should be proud of it . the only reason for not seeing it is if you are not interested in people . but even if you like nature films best  this is after all animal behaviour at the sharp edge . bulimia is an extreme version of how a tormented soul can destroy her own body in a frenzy of despair . and if we don  t sympathise with people suffering from the depths of despair  then we are dead inside .  ,1
the western society has been fed ideas about india being a poor country . movies like these only make those beliefs stronger . such illustrations make it all the more difficult for indians to be accepted abroad . agreed there are poor and homeless in india  but why is there no representation of educated people if not the successful ones .  br    br   i totally hated the idea of the movie portraying patrick swayze as another mother teressa . in my opinion this movie has shown india in a very bad light giving wrong notions . it is unjust to discuss only one aspect of the society . exactly the reason why people ask me   when we go to india  can we hire an elephant right outside the airport so we do not have to walk on the roads so full of filth and snakes    br    br   those who want a second opinion on contemporary indian society should watch  monsoon wedding  .  ,0
this wasn  t really a very good movie . there were lots of implausible and predictable things that happened during the course of the film . . . but i think that most of the reviewers are missing the point of why this movie should be enjoyed by a wide audience . this movie was produced by magic johnson  isn  t that enough to inspire us all to check out this film  a film produced by a former nba star doesn  t come along every day  you know . beautifully stupid kids in a big house getting slashed by an axe wielding psycho . every clich trotted out for us to groan over . teen sex . and it was all produced by magic johnson  i can  t say enough about this movie  teen drug use  college hijinx  and it was all produced by magic johnson  yippeeee   ,0
this may be the worst show i  ve ever seen . aside from the tastelessness of having a sitcom about hitler  it just isn  t funny or entertaining in any way . it is very similar to a      s sitcom in its cornball humor and contrived situations  but while it can be well done like in i love lucy  it  s just not funny here . i think the show was based around the novelty  look  it  s hitler as a bumbling sitcom figure  but it just fell flat in every regard . the guy playing hitler is so hammy that its hard to sit through that alone . i wonder what could have possibly made the network think this was a good idea to air . i thought america had some tasteless show  but the brits had us beat this time . america would never air a sitcom about hitler  although we did have that show about lincoln  s slave  the secret diary of desmond pfeiffer . chances are you  ll probably never see this show  since it only aired one episode and will probably never be released on dvd .  ,0
this was a marvelously funny comedy with a great cast . john ritter and katey sagal were perfectly cast as the parents  and the kids were great too . kaley cuoco was a good choice to play bridget  who was sort of a toned  down version of kelly bundy from married with children . the writing and performances were both first  rate .  br    br   sadly  john ritter died during the series  and it put a damper on things . they had to scramble to change the show and bring in more cast members  and it was obviously an uncomfortable situation  but they handled it well . james garner was a good addition . it could have lasted longer had ritter lived .  br    br   i especially loved it when they brought in ed o  neill in a guest spot . that was great .  br    br    out of   ,1

this stalk and slash turkey manages to bring nothing new to an increasingly stale genre . a masked killer stalks young  pert girls and slaughters them in a variety of gruesome ways  none of which are particularly inventive .  br    br   it  s not scary  it  s not clever  and it  s not funny . so what was the point of it   ,0
can only be described as awful . it is bad to start with and then gets even more bad . when you start you really have to watch it through because it is impossible to believe that it can get worse  but fear not because it does . another poorly written script for a donkey director for no  talent offspring of past movie stars . it  s hard to decide if the script is worse than the acting or whether the directing is worse than both . as for the hero  well he belts up everyone including one scene where he beats the living daylights out of the tough by swinging open the wardrobe door and smashing him against the window with it . and in another scene he gets thrown through a window and crashes   ft onto concrete  doesn  t even blink  then gets up immediately and gets stuck into the baddies . this is a really ridiculous movie . lucky it only cost me   to hire .  ,0
as others have pointed out this movie is a load of pretentious drivel for the mindless or masochists .  br    br   we all know after seeing trainspotting and acid house that scotland is one of the most depressing places in the first world . but unlike trainspotting and acid house without a good dose of humour or gritty realism movies like this do not work . and even more importantly without a decent script a movie will not work and there is nothing new  inspiring or thought provoking about the script for this movie .  br    br   the fact that this movie won a couple of bafta  s shows how bad the british film industry is at the moment . i thought the aussie movie industry was pretty bad at the moment but unfortunately the british industry is even worse .  br    br   this movie is so bad i wouldn  t even bother renting it from the weeklies section .  br    br   do yourself a favour and give this movie a wide berth .  ,0
a female executioner  played by the sexy jennifer thomas ii  has the fun job of fulfilling all the fantasies of all the men on death row before they meet their maker . and what a way to go . lucky this film is not real  or we would have a lot more people in this world on death row .  br    br   it starts out real slow . low light and bad acting  like most  b  films . it gets better as it moves along . and ends with a bang .  br    br   i would rate it very high on the low cost  very sexy movies of the    s . it  s a must see once the kids are away or in bed .  ,1
there are many different versions of this one floating around  so make sure you can locate one of the unrated copies  otherwise some gore and one scene of nudity might be missing . some versions also omit most of the opening sequence and other bits here and there . the cut i saw has the on  screen title witchcraft evil encounters and was released by shriek show  who maintain the original us release title witchery for the dvd release . it  s a nice  looking print and seems to have all of the footage  but has some cropping  aspect ratio issues . in italy  it was released as la casa   witchcraft  . the first two la casa releases were actually the first two evil dead films  retitled  and the third la casa was another film by the same production company  filmirage   which is best known here in america as ghosthouse . to make matters even more confusing  witchery was also released elsewhere as ghosthouse  . except in germany  where ghosthouse  is actually the ogre demons  . ok  i better just shut up now . i  m starting to confuse myself   br    br   regardless of the title  this is a very hit  or  miss horror effort . some of it is good  some of it isn  t . i actually was into this film for the first half or so  but toward the end it became a senseless mess . a large  vacant hotel located on an island about   miles from boston is the setting  as various people get picked off one  by  one by a german  speaking witch  hildegard knef  . photographer gary  david hasselhoff   who wants to capture  witch light   and his virginal writer girlfriend  leslie cumming   who is studying witchcraft  are shacking up at the hotel without permission . along comes real estate agent jerry  rick farnsworth   who  s showing off the property to potential buyers rose  annie ross  and freddie  robert champagne  brooks . also tagging along are their children pregnant grown daughter jane  linda blair  and very young son tommy  michael manchester   as well as oversexed architect linda sullivan  catherine hickland  hasselhoff  s wife at the time  . once everyone is inside  their boat driver is killed  hung  and the boat disappears  so they find themselves trapped and basically at the mercy of the  lady in black .   br    br   so what can you expect to find here  plenty of unpleasantries  one of the characters has their lips sewn shut and is then hung upside down in the fireplace and accidentally slow  roasted by the rest of the cast . there  s also a crucifixion  witches eating a dead baby  a swordfish through the head  someone set on fire  a possession  a sesame street tape recorder  the virgin getting raped by some demon  a guys veins bulging and exploding thanks to voodoo doll pokes and some other stuff . from a technical standpoint  it  s a nice  looking film with pretty good cinematography  a decent score and good gore effects . the hotel  island setting is also pretty nice . blair  particularly at the end  and ross both seem like they  re having fun and knef is great as the evil witch . even though people like to ridicule hasselhoff these days  he  s not bad in his role  either .  br    br   on the down side  despite all the gore  the film seems somewhat dull and it gets monotonous after about an hour . the supernatural themes are muddled and confusing  too . when characters are being swept into the witches lair to be tortured and killed  the filmmakers unwisely decided to superimpose the screaming actors over some silly looking red spiral vortex effect that looks supremely cheesy . and the witch lair itself is vacant and cheaply designed with unfinished lumber . and while most of the cast is at least decent  a few of the performances  particularly the  actress  who plays hasselhoff  s girlfriend and the kid  are so bad they  re constantly distracting .  ,0
i was in the film too  but i don  t know if they actually put this scene in . on the way back from a school trip  in      we stopped at a service station at the same time as they were doing the film  and we were asked  the whole of us  to run in and shout go  freebird  we were all around   years old  could anyone who has seen the film tell me if that part was actually kept in the film  it would be great to know  i remember i thought the film had never come out  because it was another  and a half years before it was released . all of your comments seem to be good so i  m guessing it has been quite a successful film  i might buy it  but first i would like to know if i  m in it  d thank you  ,1
as far as i know  this show was never repeated on uk television after its original run in the late    s  early    s  and most episodes are now sadly  missing presumed wiped  .  br    br   series  from     however still exists in its entirety  and i recently got the chance to watch it all  the best part of  decades on .  br    br   after rushing home from school  freewheelers was essential viewing for me and many of my contemporaries back in those halcyon days of flared trousers  slade and chicory tip . and watching it again brought a nostalgic lump to the throat .  br    br   never mind the bad  hammy acting  the unintentionally amusing fight scenes  plot holes wide enough to pilot a large ocean  going yacht through and the  frightfully  frightfully  rada accents of the lead players .  br    br   no  forget all that . because freewheelers harks back to a bygone  dare i say  golden   age of kids  tv drama  when the shows were simply about rip  roaring fun and didn  t take themselves so seriously . before they became obsessed with all the angst  laden  ishoos  that today  s screenwriters have their young protagonists fret over  such as relationships  pregnancy  drugs  stis etc .  br    br   no doubt if it were  remade for a modern audience  in these days of all  pervasive political correctness  the boss figure would be a black female  one of the young male heroes would be a muslim  the other would be a white lad confused about his sexuality and the girl would be an all  action go  getter with an iq off the scale  who  d be forever getting the lads out of scrapes and making them look foolish  in other words a million miles removed from wendy padbury  s deferential  ankle  spraining washer  upper .  br    br   it  s a show that  s very much  of its time  . but is that a bad thing  i for one don  t think so .  ,1
this is a script that ed wood worked over   years on trying to get made . aris iliopulos finally got the chutzpah to film a script that wood saved from his burning home at the expense of other  more transitory valuables .  br    br   this is a dialogue  free movie  that some may foolishly describe as silent . in fact  it is a quite noisy film  without the inane chatter of most flicks . in the hands of these filmmakers  the music and sound effects provide a rich audio experience that works better than almost any grist from the hollywood script mill  particularly that stupid boat movie billy zane last was in   watch out     oh no    j . cameron . . . . ick . . .  i  ll take zane  s wonderfully communicative monosyllabic grunts in this film over empty dialogue any day .  br    br   billy zane heads a team of players who obviously really wanted to be in this film . ricci is radiant as always  and the gods are shining when you can put sandra bernhard  rick  y  schroeder  eartha kitt and andrew mccarthy  s name on the same poster .  br    br   the design is perfect  the pyramid set exquisite  and ron perlman  s beastly performance is simply wonderful . overall  this is a chaotic  visceral masterpiece lovingly crafted by fans of ed wood jr .  auteur and cinenephile . a must see for anyone who really loves movies the way that the first rate iliopulos and his cast obviously do . a film to make you wish you had made it yourself .  ,1
i  m sorry but this is just awful . i have told people about this film and some of the bad acting that is in it and they almost don  t believe me . there is nothing wrong with the idea  modern day japanese troops get pulled back in time to the days of busido warriors and with their modern weapons are a match for almost everything . when the troops first realise something strange is happening does every single person in the back of the transport need to say  hey my watch has stopped   imagine lines like that being repeated    times before they say anything else and you have the movie  s lack of greatness in a nutshell .  ,0
i think the majority of the people seem not the get the right idea about the movie  at least that  s my opinion . i am not sure it  s a movie about drug abuse rather it  s a movie about the way of thinking of those genius brothers  drugs are side effects  something marginal . again  it  s not a commercial movie that you see every day and if the author wanted that  he definitely failed  as most people think it  s one of the many drug related movies . i  however  think something else is the case . as in many movies portraying different cultures  audience usually fully understands movies portraying their own culture  i . e . something they  ve grown up with and are quite familiar with . this movie is to show what those  genius  people very often think and what problems they face . the reason why they act like this is because they are bored out of their minds   they have to meet people who do mediocre things and accept those things as if they are launching space shuttles on daily basis . they start a fairly hard job and excel in no time . they feel like  i went to work  did nothing  still did twice as better as the guys around me when they were all over their projects  what should i do now with my free time . and what  s even more boring  when you can start predicting behavior not because you  re psychologist  but instead because you have seen this pattern in the past . so  for them  from one side it  s a non challenging job  which is also fairly boring sometimes  and from another they start to figure out people  s behavior . it  s a recipe for big big boredom . and the dumbest things are usually done to get out of this state . they guy earlier who mentioned that their biggest problem is that they are trying to figure out life in terms of logic  math describes logic   while life is not really a logical thing  is actually absolutely right .  ,1
nobody could like this movie for its merit but  if you have a sense of humor and enjoy schlock movies for their mst  quality  then this is for you . it ranks up there with  road house  for its preposterous characters  sets and story line . the bad writing really cracked me up  i want you to dust those guys off  instead of  . . . dust those guys .  f    s take off from the carrier but  when they get into formation  they  re f    s  without a hint of anger or skepticism  segal goes back to work for the general who  only minutes before  was overseeing a covert  mind wipe  on seagal . segal runs out of bullets and resorts to a knife to kill the guards . so naturally  the guards all drop their guns and fight with knives too  the hand grenade is a dud but explodes anyway . the little stealth fighter can fly all the way from california to afganistan without refueling . then segal flies it back to california  the long way  i . e .  by way of europe  even though there  s a carrier giving him air support   minutes away in the arabian sea . the cic in the carrier consists of  black pcs   flat screen tvs and pictures of gauges and maps on the walls . what a hoot   ,0
it is very unfortunate when a movie such as this is made . a great deal of work and money has been put into a film that is amateur at best .  br    br   the editing drags on  there are obvious mistakes that could have been corrected easily in a second take  and the soundtrack is unimaginative . so much more could have been done with this video movie . i guess they ran out of time  or videotape .  br    br   hand  held shots have a distinct amateur feel to them .  ,0
robert forster  normally a very strong character actor  is lost at sea here cast as a new york family man seeking revenge on the thugs who murdered his son and attacked his wife in a home invasion . scary subject matter exploited for cheapjack thrills in the  death wish  vein . it isn  t difficult to scoff at these smarmy proceedings the dialogue is full of howlers  the crime statistics are irrevocably dated  and the supporting characters are ridiculously over  written  particularly a despicable judge who allows an accused murderer to walk right out of the courtroom  . low  rent production is contemptible in its self  righteousness  especially as the violence in our cities has only increased .  from   ,0
wow . that  s about as much as i can say right now . who writes this stuff  who produces this stuff  what self  respecting actor would agree to  act  in this stuff  oh my god  i don  t know how i made it through this movie  but i assume the fact that i had had like  cups of coffee that day was the key element in keeping me awake . good lord  it was one of the most droned  out and predictable pieces of cinematography i have ever witnessed . . . and for the record  i don  t ever plan to  witness  it again .  br    br   i first saw the film when i bought the dvd  mistake    . i mean . . . i figured  hey  julia stiles . i like her . she  s cool . i  ll watch it as soon as i get home  mistake    . i tried to watch it without groaning every five minutes wondering when this bunch of crap would come to an end  really i did . but i was unsuccessful . it was one of the worst things i had ever seen . i mean . . . what is with that thing where he imagines what would happen then snaps back into real life  that was annoying enough when the father used to do that in  parenthood  like ten years ago . the  jokes   and believe me  it takes a lot out of me to call them that  are stupid  the characters are trite and forgettable  the storyline is entirely predictable . . . altogether this makes for a movie that should be wiped from history records  i should have figured something was wrong when i realized that i  d never heard of this movie . it was most likely a straight  to  dvd .  br    br   to anybody who may be thinking of watching this  i have one piece of advice . don  t  for the love of god . . . don  t    i  m ashamed to have it in my dvd collection  and i can  t get rid of it . . . nobody  and i mean nobody wants to buy it from me  and i  m talking second  hand and third  hand thrift shops that would buy the mud off your shoes and stick it in the store window . that should let you know just how crap it is .  ,0
strange enough  all the previous comments merely described the beginning and left the details over . i feel a necessity to confirm that this is a family work  since marina vlady was also robert hossein  s wife  and the  excellent  jazz music was written by te director  s father  andr . under these circumstances  no wonder it was a really good thriller  seen when issued and immediately identified with the music . the suspense was flawless  and maintained throughout until the end . robert hossein  at the time one of the best european players  managed to impose himself also as a top screen and stage director . he  s still putting up great stage shows  with a preference for religious subjects . harry carasso  paris  france  ,1
man  some of you people have got to chill . this movie was artistic genius . instead of searching for reasoning or messages to justify it in your reality  why can  t you understand that it is a work of fiction  a story . entertainment  for god  s sake  no pun intended  . it seems to me that too many of the people on here are trying to be movie critics   and they  re not doing to well . i  m so impressed by the movie and bill paxton  s job at directing  that i  m going to contact him personally to tell him . ya know  if you weren  t trying to analyze the heck out of the possibility of the story line  you might just enjoy the film . me and all of my friends did   ,1
first of all  if you  r a fan of the comic  well  you  ll be very disappointed i  m sure  low budget movie    largo is supposed to be serbian in the comic  now suddenly he becomes croatian  pfff  chicken producers  it gave some spice and guts to the comic  by the way  in the film  his father speaks serbian and he speaks croatian . . . lol  . the striking n . y . winch building becomes a common average  small yacht in h . k . the good looking largo becomes some unshaved tzigan  turkish looking guy . freddy the cool  scarface  pilot becomes some fat  out of shape  sad  average guy . simon  largo  s good buddy  does not exist at all   he gave some pepper  largo doesn  t throw knifes at all  but just some snake stares . . . the whole story is confused and looks like a pretentious tv  film . french directors and producers  if you don  t have the money  the ability or the technology to adapt correctly the comic  please stick to some romance shooted in paris . very very bad film  good thing i just rented it  don  t count on me to watch the sequel  if there is any   .  ,0
more directors like nacho vigalondo need a greater outlet for their talents .     de la maana is absolute genius . what nacho is able to convey in  minutes takes some hollywood directors hours of film to achieve . i watched this smiling  but feeling a little dirty and not in the sexual way . you sit and wonder how you should feel after watching this  min . nugget . i was entertained  but was disturbed at the same time . not many people can do that in just  minutes . it starts off simple enough . a young women comes in for breakfast at her usual place . she sits down and someone starts singing . from there  the film takes you through so many different emotions all at once it is hard to describe . it is in black  white  but this helps with the feeling the film gives you . this film makes you want to know more about the characters  how they interacted previously and how the ending impacted their lives afterward . i guess it like the old saying   leave them wanting more   nacho vigalondo is able to do that . watch this when you can . show it to your friends and wonder how  minutes can be so much fun without taking off your clothes .  ,1
i don  t think most people give this movie as much credit as it deserves . i love low budget horror movies and this takes the cake  especially for originality . yes the scarecrow is a kung  fu fighting frightner  but why not  no one else is willing to go that far . i really haven  t had this much fun watching a movie since candyman . so the town picks on this one kid calling him scarecrow  even his mom doesn  t care about him . then he gets killed and the spirit is infused with in the scarecrow  who then goes on a killing spree . his demise is relatively easy to assume once the movie gets going . the dedications at the end go straight to a bunch of horror directors  but with most dedication towards dario argento really struck me as cool  these folks who wanna make movies of a newer genre . over the movie has a lot of arnold rip offs  with one liners you  ll definitely laugh at like stick around and he kills the sheriff with a stick . i would say  grab a pizza some friends an laugh your a off with this movie . i love it for its originality  most fun .  ,1
i can hardly believe i watched this again last night after more than   years . . .  br    br   some time back  i watched  fu films in a row . . . boris karloff  and all  chris lees . the last  lees  both directed  and i use that word loosely  by jess franco  were abominable . at the time  i skipped this one  remembering that  in some ways  it was even worse .  br    br   well  i watched it . never again . you know what  s worse that an abominable film  a really well  made piece of s . and that  s what fiendish plot is . it is a very good  looking movie . great production design  sets  costumes  music  photography  editing  mostly good cast  some decent acting . . .  br    br   . . . and absolutely  positively  one of the worst scripts in movie history      aaaugh      the first minute of the film is so deceptive . . . one might mistake this for a decent movie . and then they start singing  happy birthday to fu  . . . and it goes downhill . having burt kwouk  of whom his master says   your face   is familiar .   accidentally pour out fu  s elixir vitae to put out a fire  resulting in his being condemned to torture  burial and having one of his ears cut off  was the closest thing to funny they had . it was like someone decided they wanted to do a  campy  film   so ridiculous it would be funny . ridiculous  it is . . . funny . . . it ain  t . at all .  br    br   it  s sad  because it  s clear in the first few minutes that someone did a lot of research into the fu manchu series in order to get so much of it  right  . with a different script   either a really funny one  or a dead serious one  they might have   could have   should have   had a classic on their hands . a film that could have made one forget the horror of those jess franco atrocities . . . instead of making one want to dig them out as masterpieces  by comparison .  br    br   there was a period in the late    s when a whole slew of classic    s characters were revived in movies that were universally awful . buck rogers  flash gordon  tarzan  the lone ranger  charlie chan  even doc savage . i  m not sure  this one may be the worst of the lot . it took great self  control not to fast  forward over whole sections of it  especially any scenes containing sid caesar  fbi chief who was also al capone  s cousin   you see what i mean   . it isn  t just that the ideas in the film aren  t funny . . . they often make no sense whatsoever . like when they  audition  police officers to impersonate the king and queen  and we wind up seeing people  audition  dance  hall routines like singing  dancing  and riding a unicycle . how many drugs did the writers of this thing have to take for any of this to make sense to them   br    br   as i said  a shame . . . and a real waste of all that talent  including that of peter sellers  who played both fu and nayland smith   burt kwouk  who  d been in a chris lee fu film in his time   helen mirren  the police woman who shockingly falls in love with the villain and damn near steals the last half  hour of the film   . i begin to wonder if anyone will ever make a  proper  fu manchu film  or if fans will have to settle for karloff  s being almost the only one   ,0
if you love the thin man series  you will love this movie . powell  s character of vance is very similar to his character of nick charles . there are even dogs . . .  br    br   the chemistry between powell and astor may not be as fabulous as powell and loy  but it isn  t half bad .  ,1
this is just one more of those hideous films that you find on lifetime tv which portray the abhorrent behavior of some disgusting woman in an empathetic manner . along with other such nasty films as  the burning bed    enough   or  monster   this film takes a disgusting criminal and attempts to show the viewer why she  s not such a bad person after all . give us a break  here  s my question to the filmmakers if letourneau were a man  and vili were a   year old girl  would you have made a picture sympathizing and empathizing with this person  answer hell no .  br    br   imagine switching the genders in this film  and then you  ll see just why myself and others here consider this a worthless piece of garbage . were the genders switched  there would be no attempt to empathize with the criminal . instead  we  d likely be treated to a portrayal of a monstrous and hideous man preying upon a young girl  his lascivious behavior landing him in prison  and his brainwashed victim suffering from stockholm syndrome . the only reason letourneau does not receive the same treatment in this film is by virtue of her sex .  br    br   let  s call a spade a spade . letourneau is a pedophile . plain and simple . no ifs  ands or buts . she  s a criminal who belongs in prison  and deserves our derision and contempt  but certainly not our pity or empathy .  ,0
the first time i saw this episode was like a shock to me  it was actually the first time i saw     . the speed things are happening is amazing  and it  s so surprising  thrilling  and even interesting  it  s almost as if you are reading a book once you start it  it  s very hard to stop . from the minute richard walsh was talking privately to jack about the possibility that they have a mole inside ctu  i was sitting     hours  which means   episodes     sounds funny and crazy  but i  m the kind of guy which when he is interested he just can  t stop  this series is one of the best of it  s kind . and it  s build in a way of having a few different stories that are being connected together . recommended in every way   ,1
oh it really really is . i  ve seen films that i disliked more  due to whatever reason  but never have i seen a film that just fails in every single aspect of film making . it even fails to fail at film making  in a way the hercules in new york could be said to do . it  s not the film i like the least  but it is the very worst film i  ve ever seen .  br    br   the acting is the first thing that strikes you . i  ve never seen a worse acted film outside of pornography . in fact i  ve plenty of pornographic films that are acted a damn site better than this . it really is awful .  br    br   technically  it  s terrible . the camera  work is amateurish . the editing is nonsensical . i presume they couldn  t afford proper sound equipment  and this meant that every scene in a car  and there  s a lot of them  has them driving at about three miles per hour and every scene set outside by the same patch of woods  and there  s a lot of them too  is actually dubbed from a studio  again lending more to the bad porn vibe .  br    br   the plot is nonsensical  as many have pointed out . i  ll defend vampires walking in daylight by the fact that despite it being popularized by nosferatu  this was never originally an intrinsic part of the vampire mythos .  br    br   speaking of vampire mythos  the writer had evidently read carmilla  or at very least seen the vampire lovers . i  m not sure how i feel about this  swaying from impressed that a movie this dire has at least some aspirations to a gothic novel i  m very fond of or annoyed by its at best sledgehammer references and at worst total desecration of source material . at very least  the general  is an insult to peter cushing though .  br    br   it gets two stars however  merely because i can  t bring myself to vote one star for a film that has  or at least purports to have  both vampires and zombies in it . incidentally i watched lifeforce  another film that tenuously has vampires and zombies in it  on the same day as this  and despite being a rather flawed film itself  really comes out a masterpiece compared to this .  br    br   so in the end  this is not a film so bad it  s good  or so bad it  s in any way enjoyable  even drunk . it  s just a mess  and worth no  one  s time watching .  ,0
seven young people go to the forest looking for a bear . soon they are all stalked and viciously murdered by a crazy vietnam veteran .  trampa infernal  is a pretty entertaining mexican slasher that reminds me a lot  the zero boys  . the film is fast  paced and there are some good death scenes like throat slashing or axe in the neck . unfortunately there is not much gore  so fans of grand  guignol will be disappointed . however if you are a fan of slasher movies give this rarity a look . mexican horror flicks are quite obscure  i have seen only  alucarda  and  don  t panic    so this should be another reason to see this enjoyable slasher . my rating  out of   . highly recommended .  ,1
a young scientist is trying to carry on his dead father  s work on limb regeneration . his overbearing mother has convinced him that he murdered his own father and is monitoring his progress for her own evil purposes . a young doctor uses reptilian dna he extracts from a large creature and when his arm is conveniently ripped off a few minutes later  he injects himself with his formula and grows a new murderous arm . . . admittedly the special effects in  severed ties  are pretty good and grotesque  but the rest of the film is awful . the severed arm is behaving like a snake and kills few people . big deal . the acting is mediocre and the climax is silly .  out of   .  ,0
an old saying goes  if you think you have problems  visit a hospital .  that has been updated in recent years to  if you think you have problems  watch a tv talk show . . . especially jerry springer  s   this movie is one of those that is so bad  it  s good  that  s why i gave it a seven  it  s all right  but not great . it  s a great way to waste   minutes  just as the daily talk show is advertised as  an hour of your life you  ll never get back   all the familiar themes are here . . . unfaithful husbands  boyfriends  the wildest audience on television  women flashing jerry  etc . the shocker was watching molly hagan  who normally plays sweet characters   seinfeld  and  herman  s head   playing a trailer  trash mom and jaime pressly   my name is earl   as her equally trashy daughter  performing sexual favors for virtually every man with whom they came in contact . the men  including the staff producer  were presented as quintessential lunkheads who deserved what they got . i don  t want to spoil or reveal everything but the movie plays like the daily show . here in phoenix  it  s shown back  to  back for two hours every morning and  after that  everything else seems to pale . again  i give this movie a seven . . . it  s good but not great . jerry springer is best taken in small one hour doses .  ,1
viewing de vierde man  aka the fourth man  is a slightly unsettling and rather fascinating experience . it  s a very tight and intense psychological mystery  thriller from netherlands  s paul verhoeven . he directed this film just before he got big with his  free  ticket to hollywood   movie flesh  blood . in a lot of user  comments on this site i noticed the mentioning of alfred hitchcock . indeed  this movie might very well be hitchcockian  but i also noticed touches of early cronenberg  the visceral   flavors of david lynch  surreal story  linked visuals  and even roman polanski  plot  wise set  up  . funny thing is that the movies by those directors i was thinking of while watching de vierde man weren  t made until after      the year of release of the fourth man . so go figure .  br    br   very much credit indeed must be given to the story of the original novel by gerard reve this movie is based on . gerard reve is also the fictional name of the main character  a tormented writer  played by jeroen krabb  balancing on the dangerous line of a severe psychosis  . now  has anybody stopped and thought about the fact that the word  rve  is french for  dream   and the film does feature a lot of dream  like  nightmarish sequences  often to that extend that you don  t always know for sure if gerard is awake or dreaming himself . could this be coincidence . . .  maybe it  s just me  but i don  t think so . rene soutendijk is pretty amazing as the leading lady  in a rather demanding role  . she sometimes seems to be guilty of over  acting  in a subtle way  . but that aspect was clearly intentional to portray the character she plays  since as this movie progresses  you become unsure about what to actually think of this lady and her intentions . proves again what an excellent actress she is . i might add that the movie contains also several scenes portraying full frontal male  female nudity  as well as some rather explicit sex  scenes  and you will even notice that some scenes and aspects clearly were the blueprints of scenes later to be shot for verhoeven  s basic instinct  .  br    br   another aspect this movie has is a lot of symbolism and biblical references  images  which supposedly made the film thoroughly hated by some conservative  catholic movements at the time of its european release . either way  it makes the movie worthy of a second viewing . now  someone recently told me he had grave misgivings about de vierde man . one of them being that the film supposedly manoeuvers itself into a position where it needs the divine intervention of the virgin mary to resolve itself . i myself have big issues with the way catholicism has been  and still is sometimes  portrayed in many movies in any genre  so not only when it comes to religiously themed horror movies  . but surprisingly  i had no misgivings whatsoever when it comes to the fourth man . although the virgin mary  aspect in the plot did make me scratch my head at one point  i also had fun with it  in a way . i think the keyword as to why it didn  t bother me at all is  duality  . because  this movie works on two levels . although  divine intervention  might have resolved the plot  line from the protagonist  s point of view . . . on the other hand the movie implies that all this might have been the delirious ramblings of a raving madman . and that  s the fun part you never know for sure . and then there  s the question could it be that gerard reve was somehow receiving distorted visions of things to come . . . like receiving omens  at one point in the movie  gerard even tries to fool christine into believing he is clairvoyant . the way he is playing christine in that particular scene is exquisite to behold .  br    br   so with its compelling story  convincing acting performances and adequate direction  de vierde man is a very much recommended viewing indeed  especially if you enjoy a solid european psychological horror film  . but make sure you see the original dutch version  not the dubbed one  .  ,1

watching this again recently  i found it heartwarming to see the way they sincerely tried to bring the book to the screen  even if the shoestring budget and hammy actors meant inevitable failure . by any objective measure this was a disaster  but i found it easy to imagination how good a lord of the rings movie could be if someone was to make one sincerely  and with the money to employ the most talented artists and script writers . unfortunately  thanks to jackson  that will not be possible for a long time .  br    br   watching this movie left me with the impression that with any sort of budget at all  then this story simply couldn  t be stuffed up . fantasy just provides so many opportunities for making an interesting film . there were many moments in this film that were potentially more interesting than the way that peter jackson did it  although of course you always have to use your imagination due to the poor execution . the way they tried to show the wraith world from frodo  s point of view for example . or the way that galadriel showed sam what was happening back home for another .  br    br   another thing i really appreciated in this version  the silent moments . there were moments when dialog was spoken with no background music against a still back  drop . compare that to the grandiose swooping camera of the jackson films  and the intrusive score which seemed designed to stress how each and every scene was the most poignant and powerful scene we had ever watched . jackson  s films were full of their own importance  this was quieter and a lot more modest .  br    br   jackson and co hit this with more than us    million dollars in production costs  at least    million dollars more for marketing  a massive tax break from the nz government  and also gained massive savings from filming in nz not the usa . however  despite the marketing claims  the intention to be faithful was never there . this is well documented . philippa boyens said as much in an interview  when she said they deliberately didn  t re  read the books before writing the script . jackson also stated that they originally intended to make a fantasy film  along the lines of  the lord of the rings  and that the one he really wanted to do was return of the king  because it had a lot of battles but no character development .  br    br   in contrast  this film tried to be more true . of course a lot of things were wrong  the acting was awful and pretty much sunk everything  and the pace was too fast . naturally they cut a lot  and adapted other scenes  and for this they deserve credit . while jackson added a lot of action scenes that served no plot purpose  bakshi cut book scenes which did nothing to advance the plot anyway . there  s actually a curious similarity between the structure of the jackson and bakshi films near the beginning  in that they both deviate from the original books in the same way  although of course some of this could be coincidence .  br    br   this was not a good film  but the potential was there . bakshi said in an interview to the onion av club that only animation could do the lord of the rings justice . his version didn  t work  but he might have been right .  ,0
i don  t get this . the movie obviously has a pretty good budget . it has very good cinematography . it has nice pacing  good editing and pretty good directing too . then why oh why didn  t they hire someone to do a final rewrite of the script so it would not be so damn cheesy and why oh why did they hire such lousy actors that can  t act their way out of a paper bag  this movie could have been good . at most times it looks good and feels good but in the end  you realize that the movie was no good at all .  br    br   so i would say it  s a good production but a bad movie . too bad actually .  br    br   and eels  come one  really   ,0
cassavetes was clearly an intelligent  sensitive man with bold new ideas about making films . he wanted to be an auteur  to break away from the confines of the system and bring a new realism to the american cinema . for that  i applaud him .  br    br   unfortunately  as a member of his audience  i cannot applaud a woman under the influence . cassavetes took what could have been a fascinating topic  an insane woman  and somehow managed to craft a dull film  filled with lengthy  ad  libbed ranting and drawn  out scenes . he seems to have had a gift for capturing the dullest moments of a person  s life on film  and it often appears as though he simply turned the camera on his family and let the motor run and run . this tactic would be acceptable if cassavetes had captured something devastatingly real   or even a kernel of something so real it touched the heart in ways a conventional film could not . yet i found the performances  particularly rowlands   to be artificial . i never believed for a moment that she was really insane . i have met people who are truly mentally disturbed  yet i  ve never seen any of them act quite like gena rowlands in a woman under the influence . she played it like a very obnoxious  uninhibited woman who drinks a lot  and even that was confusing because we only see her drink once  at the beginning   but she acts drunk for the remainder of the film . there are some moments in which she taps into something real  but those moments are few and far between she fails to sustain a seamless mentally disturbed character . again  i applaud her efforts  but effort alone is not enough to make the performance ring true .  br    br   novice audiences who happen upon this film and see its high imdb rating will no doubt feel compelled to love it and rate it highly  just to prove that they  get it .  but don  t be brainwashed by the hype   judge for yourself . you don  t have to pretend to like it .  br    br   like woody allen  john cassavetes could be accused of solipsism in his film  making  seeming to find his own psyche and his own life experiences so endlessly fascinating that he couldn  t imagine that to others they appeared presumptive and tortuously self  indulgent . but woody allen at least has demonstrated a gift for keeping an audience entertained   he knows that a compelling story structure and a good dose of humor are essential to any movie . if cassavetes had employed some self  discipline  and a sharp pair of editing shears    a woman under the influence could have stood a chance . but what  s the point of making a  realistic  film if the only people who can stand to sit through it are the art  house devotees and film students who worship cassavetes as some sort of anti  establishment deity  without dumbing anything down  i believe cassavetes could have made a woman slightly more accessible by keeping the pace moving with an actual plot  instead of presenting a string of   minute  long scenes of ad  libbed arguments . if you just make films for yourself and a few of your fans  you  re just reaching the already converted . watch this movie with your own set of eyes and make your own decisions about it . if you are truly moved and fascinated by it  good for you .  ,0
as a horse lover one can only appreciate this movie . there are few movies that show horsemanship as this one does . i would love to know if brian does his own riding in the film . would also like to know if he enjoys horses . brian has been in a lot of movies where he has ridden . where did he learn to ride  the only part that is hard for me to take is that the riding scenes are always full tilt  like a horse can run forever at full steam . the camera  work is first rate and captures the horses in a way that shows how dangerous things can be on top of a horse . it would be very interesting to know how they went about casting this movie to find all of the very good horseback riders .  ,1
this movie has a few things going for it right off the bat . having dani filth as a lead actor is automatically going to make some people like this movie . admittedly  i love cradle of filth and listened to the soundtrack to this movie long before i watched it . dani filth is a very recognizable character and makes for a great lead . the independent filming style of the movie is great for the creepy factor . there are some gorgeous actresses in this movie . for being low budget  the special effects weren  t bad either . the ways that people died were very creative and nightmarish .  br    br   now on to the cons . there is very little talking throughout this whole movie  thus making for very little as far as character development . it  s hard to fear for the lives of limp  static characters . when there was a little talking  the f bomb was abundant  popping up in random places . yes  i understand people swear but it seems like a preteen boy scripted this and thought himself cool for including all the language . the storyline  what i could make out of it  was pretty good although many parts are left dangling and the lack of conversation leaves one often wondering what  s happening .  br    br   in the end  cradle of fear is like a porno for people who love sex and violence  but like a porno trying to pull of a storyline  it just doesn  t work too well . rent it though  if you  re a morbid person looking to sate your blood and flesh appetite .  ,0
this is one of my favorite family movies . loved it when i was little and it still holds up with me now that i  m older . i still laugh at all the same old jokes and might even shed a tear a times . i never have much cared for animals talking  or at least un  animated ones but this one i  ll stand up for . it  s a pretty old movie but it will always hold a place in my heart .  br    br   there aren  t any other live animal movies that i can think of at the moment that i even could compare with  let alone like as much as this one . i might be giving too much praise to this movie but i don  t think show . i really holds that great message that  home is where the heart is .  or at least that  s the message i gained from it . definitely recommended for a good old family movie night .  ,1
a lot of people hated this movie  but that i blame on two facts    they want it to be too much like the first couple of american pie movies . and   they are trying to take it too seriously .  br    br   this one i found was the best one out of all six  and i absolutely love dwight . the plot is predictable  i  ll say that  but then what teen comedy isn  t  road trip  dirty deeds etc etc  they are all incredibly predictable  but still goddamn funny  i say this is worth watching  i love it  i find it hilarious . just don  t watch it while comparing it to the first ones because it  s nothing alike .  br    br   after watching naked mile and this one  it became obvious that all the american pie movies were about  and only about  the stiflers . which is fine by me .  br    br   watch . enjoy . love . xd  ,1
what more could anyone want  he  s a history lesson  foreign language tutor  nra representative and ambassador to burundi dressed in a nice silk frock and heels . i laughed so hard i left a puddle . his woes about puberty  transvestism  public school  and done in several languages made the absolute finest stand  up routine i have ever seen . i think about it now  years later when i see cake  tea and cake or death  and hear something translated into french  the mouse is under the table  the cat is on the chair and the monkey is on the branch . i like his versions of what jerry dorsey could have been named before he settled on englebert humperdinck . i really hope to see a lot more from this wonderful guy . he has a lot to teach us  and a wonderful way of telling it . thanks for your time .  ,1
welcome to a bad ghost story and someone  s nightmare . this horror tale finds a newly married husband  john hudson  and wife  peggy weber  haunted by the memory of his previous wife and screaming skulls found throughout their empty mansion and lily pond . is the husband really trying to drive his already anxious bride insane  or is it the learning challenged gardener mickey  alex nicol  who has taken care of the mansion  s grounds since the death of the original mistress of the house  this low budget horror flick has a story line that keeps you involved all the way the finale . special effects are pretty bad even at     standards . i swear at times the screaming skull sounds much like it should be in a godzilla movie . also in the cast as reverend snow is character actor russ conway . by the way . . . the lurking gardener  nicol  is the film  s director . you can catch this as part of amc  s monsterfest .  ,0
that  s not the sound of bees  that  s the effect induced by watching this extremely long  extremely boring  badly acted movie . how i ever made it through all     hours without falling asleep i  ll never know . the plot is simple . . .  thoroughly unlikable morons talk about sex for     hours . and you thought rohmer was deadly . this is even worse  if that  s possible .  i must really be a masochist if i could watch this entire movie without turning it off . . . or killing someone .  ,0
i loved this flick when it came out in the    s and still do  i still quote classic lines like  say it again  and  you said you  d rip my balls off sir  . ron leibman was hot and very funny  although it was underrated and disowned by mad  i have to say that this little gem will always be a treasure of mine and a movie that i would take with me if sent to a deserted island  i only wish that someone would release the dvd because my vhs tape is about worn out  if you like cheesed out comedy  this is definitely for you and should be considered a cult classic  it is military humor at it  s best and worse  rent it if you can  t own it   ,1
ok so after watching this invigorating movie and wasting an hour and so many minutes off my life here is the basic summary genie comes out of ghetto boom box  gives this kid with shaggy hair  wishes  the kid wastes his wishes on i forget what  shaq sucks at rapping  and i guess thats it .  br    br   so mainly i laughed  i cried . . . . . . but mainly i laughed at the shear comedy that came from the wonderful acting skills of an nba player  rapper and boy with shaggy hair .  br    br   i highly recommend this movie for college kids sitting around drinking some beers with their close friends and are in serious need of a good laugh .  br    br   i  m going to give it a  out of   only b  c the movie is based off of  magical wishes .  br    br   if i had  wishes one would be to erase this horrible movie and for everyone to pretend like hollywood didn  t waste money on making this .  ,0
 . . . for the lt to have chosen this one . first  the film wasn  t horrible  it was just hollywood . worst case i  need  this  to  happen  or  we  have  no  movie scenario if willis  mission was to save the doctor  but she was adamant that her  people  make it out of the missionary  he would have put her on that first chopper and marched those refugees to the border without her . he would not have compromised his package for the refugees . that  s not how it works . but  as i pointed out  this is hollywood  we must have drama . this is why we make movies  because reality isn  t quite so complicated . however  i did think that willis and the good doctor had workable chemistry . that said  there are also some well done battle scenes in the film . it  s not a waste of time   tears of the sun  is worth the dvd rental fee . check it out on a rainy day and you  ll be satisfied .  ,0
this kind of film has become old hat by now  hasn  t it  the whole thing is syrupy nostalgia turned in upon itself in some kind of feedback loop .  br    br   it sure sounds like a good idea a great ensemble cast  some good gags  and some human drama about what could have  might have been . unfortunately  there is no central event that binds them all together  like there was in  the big chill   one of those seminal movies that spawned copycat films like this one . you end up wanting to see more of one or two particular people instead of getting short takes on everyone . the superficiality this creates is not just annoying  it  s maddening . the below  average script doesn  t help .  ,0
this is the first of  the complete dramatic works of william shakespeare  bbc series i  ve seen  and if all of them are like this  i might watch no more . being practically the full text of the play is everything this  romeo  juliet  has going for it  lacking in all other departments . alvin rakoff reveals himself as a dreadful director  both in the technical and artistic aspects . in the former  because he commits mistakes that even a first grade film student would wisely avoid . take in consideration  for example  the badly edited first shot of abraham and balthasar in the opening scene  or the nurse  s entering of friar lawrence  s cell  asking where  s romeo with him being so very in front of her that she  d clearly see him even if she was blind . and  in the latter  because every single one of the performers is misdirected  even if some of them are good actors . rebecca saire looks exactly the way i  ve always imagined juliet to look like  and she doesn  t seem to be a bad actress for a teenager  but her performance totally lacks passion of any kind . patrick ryecart as romeo is even worse  being not only as dull as juliet  but also way too old and not even good  looking  coming across as a combination of malcolm mcdowell and the chucky doll . putting them together makes impossible to think they feel anything for each other  let alone being the main players of the greatest love story ever written . alan rickman  in his screen debut  plays tybalt like if he was darth vader  which is a huge mistake that takes away the complexity that shakespeare intended  no character being a hero or a villain but all flawed human beings . this tybalt is so mean  looking that we don  t believe the characters  pity after his demise . as for paris  i kept thinking of  prince valium  from spaceballs . only celia johnson manages to do the character of the nurse some justice .  br    br   at    minutes  this production is unable to make us empathize with the characters  because the characters don  t empathize with each other and never seen to believe their own roles . the best screen version is still franco zeffirelli  s . but  to be fair  this bbc one isn  t nearly as bad as abominations like george cukor  s flamboyant geriatric version  or the crime against humanity that is baz luhrmann  s feature  length mtv video .     .  ,0
  contains slight spoilers   br    br   it  s interesting how anthony mann uses james stewart here . stewart is  of course  remembered by many as george bailey from frank capra  s  it  s a wonderful life   so it  s easy to find parallels between the two films . in  it  s a wonderful life   bailey gets to see the world as it would have been if he had never been born . in  the far country   stewart  s jeff webster  by not getting involved to help anyone else  except himself   gets to see essentially the same thing a world in which he  for all practical matters  doesn  t exist .  br    br   by not getting involved  and by attempting not to care about anyone   webster is forced to see those for whom he can  t help but care get hurt  pushed around  and even killed while he stands by and does nothing . this reminds the viewer of george bailey watching a world that has turned upside  down because he has also decided not to get involved by not ever having been born .  br    br   both movies end with the same image  a close  up of a ringing bell . stewart  by turning around his philosophy of non  involvement  has  it would seem  earned his  wings  .  ,1
the     s saw a vogue for documentary films about remote corners of the world  with an emphasis on wild animals  exotic terrain and primitive people with unusual cultures . despite the logistics of transporting a film crew to a distant and dangerous place  and then bringing  em back alive  with the film footage   such films were often much cheaper to make than were conventional hollywood features . . . because there were no expensive sets  costumes  or high  priced movie stars .  br    br   the most successful makers of such films  artistically and financially  were the team of martin e . johnson and his wife osa  who made several documentaries  sometimes with blatantly staged events  in africa and asia . the johnsons  safari films were extremely popular  inspiring several parodies . . . most notably wheeler  woolsey  s  so this is africa   in which the very sexy esther muir plays a character named mrs . johnson  martini  instead of martin e . johnson  geddit   . although several other filmmakers were producing safari documentaries at this time  the johnsons  films were the most popular in this genre because they relied heavily on humour . viewed from our own more enlightened  i hope  standpoint  this is a serious flaw in the johnsons  documentaries there are too many scenes in which the funny little brown or yellow people are made to look complete idiots who are easily outsmarted by the clever white bwana johnson and his wife .  br    br   one definite asset of these movies is the presence of osa johnson . ten years younger than her husband  she manages to seem young enough to be his daughter . while certainly not as attractive as the shapely blond esther muir  osa johnson was a pert brunette who gave ingratiating performances in front of the camera in all the films she co  produced with her husband .  br    br    congorilla  is probably the best of the johnsons  films . the shots of the congo are interesting and have some historical value as evidence of what this environment looked like in     . the shots of the pygmies and other natives are also interesting  although these suffer from the johnsons  penchant to stage events in a manner that makes the natives look  wild  and alien .  br    br   the best  and funniest  scene in  congorilla  is an improvised sequence in which osa johnson attempts to teach a jazz dance to some pygmy women .  the dance is the black bottom  no less . . . the same dance which bob hope famously taught to daisy and violet hilton  the conjoined twins .  wearing jodhpurs  riding boots  and a pith helmet  osa johnson starts scat  singing while she does high steps and slaps her knees in her attempt to teach this dance to the african women . meanwhile  they just stand there staring at her  apparently wondering what this crazy white woman is trying to accomplish . it  s a very funny scene  but it has unpleasant undertones . osa johnson is doing a dance that was invented by black americans the implication seems to be that black africans should instinctively be able to perform this dance after a brief demonstration  using natural rhythm  i guess  because it  s in their blood  or something .  br    br   i  ll rate  congorilla   points out of   . this film says a little bit about african life in the     s and rather more about american cultural perceptions in that same decade .  ,0
people tried to make me believe that the premise of this rubbishy supernatural horror  thriller was inspired by the actual last words spoken by an authentic serial killer  whose name escapes me at the moment  . whilst awaiting his execution in the electric chair  he claimed that his soul would return to life and continue to go on a never  ending murder spree . it  s not a highly original idea to revolve a horror film on  by the way . other low  budget turkeys implemented the exact same basic premise  like  house     shocker  and  ghost in the machine  . anyway   the first power   a . k . a  pentagram   isn  t a completely terrible effort  but the script overly reverts to clichs and lacks genuine thrills . the film starts off as an okay  albeit mundane serial killer flick in which obsessive cop  hero lou diamond philips pursues a maniac who carves bloody pentagrams into the chests of his victims . he receives unexpected help from a spiritual medium  played by the gorgeous and underrated tracy griffith . she leads him to the killer but also begs not to execute him  as that would result in an even bigger catastrophe  thanks to tess  helpful hints  detective logan quickly captures the killer and celebrates his death penalty  but patrick channing made a pact with satan himself and returns to the rotten streets of california to do some more killing .  the first power  gets pretty bad once the murderer reincarnates as a vengeful spirit . instead of using his newly gained satanic powers to wipe out the entire world  that  s what i would do in his position   channing simply prefers to play cat and mouse games with his nemesis the copper . he annoyingly calls him  buddy  boy  all the time and possesses the bodies of logan  s friends and colleagues in order to trick him . even though never really boring or poorly realized  it  s a very weak film to endure  mostly because you constantly get the feeling of dj  vu . writer  director robert resnikoff shamelessly uses every dreadful clich  the killer got sexually abused as a child  and even the players  lines can easily be predicted . as soon as griffith explains she  s able to predict the future  you just know that  somewhere at some point in the film  she  s going to say the ridiculously overused line  i tell people who to live their lives  but my own life is a mess  . yawn . lou diamond philips  performance is adequate enough  but it  s rather difficult to take that youthful rebel of  la bamba  and  stand and deliver  serious as a tough copper . there also are decent supportive roles for mykelti williamson   forrest gump    carmen argenziano   when a stranger calls   and b  movie horror legend david gale   re  animator   appears in a minuscule cameo at the very beginning of the film .  ,0
the recent boom of dating show on u . s . television screens has reached a fevered pitch since the first episode of  the bachelor .  unsuspecting audiences have since been subjected to countless clones and variations  including  the bachelorette    joe millionaire    for love or money   and the execrable  married by america .  hoping to cash in on this trend  and simultaneously tap and exploit a new demographic  bravo has unleashed the disastrous  boy meets boy  upon the world . and may they have mercy on us all .  br    br   the premise is simple and is designed to be light  hearted an eligible gay man is courted by a number of suitors  eliminated show by show until one is left  but there  s a twist . half of the men are actually straight . this is not much of a big deal  but the inherent viciousness of the scenario kicks in after hearing the pay  off if  at the end of the show  the gay man picks a straight man in disguise  the straight man wins a cash prize . the gay man gets nothing  or at least nothing more than a few parting gifts  a pat on the back  and a hearty round of  aren  t you embarrassed  well  thanks for playing    br    br   just the like the equally painful  queer eye for the straight guy   another bravo program   this show is another example of stereotypes run amok . what makes it even worse  though  is the fact that straight men are playing up these stereotypes for cash . the producers of this show believe that all you have to do is put enough hair gel in a man  s hair  dress up in abercrombie  fitch with a pair of designer sandals  strip him of all body hair and fat and voila  it  s the gay equivalent to putting a white performer in blackface  and just as offensive to those of us   like myself   who are genuinely gay and don  t dress  act like that . it implies that gays have no variance or chance for individuality  that they can  t behave like real people  only like stereotypes . never mind the fact that the bank of suitors is sorely lacking in any kind of diversity . all are gym  toned  most are white  and all look far too scrubbed and cleaned .  br    br   this is another example of how  instead of fostering acceptance of gays as dynamic individuals capable of variance and change  hollywood has again taken a stereotype and run with it all the way to the bank . i feel genuinely dirty watching this show  as show any gay man who sees this unabashed parade of soft  core pornography masquerading as legitimate television .  out of   .  ,0
i have yet to see a film with nolte in it that i did not like . however  this being said  he  s made a lot of films and i  ve seen just a few . in my minds eye i am keeping the images of his performance here and the one in  the thin red line  . nolte has a a full range of acting talents . when it  s necessary to shout he roars like a wounded lion . his best moments are the ones i treasure in actors when he just emotes through facial  hand and body gestures  without saying anything . having come to the conclusion that our present generation of actors  by and large  have no appreciation of what an actor can do without speaking  having no conscious appreciation of the mastery of keaton and chaplin  this generation of actors relies far too much on the mechanical wizardry of computers . of course it is also just a sign of the times we live in . had chaplin lived in our times . . . . who knows  he just might as well have become an aficionado of cgi tools .  br    br   i have not read the vonnegut novel from which this film comes to the screen . however  the plot is not so far fetched or convoluted that we cannot follow the path laid  even with all its surprises . of course on the outset it appears preposterous . however  it is also not impossible .  br    br   consider these for starters a spy at the heart of the third reich he extraordinary life of fritz kolbe  america  s most important spy in world war ii by delattre and prichard  look at amazon for more details  . consider history undercover piercing the reich american spies inside nazi germany dvd  i saw this here http   store . aetv . com  html  product  index . jhtml  id       seems to be a history channel production .  br    br   so  is the story ridiculous  far fetched yes  impossible  no . back to the plot . nolte  s character is recruited and accepts an impossibly dangerous mission and unfortunately the script does not give us an adequate reason why he accepts . was it a type of passivity  that he got sucked into this role as it says because it was the best story he had ever written and he got to play the part  that  s a hard thing to imagine any of us would grasp . but  it was an unusual time and people did extraordinary things .  br    br   the acting throughout the film by the entire cast is excellent and as people have pointed out alan arkin  always fantastic  is very good in a small role .  br    br   i was really shocked by the ending of the film  no  i won  t spoil it  and it made me feel terrible about the choice . did this person feel that the road was finally over and that he had spoken all that was necessary and that any more would be chapters added to a life already filled with many burnt pages  hard to say but it really jolts .  br    br   nolte gives one of the finest performances you can expect . . . . the premises of the film make you wonder about a lot of things . it  s very entertaining and provoking . what great movies should be . a bit long but worth it . by the way  the movie music has selections from one of the best living composers arvo part .  ,1
i saw it in a posh movie theater where the audience is usually white  educated  and urban . the showing i attended had a sprinkling of african  americans  and it made the difference in audience  reaction between the two groups a wonderful social commentary on the state of race relations in this country . basically  the white folks were afraid to laugh or laughed nervously at the funny bits   and there are many    because they  d be  laughting at blacks   while the blacks also stayed pretty silent because many couldn  t laugh at themselves in front of the whites .  br    br   i  on the other hand  being asian  and thus belonging to neither group   had a great time viewing this satire of rap culture and its egos  trappings  values  pseudo  philosophies . the cast is talented and does at great job becoming the characters portrayed . the songs are too funny to be believed .  br    br   this film is one of the best pseudo  documentaries to come along  including  a mighty wind   ,1
if you were a director that was looking to cast female victims for a slasher movie  then surely it would make sense to add a couple of porn stars  it  s not as if they  re inexperienced in front of the camera  they have no qualms with the requisite nudity and how many unattractive porn queens can you name  christian viel obviously recognized the potential of mixing hardcore actresses with hard  gore effects and so he cast four of adult cinema  s sexiest and most notorious stars . jenna jameson  chasey lain  ginger lynn allen and taylor hayes all turn up for cameos in arguably the most intriguing slasher flick to be released since scream reinvigorated the genre .  br    br   samhain was originally intended for a cinema release in october      thus keeping in check with the halloween  based synopsis . unfortunately  the shoot was plagued by numerous problems  which have thus prevented the feature from achieving the exposure that it deserves . last i heard it had been signed by film     here in the uk and was penned for a late october release direct to dvd . unfortunately that label has got a peerlessly abysmal track record with dtv slashers . not content with polluting our shelves with camp blood and its follow up  they were also responsible for unleashing granny  bleed and the rancid paranoid . could samhain finally be worthwhile ammunition to their contemptible catalogue cannon   br    br   five canadian  american students and their teacher head to southern ireland as part of their history course . upon arrival they are told the legend of a cannibalistic clan that roamed the hills of scotland and murdered locals for food . the cannibals were eventually caught and burnt at the stake  but it  s rumored that one of the tribe escaped and headed to the woodland of ireland to find refuge . after the kids have settled and begun doing what all massacre  fodder does in these flicks  the mandatory goody two  shoes  and definite heroine candidate  begins to be spooked by a shadow creeping around late at night . could it be that the flesh hungry maniac is still at large in the forest  well what do you think   br    br   it looks as if samhain  s production was jinxed right from the start . almost immediately wallmart refused to develop jenna jameson  s nude make  up shots  and chasey lain began acting characteristically like a drugged  out primadonna . finally to add insult to injury  the producers got cold feet just before the flick was about to hit shelves and began talking of re  editing and removing all the gore . reports have said that they were unhappy about the copious amounts of violence and they wanted to trim scenes down so it would achieve an r rating . veil of course disagreed  seeing how his entire synopsis was boosted by its creatively graphic display . eventually after months of arguments  the director parted company with warehouse productions and the feature was once again locked in the vaults .  br    br   despite countless disruptions  veil  s slasher opus is still one of the best genre pieces to be released since the new millennium . the copy i was sent was the pre  release screener  which was obviously a test press without sound effects or the complete soundtrack . but still it boasted a few credible jump  scares  some superb cinematography and a couple of the goriest set pieces that i  ve seen for some time . one guy is disemboweled via his rectum before being strangled with his own intestine  jenna jameson is stripped naked and gutted in unflinching close up and chasey lain ends up  spilling her guts  after an unfortunate rescue attempt from her boyfriend  richard grieco  . even though the murders are uncommonly gruesome  samhain never feels mean spirited  which is basically due to the characters being thinly portrayed as basic slasher clichs . in all honesty the script was perhaps the movies biggest downfall  because the dialogue was not so much inspired by wes craven  s scream movies as it was flagrantly cut and pasted from them .  br    br   certainly the inclusion of the mouth  watering jenna jameson was a great move by the producers . her fans will be excited to know that she does whip off her top  as expected  and so does chasey lain and taylor hayes . but samhain is no soft porn movie  and it benefits from sticking to the structure that it set out to produce . it  s worth noting that the aforementioned xxx stars almost out  perform the supposed  actors  of the feature  which isn  t much of a complement . ginger lynn was at least notable  if you ignore the shameful  oirish accent   and her battle with the hulking killer was superbly performed and choreographed by alan chou . taylor and jenna delivered expectedly poor dramatics  which could have been caused by the numerous problems on  set . veil  s direction of the cinematography was excellently constructed and he provides some much  needed injections of suspense . exciting and crisp photography is mixed with a good flair for storytelling and the net result is a slasher extravaganza to satisfy even the most critical gore hounds .  br    br   it will be interesting to see what kind of final cut is released of samhain . rumor has it that a second director was drafted in to shoot a different ending  and i  m curious as to how much of the explicit gore will remain intact for worldwide distribution . if the end result is only half as good as the rough print that i watched  then it  s still better than nearly all of the genre pieces that have been unleashed over the past ten years . this one is certainly worth checking out  ,1
i was totally impressed by shelley adrienne  s  waitress        . this movie only confirms what was clear from that movie . adrienne was a marvelously talented writer  director  an original and unique artist . she managed to show the miseries of everyday life with absurd humor and a real warm optimistic and humanistic tendency . ally sheedy steals this movie with a terrific performance as a woman who has fallen over the edge . male lead reg rodgers  looking like judd nelson  is fine . there is also a great cameo by ben vereen . the song at the end of the movie  the bastard song  written by adrienne can stand as her optimistic eulogy  br    br    it  s a world of suffering   br    br   in a sea of pain   br    br   no matter how much sun you bring   br    br   you  re pummeled by the rain . . .  br    br   don  t let the heartless get you down   br    br   don  t greet the heartless at your door   br    br   don  t live among the heartless   ,1
for a first film in a proposed series it achieves the right balance . it is done with style and class showing modesty  s early days as a refugee and the start of her rise to power in the criminal world . i think it is a very honest  true portrayal of her character exactly as the writer peter o  donnell intended . alexandra staden as modesty is stunningly beautiful and an excellent choice . she acts very convincingly as the tough survivor with an exterior of cool  intelligent  innocence . and full marks to tarantino for choosing an unknown actress for the role  much more believeable to have a new face creating the part . i  m looking forward to the next film .  ,1
i was too young to remmeber when i first saw this movie . but i saw it for like the second time about  years ago . my sister told me i had to see it . now my whole family has it memorized . we quote it at least once a day . i absolutly love this movie . i still laugh after all this time . sure  it  s about a really  really drunk millionare that is irresponsible . the whole point is that he still has the humanity lost in the others that we see in the movie . and that he is willing to give it all up for love . i highly recomend this movie to anyone who wants a laugh . a lot of laughs . its hallarious  sweet  and if your a movie buff  it will truely change your idea of  funny  . watch it with a group of your friends or your family and i promise  you will never have nothing to talk about ever again with some authur lines in your head . it will make you laugh for years to come .  br    br   it is really hard  in my family  to find a movie that everyone likes . but this movie  i feel  made us closer . and i know it will do the same for you    ,1
i remember watching this movie several times as a very young kid  and there were parts of it  many in fact  that i did not understand . i think i have seen it once as an adult  and i then understood those parts . the only problem with viewing it as an adult was that it was not entertaining to me at all . so what kind of movie is this  is it a  kids movie   not hardly . it contains language and subject matter not suitable for kids . is it a hyperbole of what every parent feels like they are going through with their own children  maybe  but then why wouldn  t it focus more on john ritter  s character instead of junior  when a film has a   year  old as its main character  in order to do well with it  s audience  it should be a movie for the seven and under crowd  otherwise people older than that will have no way to relate  even   year  olds wouldn  t want to see a movie about a kid who is whole year younger than them  . i  m pretty sure this film did not do well in the box office  and the reason has to be because it was unable to find a niche in the market .  ,0
a trio of buddies  sergeants all in the british army  carouse  brawl their way across imperial india . intensely loyal to each other  they meet their greatest  most deadly challenge when they encounter the resurgence of a hideous cult  its demented  implacable guru . now they must rely on the lowliest servant of the regiment  the water carrier gunga din  to save scores of the queen  s soldiers from certain massacre .  br    br   based more on the three musketeers than kipling  s classic poem  this is a wonderful adventure epic  a worthy entry in hollywood  s golden year of     . filled with suspense  humor  while keeping the romantic interludes to the barest minimum  it grips the interest of the viewer and holds it right up to the  sentimental  conclusion .  br    br   it is practically fruitless to discuss the performance nuances of the three stars  cary grant  victor mclaglen  douglas fairbanks jr .  as they are really all thirds of a single organism  inseparable and  to all intents  purposes  indistinguishable . however  this diminishes nothing of the great fun in simply watching them have a glorious time .  br    br    it  s interesting to note  parenthetically  that mclaglen boasted of a distinguished world war one military career fairbanks would have a sterling record in world war two  mostly in clandestine affairs  earning himself no fewer than  honorary knighthoods after the conflict while grant reportedly worked undercover for british intelligence  keeping an eye on hollywood nazi sympathizers .   br    br   the real acting laurels here should go to sam jaffe  heartbreaking in the title role . he infuses the humble man with radiant dignity  enormous courage  making the last line of kipling  s poem ring true . he is unforgettable .  br    br   montague love is properly stalwart as the regimental major  whilst eduardo ciannelli is evil incarnate as the thuggee guru . the rest of the cast  joan fontaine  robert coote  lumsden hare  are effective but have little to do . movie mavens will recognize cecil kellaway in the tiny role of miss fontaine  s father .  br    br   the film picks its villains well . the demonic thuggee cult  worshipers of the hideous  blood  soaked kali  hindu goddess of destruction  was the bane of indian life for  centuries  ritualistically strangling up to       victims a year . in     the british military  in cooperation with a number of princely states  succeeded in ultimately suppressing the religion . henceforth it would remain the stuff of novels  nightmares .  ,1
opening the film with a bach toccata is an aural hint of what is to unfold in this intense drama . all the compositional devices bach perfected to keep his listener  and the performer  intrigued and entertained applies to this film . there isn  t a mutual tenderness between the two lead characters and the lead female in the final scene i feel is justified in stating she was raped even though her victimizer feels she was forewarned that he was a cad . mamet compellingly explores the emotional chasm and differences between the genders but i feel he is clueless about how they actually compliment one another given a healthy sense of humor . if mamet ever developed a healthy humorous take on the interaction between the genders i wonder how this work would have ended  as it exists it is very somber and mean spirited .  ,1
you can survive surviving christmas . i thought the television version was a bit edited way down . i like ben afleck . he plays drew johnson  a family  less adult  who is willing to pay complete strangers . the valcos starring james gandolfini and catherine o  hara as the parents and christina applegate as lisa valco  the daughter . drew is lonely around the holidays because he doesn  t have a family of his own so he rents out a family in the chicago suburbs for a quarter million dollars . bill macy who i best remember for playing maude  s husband arthur is hired to play duda  the grandfather . when the whole situation comes crashing down  the truth can be painful . the valcos household is crumbling apart from the drew situation . drew  s rich girlfriend and her parents make a surprising visit . you can  t buy what you wish for  the acting and writing is mediocre but the first rate cast pulls it through to the final scene .  ,1
i just saw this delightful japanese feature film at the  th annual roger ebert overlooked film festival in the historic virginia theatre in champaign  illinois .  br    br   although this film  subtitled in english  has ballroom dancing as its heart  the film actually shows the world outside of japan how the rigid structures of family  employment  salaryman   and recreation still exist in modern day japan .  br    br   writer  director suo masauki i follow japanese custom of presenting the family name  last name  first and the given name  last   uses the not so very popular theme of ballroom dancing to show the societal structure of japan .  br    br   also  i shall not use the movie character names when world readers may not be familiar with japanese formal names which may confuse . i will refer to the  br    br   actors by their professional acting name as listed in the internet data movie base .   br    br   he enlists the aid of his real  life wife  professional ballet dancer kusakari tamiyo in her first and  so far  only motion picture . she is a dance teacher at her father  s dance studio . yet  her real ambition is to compete once more in an international dance competition which she was disqualified from in the past . no  i won  t say  why .  see the movie .  br    br   salaryman yakusyo koji is the main star of the film . a veteran of about   films since      he gives a sterling performance of a    s something companyman  br    br   who has a lovely wife  teenage daughter  and just purchased the house of his  br    br   longing .  br    br   and  yet  something is missing from his own inner happiness . see this film to learn how he becomes  involved  with ballroom dancing and secretly goes to  br    br   lessons . most of the dancing characters are liberated from the traditional  br    br   japanese hierarchy of social structure . they are friendly and warm and inviting . of course  this is in sharp contrast to how japanese society is structured with it  s  place for everyone and everyone in its place  philosophy .  br    br   the movie has so many funny moments . the almost      theater goers broke  br    br   into spontaneous laughter during many of the comedic moments . this proves  br    br   that comedy has no foreign language .  br    br   veteran actor takenaka naoto is funny and brilliant as well as watanabe eriko . they are two funny character actors .  br    br   one could purchase and read a college text book regarding the structure of life in japan  or  you could watch this fine film and begin to understand how the  br    br   people of japan grow up in a fairly rigid societal structure . watching the movie  shall we dansu   is a quick immersion into further study and viewing other  br    br   japanese films .  br    br   i recommend this film to all . it  s funny  it  s charming  it will make you cry a little  and it will warm your heart .  br    br    ,1
i have recently seen this movie due to jake  s recent success with brokeback mountain . i figured i would see the movies that i missed . i had no expectations going into the film so was astounded that i had missed this movie at all . it  s a gripping father and son tale  and it is also an underdog story . i even shed a tear at the finale of this wonderful tale . this movie appeals to all ages . the only reason i give it a  out of   is that it slows down a little in the middle  but it comes back strong in the end . the acting was great  the story was magnificent  and the cinematography was captivating given the setting of the film . go see this movie  rent it  buy it  watch it  love it  i know i did   ,1
i was excited to see a sitcom that would hopefully represent indian candians but i found this show to be not funny at all . the producers and cast are probably happy to get both bad and good feed back because as far as they are concerned it  s getting talked about  i was ready for some stereotyping and have no problem with it because stereotypes exist for a reason  they are usually true . but there really wasn  t anything funny about these stereotypical characters . the  fresh of the boat  dad  who doesn  t understand his daughter . the radical feminist muslim daughter  who by the way is a terrible actress   and the young modern indian man trying to run his mosque as politically correct as he can  he  s a pretty good actor  i only see him getting better  .  br    br   it is very contrived and the dialog doesn  t flow that well . there was so much potential for something like this but sadly i think it failed  and don  t really care to watch another episode .  br    br   i did however enjoy watching a great canadian actress sheila mccarthy again  she  s always a treat and a natural at everything she does  too bad her daughter in the show doesn  t have the same acting abilities   ,0
i saw this movie in its own time period  when having a baby out of wedlock not only ruined your life  but stamped your child as a bastard . in these days of  single mothers  that may seem very far  fetched  but it was very true . and i  m not crazy about laughing at someone who is stammering  either . between these two problems i had difficulty finding this movie funny . at that time i didn  t know who had directed it or what a marvelous reputation he had . i did know who betty hutton was  and she just made me nervous because she was so frenetic . i loved  bringing up baby   but i find this movie just embarrassing . i  m sure the punch at some church functions probably was spiked  but i was the one needing a drink after watching this again . the idea the girl would have to be drunk in order to  get married  and get pregnant just added to the misery . an entire town could turn on you under these circumstances  so the outcome of this movie is really the funny part . of course  shoot me  i don  t like  it  s a wonderful life  either .  ,0
spoilers i  m always surprised at how many people gave this game good reviews . it was awful . the script and voice acting alone ruined it . gabriel and grace are the most unlikeable characters in the game . you almost pray for their deaths . and worst of all  there are less vampires in this game than there were werewolves in the beast within .  br    br   the lack of real vampires was incredibly disappointing . if you  re expecting some kind of anne rice style vampire story  forget it . this game  s story has very little to do with vampires . you won  t even see any till about the very end and even then  you won  t get to fight them .  br    br   the story has radical  and pretty much blasphemous  views of christianity . i  m amazed it got off the drawing board . i  m not even christian and i found it offensive . mostly  the story centers around a search for the holy grail and buried treasure . the kidnapping of a royal baby  which should have been the focus  really gets pushed aside . there is no sense of urgency for gabriel to find the baby . in fact  he almost never asks anyone about the baby after the first few time blocks .  br    br   the graphics are pretty bad . the characters move about at a snail  s pace even on the best of systems . they are chunky and outdated . and it  s hard to go from the fmv of the beast within to this horrible game engine for blood of the sacred .  br    br   the relationship between gabriel and grace takes an awful turn  too . i really don  t know why it was so horribly rushed  but they do sleep together . and it  s not fun . gabriel spends most of the game telling his best friend mosely how he thinks of grace as more of a sister and he doesn  t think she  s the one for him . and he seems really grossed out that they slept together . but he  s so unlikeable throughout the game  that you almost don  t even care at that point . his dialogue was the worst in the game . and he was constantly making stupid sexual innuendos at anything female the entire game . by the end of the game  grace leaves him with what appears to be a dear john letter . i guess she was as fed up with him as most of the players were .  br    br   i found the story to be annoying and boring . i was expecting to play a story of a royal baby who was kidnapped by vampires . and i was expecting to get to see and fight vampires  maybe even have gabriel or grace turn into one . but no . instead  the story focused on the author  s warped vision of christianity . what a shame . here they had the elements for a great adventure  and instead we got this .  br    br   for me  the only interesting parts of the game were actually at the very end . we do get a few action style puzzles at the end . but it wasn  t worth suffering through the entire game to get to them .  br    br   i can  t really recommend this game . i had gotten it back when it came out  years ago  and i hated the game engine so much that i shelved it for years . i only recently dusted it off to see what i  d been missing . and now  i  m very sorry that i did . my favorite characters were ruined . i hope there will be a fourth game just to redeem the series . and i hope they get it right next time . it would be a terrible shame to end the series with this installment .  ,0
the sopranos is arguably the greatest show in dramatic television history .  br    br   its hard to think of another series that boasts so much intelligence  sublime writing or first rate performances .  br    br   across its epic scope it produces fresh and iconic characters and a constant level of high quality . centering around the life of one tony soprano  a man who lives in two families . one is the conventional wife and two kids nuclear family the other a huge new jersey mafia group  of which he is the boss of both . played by james gandolfini  of true romance and the mexican fame  tony is a fascinating  scary but also likable guy . full praise must be given to gandolfini for making a womanising and horrifically aggressive brute a genuinely identifiable and perfect leading man . contemporay american drama has never had such an arresting and iconic figure as tony .  br    br   the cast of hundreds never boasts a flat performance and such stand out characters like paulie walnuts and ralph cifaretto will stick in your memory for ever .  br    br   the true genius of this tale however  is the creator and writers bravery and revolutionary take on a conventional drama series . twenty minute long dream sequences  powerful and original use of symbolism and metaphorical imagery and truly shocking scenes of violence . yet all this style is met by truly touching themes of love  honour and respect for family . the series never becomes cold hearted or gratuitous .  br    br   with tv now competitive and often poor the sopranos stands tall above the rest as america  s most original and compelling drama . forget family redifined . this is television redifined .  ,1
i remember stumbling upon this special while channel  surfing in     . i had never heard of barbra before . when the show was over  i thought  this is probably the best thing on tv i will ever see in my life .    years later  that has held true . there is still nothing so amazing  so honestly astonishing as the talent that was displayed here . you can talk about all the super  stars you want to  this is the most superlative of them all   br    br   you name it  she can do it . comedy  pathos  sultry seduction  ballads  barbra is truly a story  teller . her ability to pull off anything she attempts is legendary . but this special was made in the beginning  and helped to create the legend that she quickly became . in spite of rising so far in such a short time  she has fulfilled the promise  revealing more of her talents as she went along . but they are all here from the very beginning . you will not be disappointed in viewing this .  ,1
young and attractive japanese people are getting on the wrong side of some curse again  this time it involves mobile phones . various people die until the disgruntled spirit behind it all is unearthed  so essentially if you  ve seen more than  recent japanese horror films you can plot this film in the dark with your hands tied .  br    br   the main attraction here is the fact that takashi miike is behind the camera . so far i  ve been more impressed with his low key works like city of lost souls  however as one missed call plodded along i was yearning for his more renowned envelope pushing of dead or alive or the overly pseudo  cronenberg style of audition . despite a lot of his films being essentially empty  at least they do have merits such as these  or at least something to keep your attention like tadanobu asano prancing about in shiny suits impersonating johnny depp . there  s none of that in one missed call there  s just very little of credit the acting is bland and average  there is very little  nothing  in all honesty  in the way of scares or suspense  and in places it  s just downright boring .  br    br   however  there are moments where miike  s glacier  like sense of humour seeps through the bland commercialism most notably with the instance of the tv show intent on filming the demise of one of the cursed subjects  and the tv programmer more concerned about his ratings than the girls  life . but aside from this there is nothing to suggest it is miike behind the camera most notably his usual visual flair has vanished without a trace  and that includes his famous gore   although it  s more likely he just didn  t have any enthusiasm for the project  and i can understand why . one missed call isn  t offensively bad . it  s just frustratingly average .  br    br   miike obviously loves directing . with his huge yearly output it  s obvious he isn  t going to be     concerned about all his projects . but even with this in mind  one missed call felt like he was just paying the bills .  ,0
a painfully protracted  maudlin and predictable drama  my twenty  fifth sidney lumet film  garbo talks  gets filed precipitously on the low quality end of my quest .  br    br   the film documents a harried young working man named gilbert  ron silver   who is son to estelle rolle  anne bancroft   eccentric  feisty and above all  an obsessive fan of greta garbo . when estelle becomes afflicted with a brain tumor  her son decides to go on an obsessive quest of his own track down greta garbo  and bring her to his mother .  br    br   anne bancroft is in full  on  chew  the  scenery auntie  mame mode here  that kind of feisty ol  gal that film loves  where she mouths off to people  and stands up for her ideals  and ends up in jail all the time . she stands outside of the film as an obvious artificial construct  and every scene with her is yuk  yuk lame every note striking false . the rest of the characters are equally as one  dimensional  but tremendously less  interesting . ron silver is flat as can be  and his attempted love triangle is as telegraphed as anything else in the film he is dating affluent lisa rolfe  carrie fisher   but becomes smitten with oddball co  worker jane mortimer  catherine hicks   and i called every scene three scenes before they happen .  br    br   that  s the other problem . one  dimensional characters can survive if they are posited in an intriguing and captivating story  but there  s simply nothing here . the film  s pace is glacial  resplendent with extraneous material that strengthens absolutely nothing  and when the film does begin to follow a linear plot  it  s both plodding and uninteresting . there are plenty of guest stars  so to speak  including harvey fierstein as a gay new yorker  imagine that  in yet another highly inessential scene .  br    br   late in the film  it attempts to make a halfway  decent statement on the nature of idolatry and its role in our lives  but by that time  none of the characters exist as real people  and the film had bored me into submission  so it functions as a case of far  too  little  far  too  late . the film is my twenty  fifth lumet  directed film  making him easily my most  viewed director  but outside of a couple egregious misses  a stranger among us  anyone    he hasn  t plumbed the painfully uninteresting depths of garbo talks .  br    br   grade  .      c  c        of    of         of   lumet films  ,0
i discovered this movie with a retailer selling oop  s . and this one surely is an oop . one year after the exorcist she  s back in business with this movie but what we all new was that the career of blair never broke out  she never became a mega star . that  s one of the reason  s many of her films are oop . she gives a good performance in this movie . it  s about a reject not recognized by her parents and doesn  t have any friends . played at an age of   playing a girl of    that  s funny . the movie is also known for the rape scene in the showers were they stick a broomstick up her virginity . in most editions it  s cut out  why  i don  t know  no blood is involved  okay  blair is butt naked but nothing is shown  no ta so nothing to offend people . but the movie is slow  extremely slow . it doesn  t happy normally to me but i almost felt asleep . it  s just about that   year old becoming a rebel against society but no blood flows  no gore no nothing . why this is categorized in horror is still a wonder to me . if you  re a fan of blair  buy it if you can find it otherwise leave it as it is .  ,0
this film on paper looked like it could possibly be good  after watching though i realised that this film was completely terrible   the plot has no meaning  and i think i counted the best part of     cut scenes each one making the film more annoying boring and ridiculous . i watched this late night pitch black no noise at all just to add to the scariness of it but the truth is the only thing that scared me was the music  what they would call tragic music  they play opera i mean be serious   this film sums up all of what is not good about this type of film . to be honest ill say no more but watch at your own risk this film is just complete rubbish  enjoy    ,0
i saw this movie on mystery science theater    . it sucked so much . if i hadn  t been watching it on mst  k  i probably would  ve thrown it out the window . the characters were incredibly lame and it didn  t provide much of a plot in my opinion .  ,0
sometimes i watch a movie and am really impressed by it  and still it is not easy to explain why i liked it that much . this is mostly true for the uncommon movies  the ones one can hardly compare with the rest out there . goodnight mister tom is one of these special movies . there is a lot of emotion in that movie  and the acting was so good that while watching the movie  i was crying and laughing as the story went on . the young nick robinson  is a young boy  william  evacuated from london because of the air strikes there during the second world war . mr . tom played by john thaw is an old man leaving in the village the evacuated children were send to .  br    br   at first tom refuses to take any responsibilities  such as taking care for a troubled young lad  but accepts since he is left without a choice . during the stay mr . tom discovers how horrible the life has been for the william  alongside his luggage his mom sent a belt and written instructions to the host of her son  not to hesitate to use it . this belt is berried in the field  never to be used in such a brutal manner . mr . tom provides a real home for william  and the boy is happy with his new life  he goes to school  makes new friends and discovers hidden talents . all of the sudden a letter william is called home in london with a letter mentioning that she is not feeling welland it starts all over again  only this time it gets much worse there are many feelings you can sense in this movie  love  fear  sadness  happiness  pain  hope  and much more . goodnight mr . tom is another masterpiece of the british cinema comparable only with others such as dear frankie and billy elliot  if one is to compare . i have truly enjoyed watching it and highly recommend it . before finishing this review i would also like to mention the great performance of thomas orange in the role of zac  reminded me of a friend of mine from my own childhood    ,1
if you  re a t  rex  marc bolan fan  i recommend you check this out . it shows a whimsical side of marc bolan as well as ringo starr  apparently having a pretty good time shooting some of the scenes that aren  t part of the concert  but fun to watch  leaving you with a sense of getting to know them as just people  and when the concert is shown a talented musician  both playful and professional that rocks and seems to impress the screaming girls . watching him in concert  you would never know that being a rock star is a job  but just having a great time playing some great songs with some good friends  like elton john and ringo starr appearing in some of the live performances . true  there are a few songs missing that i would like to have seen on there  but like any album it can  t have everything . i just bought this in      but if i would have know it came out in      i would have definitely bought it years ago . sad and strange that a man with so many songs about his love for cars  would never learn to drive and would die in a car crash   ,1
johnathan frakes is a good actor and  when he  s not directing a family film  a fine director . but  he really shouldn  t have directed this movie  and the screenplay should  ve been rejected . the director and writers must understand what the original tv show was really about  as well as who the characters were and how they worked . the original series had many episodes with razor  sharp writing using good dialogue and with situations that american producers would never consider using in children  s programming  much less a movie  which made the original series so well received by adults . i mean  the tracys were college graduates and some of them did even drank alcohol and smoked tobacco  and  there were characters who did get killed  although most were bad guys . if they had written it the way that it was originally done  which isn  t dumbing things down with poor dialogue  kindergarten humor  and a weak plot  this universal  studio canal joint venture wouldn  t have such bad reviews .  br    br   this motion picture is almost pure blasphemy . if you  ve seen the original supermarionation series  then you  ll know what i  m talking about   br    br   the first thing that was out of place and annoying were the constant references to ford motor company  even going so far that lady penelope was riding around in a disfigured ford thunderbird made up to look like fab   instead of using what would  ve been more appropriate considering ms . penelope  s station  not to mention being more faithful to the original   a rolls  royce fab   . she  s supposed to be a distinguished member of british society  hence the preference for england  s finest make of motorcars in the original series . one other reviewer here indicated that penelope wouldn  t be caught dead in a ford . he  s pretty much right in the context that the idea of her riding in a ford doesn  t work . at least they could have had penelope ride in a jaguar made up like fab  since jaguar is a british car make that is owned by ford  but no  they had to use a straight ford  but the ford product placement doesn  t end there . every single car you may see is a ford  even the news flash that is shown on the tv sets in the movie were sponsored by ford  ford  ford  ford  the predominance of ford vehicles makes this movie an obvious marketing vehicle for ford .  br    br   the original series had a design that was futuristic for the     s and still remains ahead of its time even today . but  the futuristic design in the original series worked because there was an effort to make the design look practical and functional . this kind of treatment didn  t exist in the movie  where everything is stylized to excess  defeating the sense of functionality and practicality . a lot of things that were done in the design of the movie were done strictly for style  many times with no sense of function to give that style a sense of reason .  br    br   the original series relied on good acting performances of the voice talent to overcome the limited expressions in the puppets  bringing them to life in the episodes . the brilliant and lively music score by barry gray helped even further to connect the audience with the story  the characters  and how everything came together to help achieve the super objective  a little bit of stanislavski talk  . the movie  on the other hand  had some overly grating performances . anthony edwards overplayed brains to a fault  bill paxton as jeff tracy just didn  t work despite decent acting  one of few   there were better choices for the hood than ben kingsley  and many others that i don  t care to mention  it would take too long  . quite simply  the puppets were more believable  second was the overly generic and underwhelming music score by hans zimmer  sounding more like a mix between  days of thunder  and  apollo   .   br    br   and  of course  the hood . the hood in the original series had an ability to communicate with kyrano through a statue of kyrano as an outlet for esp contact . but  that was where his extraordinary capability ended . he  s a master of disguise and deception  which allows him to sneak around undetected  for the most part  anyways  to gather information of the thunderbirds vehicles for his own means . he also uses weapons for his own defense  including pistols  and generally collects information using a film camera  although he tried to steal thudnerbirds  and  in the     s united artists release of  thunderbird    which was the last thunderbirds show filmed in supermarionation and was the second thunderbirds theatrical release  . but  while he is a nemesis of international rescue  the hood isn  t the villain in every thunderbirds episode and he tends to avoid direct confrontation with international rescue . in the movie  he  s obviously the main villain  but he and his cohorts seem to act more like morons  along with the hood having extended mind control ability  including the ability to move objects and move himself into flight for brief periods of time . this totally deviates from the hood as a character in the original series with one that may leave kids laughing and people familiar with the series scratching their heads in confusion or leaving the theater in disgust .  br    br   there are more criticisms  but the     word limit for imdb reviews will not allow me to list all of them . so  i will close with the point being made that i didn  t enjoy this movie . as a matter of fact  i think it sucks  having seen the original series and supermarionation movies  thunderbirds are go  thunderbird    i was hoping for something a lot better than this .  br    br   the original supermarionation was a lot more sophisticated and elegant than this live action farce .  and that  s saying it nicely .   kip wells  ,0
purple rain is a great film if you are a    something music lover who partied to prince music in the     s . the story is a much  used formula rising musical talent must overcome personal and professional hurdles to find his audience and self  respect . prince is a bad actor  but his performance  especially of purple rain  i would die  u make it worth sitting through the film . he is himself and as a showman  as powerful on stage as mick jagger or michael jackson  circa thriller . apollonia kotero  a former prince protg  is beautiful and shows some acting talent and chemistry with prince  but her script doesn  t let her far . morris day and other supporting actors provide comedic elements .  ,1
i think jason lee has huge potential  but this was the wrong vehicle in which to attempt to break out as a star . the plot is awful  the comedy is awful . i laughed twice  i think for relief  because in retrospect  they were fairly lame jokes . i found myself scared for the future of fletch  and had to console myself that it was the film that was flawed  not lee .  br    br   julia stiles and selma blair are hot  but i recommend looking at the still photos on this website to figure that out  instead of this film . save your time .  star .  ,0
soon after watching this film you will realize why it didn  t even make it to the theaters  this movie does not deserve the  prequel  tag . instead this is a common theme in hollywood  rip off previously good movies with disastrous prequels  sequels  etc .  br    br   this film  s plot was bouncing all over the place like a ping pong ball  and the character development was non  existent . i seriously felt like i was watching a comedy at some points in the movie because the acting was so bad . p diddy needs to stop tainting movies with his horrible acting  he actually made me laugh every time .  br    br   the only good thing that comes out of this movie is jaclyn desantis  who looks excellent in this movie and actually brought some enjoyment from watching this film .  br    br   if you are a big carlito  s way fan  i recommend you not watch this . if you decide to watch it anyway then treat this movie as if it ripped off the original  because that is exactly what it did .  ,0
how sad there is no option to post a mark lower than  . i watched this piece of nonsense and could barely believe what i was watching . every single part of the film was awful . music  acting  direction  story  everything  simply everything . i actually found myself laughing out loud at various points in the film . i particularly loved the bit where our hero is dashing through the hospital in soft focus slow motion  and knocks the clipboard out of the nurses hand  because  . . . . . . . . . . . . . well . just because . product placement  crucifix  s  crucifi   everywhere . if you are of a christian persuasion and very easily satisfied  you may like this movie . if you do like this movie  you really need to get out more .  ,0
sholay considered to be one of the greatest films . i always wondered if they would ever remake being the classic it is . that was the time rgv announced this movie and i was somewhat excited to see it . i always thought that maybe this will be a good movie  but every week we would here rgv change something . and the movie is a very b  grade movie  something that i had not hoped .  br    br   i really tried looking for positives  but i promised to keep sholay out of my mind . the cinematography is awesome . the movie tries to be its own . but that is the up side . the action sequences are weak . the screenplay had potential . the biggest flaw is editing . none of the scenes excite you . for example  the comedy sequences felt very out of place and forced . ironic because comedy was just as entertaining in the original . and none of the characters are developed . and no scenes will linger until the end . and the ending was very disappointing .  br    br   the biggest question is acting . amitabh bachchan was good as gabbar singh  nothing great . it seemed as if they concentrated too much on his look  that the character only looks menacing  but you don  t get creeped out . mohanlal is barely in the movie  but he impresses in his few scenes . ajay devgan was decent . it wasn  t so much the performance  he gave it his all  it was the weak script . prashant raj is very confident  and has potential to make it far with better movies .  br    br   i had most expectations for sushmita sen  who was probably the best of the lot . she was expressive  but this still was not enough . nisha kothari surprised me . she seemed disinterested for the most part  but her emotional scene after her friend  s death was quite good . seems as if she needs to find a director who will help her talent  not her cute looks . but what disappointed me most was chemistry . ajay devgan and prashant raj didn  t look like friends . ajay  nisha were not a strong couple . no passion was to be found between sushmita and prashant . and amitabh and mohanlal did not the hateful passion they needed .  br    br   as for songs  they pretty much suck . urmila  s mehbooba was too overblown and i pretty much slept through it . it was however nicely danced . the holi number was enjoyable  but not memorable . same went for the other songs . for someone who looked forward to this movie  i was heavily disappointed . i had high hopes for rgv because of his jungle  but seems as if he lost his talent during the shooting of this movie . but hopefully he regains his talent for sarkar raj . but this movie is best forgotten . all the positives still do not make up for the boring movie it is .  ,0

i am ashamed to have this movie in my collection . the most redeeming factor to owning the dvd is the short film in the bonus features . my vote for this movie is a big fat zero . don  t misunderstand  i  m a horror girl . but i want some meat behind the story  not to mention i prefer the evil to happen to humans  not to be tricked in to watching  what seemed like forever  clips of animal snuff . acts of brutality interrupt achingly long silence and poor acting . if i was forced to make a comparison to another film  the only one that comes to mind is cannibal holocaust . bad  boring  pointless and a wholly uncomfortable watch .  ,0

it is hard to describe bug in words  it is one of those films that truly has to be seen to be understood . it follows a narrative that is more fluid and interesting than anything i have seen lately in a hollywood release . as its characters react to the chain of events in different ways  and as the events dictate different paths for the characters to follow  the audience is merely an observer . the almost proustian narrative flow of thought to thought  the very spontaneity in the script will have you glued to the screen  waiting anxiously to see how it all works out in the end . and as far as the thematic elements . . . there is a particular sequence in the film that goes from melancholy  to bright and beautiful  and then to tragic  all within the span of about a minute . and it works .  br    br   this movie is pure magic . it reminds one why independent film is perhaps the brightest star the film industry currently has . perhaps with more movies of bug  s quality  people will start to take notice .  ,1
if you seen rodney dangerfield  s previous movies and performances  you  ll recognise several of the jokes made in this odd piece of dreck . written like a sitcom  this movie fails to strike any sort of likeable chord throughout  from the self  help doctor played by the aways sexy  as  chopped liver molly shannon to the  i  m fat  and therefore funny  john linette . the  wives themselves are likeable enough  and if this had been done as a pilot for an action  adventure series  it might have worked . instead  it comes off like a male fantasy that  s trying hard not to be politically incorrect .  ,0
i must admit  when i read the description of the genre on netflix as  steamy romance  i was a little bit skeptical .  steamy   in a movie from       i was prepared for disappointment . and when i realized it was shot entirely in black  white  i knew my erotic hopes were dashed .  br    br   boy  was i wrong  not only does this film have all of the elements of a steamy romance   the discovery of first love  fear of the secret being found out  a sudden unexpected end   but at times this movie was downright erotic . you will soon forget that it is shot in black  white . the cinematography deserves every accolade it has received over the years . and the performances from the two stars  essy persson and anna gael  are intense and memorable . ok  so they  re both in their mid twenties trying to play school girls . it  s     . do you really expect teenagers from the    s to be able to effectively explore a lesbian love story like this  many adult women were still trying to come to grips with their sexuality back then . anyone looking for real teens here is expecting too much .  br    br   i think this movie was way ahead of its time . the level of eroticism was an unexpected pleasure yet it still managed to leave a lot to the imagination  opting instead to give us poetic descriptions to add to what we were shown .  br    br   i have no doubt lesbians will identify with the characters here . as for you straight guys who love watching lesbians in action although it won  t be all you expect  i don  t think you  ll be too  too disappointed .  ,1
please  someone stop ben stiller from acting in any movie . write the studios  hell  write your local congressman even . i  ve gotten more laughs going to a funeral then i have watching any stiller flick . jack black tries to make something about a comedy about disappearing dog crap  and christopher walken  perhaps on of the greatest actors of his generation  simply looks embarrassed to be there . stiller is his unfunny self  but now even with someone to bail him out  proves that he is way overrated as a comic . it  s no wonder why this movie tanked badly  and was available of the dollar movie theaters after only a handful of weeks . i warn you  and you must warn your friends  do not watch this flick  it is just awful  worst then gothika  personally  i  d never thought i  d say that   worst the plan   worst the ishtar  worst then the golden child . please hollywood  quit allowing ben stiller in your movies  he  s not funny  he  s a god awful actor  and he  s bringing others down with him . the following film was ranked  because there are no negative scores allowed  so while the board says one  i  ll give it a zero .  ,0
i was in second grade    years ago . i remember it clearly . we were learning about space . all little kids want to go to space  right  well  after i saw this  i was so scared to death that i would  accidentally  get flung into space by some psychotic robot with a one track mind . i had no idea that this was a movie . i thought it was some news program or something . i guess it was my own version of when people were freaked out by the radio program  war of the worlds .  so  recently  i get this movie again to watch  realizing my favorite actor  joaquin phoenix was in it  then known as leaf phoenix  . i can tell you  i was laughing at the dramatic parts and laughing even harder at the acting . i mean  when andy is in space  she moves in slow motion  did you ever notice that  i don  t think being in space makes you talk that slow or think that slow .  br    br   the best part is when andy is knocked unconscious by the oxygen tank  and begins to float backwards as the security doors close . little max is trying to pull her in . suddenly  we get a major close up on max  s face as he shouts  in slow motion   whaaaaatttt  ssss happpeniiiinngggg       i had no idea .  ,0
this film reminds me a lot of the anti  drug films of the    s and    s due to the fact that it was made by people that have obviously never experienced the social evil that they are warning us about . tom hanks and his buddies are  role playing   but there are no dice  lots of candles  and then you are just swept away in a bad montage showing hanks falling for the lady in the group . quite funny but misguided . i wonder how many poor kids had their dd stuff destroyed  and were told that the use of their imagination was the road to destruction . as a film it  s basically an after school special  bad acting  although hanks does show some of his talent  and relationship talks  and no one seems to be having any fun . it seems these films have a psychological focus on adolescents starting on the road to adultism  which is more serious  apparently  and requires you to buckle down and do the things everyone else does . despite my vote of   this is worth watching due to its unique genre  scare films  which i personally find quite funny .  ,0
this motion picture comes straight out of the dark dungeon of full moon entertainment . this production company gained fame and fortune during the first half of the    s by producing terribly bad and cheesy horror movies . the most famous disasters in their ouvre are  subspecies    seedpeople  and  trancers  . none of these are recommended and neither is doctor mordrid  actually . hyperactive director charles band did come to the right company for his film . doctor mordrid is amazingly dumb and cheesy and almost completely humourless . i only saw it because it stars jeffrey combs . i learned that it can have several disadvantages if you  re a fan of him . for every good movie  it seems like he has made  inferior ones . anyways  the story is about the battle between  ancient sorcerers . one good one who  s here since    years to protect the humans  jeffrey as dr . mordrid  and one wicked one called kabal . he wants to destroy every form of human life for some reason i already forgot . combs gets his instructions from mentor . that  guy  only exists of a pair of eyes in space . very very cheesy  that is  every once and a while a blinding lightflash is shown on the screen but that  s about the only form of special effects this movie has got . the whole thing is just a piece of whining and nagging and when the two wizards finally face each other  it  s over before you know it . . . i would have expected for the wicked wizard to at least fight back a little  but nooooooo . . . . in some scenes  you really can detect some originality and creativity  like for example jeffrey  s lecture about the influence of the moon on criminals  and if you really pay attention  you might even find some very small but nice aspects  like the raven which is called edgar allen  but overall  it  s a terrible waste of time and energy . i  m a big fan of jeffrey and maybe he is a superhero in my eyes . . . but he sure doesn  t have to put on a stupid maillot for that .  ,0
some war movies succeed where others do not  and that can be judged from a variety of angles . the humanistic angle  one where you can feel the raw emotions  the terror of being under attack  the camaraderie amongst soldiers  the arduous trials people face inside them when in combat  etc . .  are always movies i find compelling . movies like das boot and a midnight clear are but two examples of movies that you sense a connection to the characters in the film .  br    br   this film succeeds on that level as well . it speaks of  the highest honor  and that honor is doing the right thing . these   soldiers did the right thing  they had honor and it is recognized in a way wholly incompatible with western thought  but it is  to the very end  a true story of honor . unforgettable movie . based on the true story .  ,1
it  s hard to say what was the worst thing about this show the bad acting  poor acoustics of different portions  bad cgi  improper sets for the period  the poor script . it would have been nice if the script followed the original tale a bit closer   there  s enough tension and good material in beowulf to provide a great deal of good material  and a better story line  than the scriptwriters could come up with .  br    br   and why introduce a strange new weapon like a crossbow that fires explosive bolts   br    br   i see that this movie was made in  only    days . it shows in the lack of quality . i  m beginning to think this is general  poor  attitude taken by sci  fi channel  and others  when it comes to making movies out of classic tales in the past few years .  br    br   what a waste   ,0
i had my doubts about another love story wherein disabled individuals find meaning and redemption through honest communication . and it  s still not at the top of my list . but the performances from helena bonham carter and kenneth branagh and exemplary  almost stunning  and rescue this from being just another tear  jerker . carter  s depiction of an als victim is strong  perhaps even overdone at times  sometimes her dialog dissolves into undistinguishable mutterings  . but the overall effect is commendable and rewarding . branagh may be the perfect compliment to her performance .  br    br    ,1
this tiresome  plodding las vegas casino heist movie in almost impossible to watch and get involved in . it  s something you  look at  if you have absolutely nothing else better to do . the only two decent things in this movie are both attached to gorgeous stella stevens and one spends the entire program hoping she  ll fall out of one of those skimpy tops she wears . many great shots of mid    s las vegas  when it was still a cool place to visit  and the fashions of the day are good for a giggle as well . otherwise  one big yawn . the rhino dvd has a very good widescreen transfer but even at under   bucks it still ain  t worth it in my humble opinion .  ,0
this film takes you inside itself in the early minutes and holds you till the end . it has a very humane story and very good selected music . the acting of moritz bleibtreu  giancarlo amato  and barnaby metschurat  gigi amato  is satisfying . recommended to people who get bored of action films and want to see a good movie .  ,1
it  s a very nice movie and i would definitely recommend it to everyone . but there are  minus points  the level of the stories has a large spectrum . some of the scenes are very great and some are just boring .  a lot of stories are not self  contained  if you compare to f . e . coffee and cigarettes  where each story has a point  a message  a punchline or however you wanna call it  but well  most stories are really good  some are great and overall it  s one of the best movies this year for sure   br    br   annoying  that i have to fill   lines at minimum  i haven  t got more to say and i don  t want to start analyzing the single sequences . . .  br    br   well  i think that  s it   ,1
i don  t like this film  but then i didn  t think much of the book either which  although lauded by many as a  masterpiece   i found lacking in character development and disjointed and illogical in plot  although it was far more readable than fante  s dreadful first effort  road to los angeles  not published until fante became fashionable in the mid   s .  br    br   i was intrigued to see what sort of soup towne would make with such meager ingredients . he has worked hard script  wise to repair the many shortcomings of the book but for my money didn  t rescue it . there was never a movie in ask the dust while ever he tried to stay faithful to the book . i consider this film towne  s folly .  br    br   in a word forgettable .  ,0
after watching this thing  then reading the summary on the back of the dvd  then thinking back to actual movie . . . . i became a bit dizzy . i thought  maybe i fell asleep and dreamed i was a down syndrome baby waltzing through a never ending forest where people drive   miles an hour and stop for no purpose other then occasional tasteless lesbianism . where  zombies   come out of nowhere and  vampires   who  seduce   pure hearted citizens on their way to save the world . neither zombie nor vampire notably encounter each other . the only fighting i remember was getting that walrus bonny giroux  s panties off . coo coo ca fat  all of them  maybe that was because we were watching it widescreen stretched and were too lazy to change it to its native resolution  but that actually made it more entertaining . . . in conclusion my trailing thought thesis had more continuity  plot  character development  antagonism  subject matter  and acting then the entirety of this film . it made bloodrayne look like citizen fing kane  ,0
not as bad a film as i thought it would be .  br    br   it has a good cast . nice to see roger moore back on screen as well as the use of other british actors .  br    br   would like to see more of olivia dabo in future projects . maybe starring opposite her cousin the sexy maryam dabo .  br    br   also a good use of unseen locations such as luxembourg .  br    br   hopefully we will see more uk  european co  productions like this .  ,1
i  m a big fan of b   having caught on only at the end of season three . i faithfully watched all the previous seasons when it was syndicated  concluding that it was one of the most well  thought out story arcs to ever hit television . even the filler episodes were interesting . the movies  also  were well produced and as entertaining as anything to hit the theaters .  br    br   which brings us to  river of souls  . naturally  after seeing everything else  i had high expectations . martin sheen appears to be acting in an ed wood movie rather than a serious sci  fi story . the story itself  might have looked good in outline form  even made it to the story board . however  it suffers obviously when it came time to filling this notion out into a two hour movie . there are no special effects to keep us entertained in the total absence of a compelling story . there are places where they were obviously short of time and just improvised the dialog to fill the story out . had this made the regular season  it would have rated among the worst of the episodes .  ,0
i  ve long wanted to see this film  being a fan of both peter cushing and david mccallum . i agree that the romantic sub  plot was a waste of time  but the talent of mccallum shines through this juvie role . thank heavens for turner classic which aired the show last week . i can imagine that there were lots of problems with children after the war  especially with the way things were throughout the     s . some of the boys are a bit scary . i certainly wouldn  t want to met them on a well  lit street  much less a dark one . there were some good insights regarding the feelings of a firebug as well  or as they call him  a firefly .  ,1
i dont know why people think this is such a bad movie . its got a pretty good plot  some good action  and the change of location for harry does not hurt either . sure some of its offensive and gratuitous but this is not the only movie like that . eastwood is in good form as dirty harry  and i liked pat hingle in this movie as the small town cop . if you liked dirty harry  then you should see this one  its a lot better than the dead pool .     ,1
ridiculous . this movie is actually a vehicle for the ramtha school of enlightenment . if you are wondering who the bleep ramtha is  ramtha is a       year  old spirit  warrior who appeared in j . z . knight  s kitchen in tacoma  washington in     . knight claims that she is ramtha  s channel . she also owns the copyright to ramtha and conducts sessions in which she pretends to go into a trance and speaks hollywood  s version of elizabethan english in a guttural  husky voice . she has thousands of followers and has made millions of dollars performing as ramtha at seminars        a crack  and at her ramtha school of enlightenment  and from the sales of tapes  books  and accessories  clark and gallo      . she must have hypnotic powers . searching for self  fulfillment  otherwise normal people obey her command to spend hours blindfolded in a cold  muddy  doorless maze .  john wheeler  one of america  s finest theoretical physicists  would roll his eyes about this movie . he has in the recent past criticized parapsychologists for their misuse and misinterpretations of quantum theory . this movie does the same thing as those fools .  br    br   there is a great review of this movie at skeptico . i recommend anyone considering watching this movie read it first before contributing to a cult  s coffers .  br    br   http   skeptico . blogs . com  skeptico          what  the  bleep  . html i noticed one reviewer here at imdb say to take this movie with a grain of salt . it will take enough salt to kill a horse to wade through the garbage  thinking of this movie .  ,0
there are two kinds of characters on the shield people who try to do the best they can and do the right thing  and people who relentlessly pursue their own self interest and commit every mortal sin they can while telling themselves and everyone else that they are heroes  and everyone  s only hope . more than any other show  the shield is about hypocrisy and self  delusion . unfortunately  the hypocrites and self  deluders are the shows heroes  and as such have the typical genre  fiction heroes  improbable immunity to getting defeated or caught and they come out on top over and over again  making fools out of all of their peers .  br    br   the show boasts excellent camera  work . the lead ins and the fade outs are always superb . it really is a work of art to see . unfortunately the story is a cartoony  overwrought wish fulfillment scenario of gratuitous violence  rape  and lies .  br    br   the hero  who drags everyone down with him in failed scheme after failed scheme  is wiley like a warner bros cartoon character  always escaping and making fun of all the elmer fudds  anyone who does not support him in his lies and crimes   automatically attracting any good looking woman supporting character to come on the show  always surviving any attempt to bring him to justice  and always scraping your ears with his excruciating self justifications . if another cop detects something wrong with something he  s doing  and someone gets hurt because of his actions  he always blames the suspicious cop  regardless of the fact that his schemes and elaborate lies and doomed plans are always the cause . every time .  br    br   like    this show relies on contrivances and innumerable delays to drag its story out for season after season . boring  unbelievable long term stories are injected into the storyline every season to provide a skeleton on which to hang the bloody  perverted chunks of meat that are the characters  corrupt acts and the inevitable cover  ups .  br    br   most disappointing though  is the writers  hubris as they try to change the viewers  sympathies back and forth  to and away form the characters on whims . sometimes  they want us to see shane as the enemy . sometimes they want us to see him as a poor misunderstood soul . sometimes they want us to see vic as a dangerous  sexual dynamo . sometimes they want us to see him as a poor guy with a heart of gold . sometimes they want us to see mara as a low down vile jezebel . then they think that if they show her sitting and talking over her dreams with shane  that we will find her to be sympathetic and tragic .  br    br   none of this manipulation is adequate to obtain the kinds of sympathies they want . once they  ve shown these characters ruin other people  s lives for their own ends  that  s it . it is nonsense to keep trying to flip back and forth . but then  it is also nonsense to produce seven seasons of these bumbling clowns drawing every super model in existence to their beds and running a crime syndicate right out of the police station  right under everyone  s noses .  ,0
i think this film has been somewhat overrated here . there are some things to admire in it for one thing it deserves credit for being a science fiction  ish  film which relies on its story instead of special effects and action sequences to carry the day . the supporting cast is good  the set design and cinematography are good  and the ideas are interesting enough  though they are beginning to seem a little tired after the many mediocre dark city  memento  fight club clones of recent years  . but the film is undone by poor characterization  wooden performances from the lead actors  and a laughably bad ending .  br    br   the main problem i had was that the protagonist was neither likable nor unlikable . i realize that part of the story dictates that he should be a bit of a  wait for it . . .  cipher  but i was utterly unable to work up any empathy for a character that just seemed like a boring  anonymous schlub of a man . what character transformation there is for this sad sack is artificially forced on him by the plot . lead actor jeremy northam succeeds in conveying that the protagonist is confused and hapless  but fails at inspiring any sympathy for him . opposite him  lucy liu does what she can with a character who has no real personality of her own  unless being the embodiment of a spy  movie clich counts as personality .  br    br   one of the biggest disappointments of this movie is the ending . i won  t give any spoilers here  but i will say that a surprise twist at the end was telegraphed pretty clearly at least   minutes before it occurred . further  after being content to be a quirky  idea  oriented movie for the first hour or so  the last few scenes suddenly and terribly devolve into the worst kind of hollywood pap  complete with big explosions and special effects . the revealing of the film  s mcguffin at the end is poorly done  and at the end the characters seem even less likable than they did before some of the film  s main plot threads were resolved .  br    br   the movie  s not all bad  though . it does manage to maintain a certain low level of tension throughout most of it  despite the slow pacing  although i think i have a higher than average tolerance for slow  paced movies  . and there are some moments when the unsettled  paranoiac feeling that director vincenzo natali was clearly trying to evoke rises to the surface . but in the end  these elements aren  t enough to overcome the flaws in the film  s acting and script . there is probably a good movie that covers these same themes and ideas  but this isn  t it .  ,0
but  cinderella  gets my vote  not only for the worst of disney  s princess movies  but for the worst movie the company made during walt  s lifetime . the music is genuinely pretty  and the story deserves to be called  classic .  what fails in this movie are the characters  particularly the title character  who could only be called  the heroine  in the loosest sense of the term .  br    br   after a brief prologue  the audience is introduced to cinderella . she is waking up in the morning and singing  a dream is a wish your heart makes .  this establishes her as an idealist  and thus deserving of our sympathy  . unfortunately  the script gives us no clue as to what she is dreaming about . freedom from her servant role  the respect of her step  family  someone to talk to besides mice and birds  in one song  cut from the movie but presented in the special features section of the latest dvd  cinderella relates her wish that there could be many of her so she could do her work more efficiently . you go girlfriend  in short  cinderella is a very bland character . she passively accepts her step  family  s abuse  escaping into her unspoken dreams for relief . she only asserts herself once by reminding her stepmother that she is still a member of the family . for this  she is given permission to go the ball if she completes her housework and finds something to wear  a token gesture that is clearly absurd to everyone except  of course  cinderella . can anyone see belle or jasmine being such a doormat  if cinderella is dull  her male counterpart is nothing short of lifeless . the prince in cinderella gets no dialog and almost no screen time . we are given no indication if he is a good man  if he respects cinderella or anything . all we know is   he is a prince and   he dances well . heck  even the prince from  snow white  got to sing a romantic song at least . not only does this lack of development make the romance less interesting  it makes cinderella look like either a social climber or an idiot  weakening her already tenuous appeal .  br    br   perhaps realizing how dull the main characters were  the animators chose to give excessive screen time to the movie  s comic relief  cinderella  s friends  the mice . granted  these characters are amusing . even so  when the comic relief steals the show from the principals  well  let  s just say your story has some problems .  br    br   dinsey loves to proclaim all its animated features as  masterpieces .  while many of them are  there are some that do not deserve this appellate in any way . cinderella is a prime example of this fact .  ,0
foywonder  s review of this cheap stv hits the nail squarely on the head . make sure you read it . in case you don  t  a group of scientists heads off into the deep woods of the pacific northwest  to fumble around with a bunch of bones in an animal graveyard . the big foot family doesn  t take kindly to this  and proceeds to pick off the team one by one  largely offscreen . big foot himself has a distinctly ape  like face  but is less scary overall than harry from harry and the hendersons . most of the movie has the wooden  generic actors pretending to be scientists tromping around in the woods and yakking away . this is a no  budget movie in which very little happens  at least on screen . we do get to watch the sexiest of the females take a shower while one of her male companions watches  but nothing comes of this .  ,0
i wouldn  t say this totally sucked  but if it wasn  t for netflix i wouldn  t even have this in my house . steve martin  s eccentric president of a chain of health food stores falls flat . he  s just not funny . he  s another in a long slew of snl rejects that can only find work whoring themselves to the next snl movie . the birthing coach with the elmer fudd lisp is about as funny as it is original . amy poehler simply goes through the same motions she would for a  minute snl skit which is about as funny as snl lately . the only thing going for this movie is that tina fey is easy on the eyes . the ending was predictable as soon as you heard her character couldn  t get pregnant . the subject matter could have opened up to other comedic attempts  but it seems to simple simmer along  not really entertaining or creating laughs .  ,0
actress ruth roman  s real  life philanthropic gesture to help entertain troops arriving from and leaving for the korean war at an air base near san francisco jump  started this all  star warner bros . salute to patriotism and song . many celebrities make guest appearances while a love  hate romance develops between a budding starlet and a painfully green and skinny air force corporal  ron hagerthy  who looks like he should be delivering newspapers from his bicycle  . seems the corporal has fooled the actress into thinking he  s off to battle when actually he  s part of a airplane carrier crew  flying to and from honolulu  you  d think she  d be happy he was staying out of harm  s way  but instead she acts just like most childish females in     s movies  . doris day is around for the first thirty minutes or so  and her distinct laugh and plucky song numbers are most pleasant . roman is also here  looking glamorous  while james cagney pokes fun at his screen persona and gordon macrae sings in his handsome baritone . jane wyman sings  too  in a hospital bedside reprise following doris day  s lead  causing one to wonder   did they run out of sets   for undemanding viewers  an interesting flashback to another time and place . still  the low  rent production and just  adequate technical aspects render  starlift  strictly a second  biller .     from   ,0
very strange but occasionally elegant exploitation movie with no real story  but benefiting from its stunningly ravishing lead actress and a handful of nice  gruesome make  up effects . daniella is a beautiful twenty  something girl  carrying with her the trauma of being raped at the age of   . nightmares and hallucinations lead her further into believing she  s the reincarnation of a female ancestor who was said to be a werewolf . she kills her brother  in  law during a nightly encounter and gets submitted in a hospital . she escapes again  however  and randomly devours more men whilst on the run for police detectives  doctors and relatives . it  s all pretty to look at and listen too  really great soundtrack   but the absence of plot and continuity become irritating quite fast . luckily enough  leading lady annik borel rarely ever wears clothes and she fills up the boring moments by dancing naked around a fire . the film is too long  too weird and too forgettable . the biggest surprise comes at the end  when suddenly and out of the blue  director rino di silvestro tries to make us believe that his movie was based on true facts . yeah  right . . .  ,0
sorry guys  i  ve already written my opinion of this movie but today was the first day i looked at some of the other reviews . there are a quite a lot of people who agree with me but what  s scary is that there are some people who seem to really like this movie . i don  t like to write nasty reviews or criticise other people  s opinions but i think it  s only fair to warn anybody out there who may be debating whether or not to see this movie . this is not a good movie . i really like movies and i  ll watch just about anything but this movie made it onto the incredibly short list of movies i watched and was happy to leave halfway through . if you really are incredibly tempted  watch the trailer . . . that  s the mistake i made because the entire movie is essentially in the trailer . . . after that there are no surprises  just some shockingly bad dialogue to waste time . i love michael vartan in alias and would hate to criticise him but i think it  s my duty to stop other people wasting hours of their life on a movie like this    ,0
kudos to the writers of this film for creating a supremely engaging drama . the curious character development is indicative of a nuanced and well schooled writing team . the audience member cannot but help but to feel that  s  he must make wrenching emotional decisions pitting the cerebral against the libidinal . the viewer has an opportunity to develop the character herself  though her predictions are rarely validated .  br    br   credit is also due to the filmmakers for breathing life into the setting . the wood  shop is transformed into a unique persona as the film unfolds  with its own traits  faults  a variety of highly charged relationships  and of course a fate inexorably tied to that of the other principals .  br    br   make sure to catch this one at your local art  house .  ,1
i noticed at once that this movie really wasn  t based on dodie smith  s novel . in any case  it was a nice idea that pongo and perdita  s son now had his own puppies . the cutest of the dalmatians was  of course  little snowball who was completely spotless till the very end of the film .  br    br   to be honest  i didn  t know what to think when cruella de vil seemed to have changed completely kind . in fact i have often thought about the possibility that she could become friendly  but now that she so quickly changed into  herself  again and announced that she was cruella once more  i almost began to be really worried about chloe  s dalmatians .  br    br   actually  the scene in which the puppies watched lady and the tramp while chloe and kevin had their dinner  was much better than i had expected . i also was fond of the parrot who played to be a dog  and it was incredible that the dogs had learned so many tricks for this movie .  br    br   of course i was content that at the end the dalmatians were saved again  but i would have liked to know what was going to happen to cruella after she had lost her whole property . and what on earth could the dogs  home do with such a huge sum of money   br    br   finally  it was quite touching that snowball also had spots at the very end of the film .  ,1
this movie has great fight scenes . now its true that the acting is a little rough . but if i wanted to see a movie based on acting skills i would watch a cheesy movie like american beauty . but if you want to see a movie with true martial arts in it and with amazing stunts without the use of wires and flying threw the air like so many movies around now which are over killing the matrix . then watch this . now it  s true the two main stars in the show where in the kid show the power rangers and another cast member of that show has a bit part in this movie . but hey the fight scenes are enough to make jet li ps his pants . and the stunts are worthy enough for jackie chan to sit threw and admire .  ,1
this film is massively boring and pretentious . there is only one good moment when a sailor shaves mr barney  s  think the purple dinosaur  less pretense  eyebrow . the music is relentlessly cloying  it is sad that bjork  someone with so much inner beauty  has been brought down to pretentious falsity in her art . the pomp of the tea service makes a beautiful ritual seem vapid . the mythology and culture are not respected in this film they are lifted . not just from japanese culture but from another filmmaker . . .  stay tuned  in a perfect  art imitates life  moment  the crew of the ship finds a giant piece of sht . which is what the audience found in the theatre . there are some set pieces which are very composed and arty without heart    thenprepare for spoilers  i  m talking to you mr barney .  br    br   the emperor has no clothes  mr . barney you have been outted  i have seen jodorowsky  s holy mountain . and your thin  fake veil of bs has been lifted . you have stolen your images your style and your entire art catalogue from this man . now that holy mountain has been released finally let  s hope the powers that be at the art councils of the world stop financing you  poor jodorowsky  lost in a financial battle with the beatles lawyer when he is the lennon  mccartney of film  making . and btw while jodorowsky is the beatle  you are the monkees  a cheap thin soulless rip off only liked by facile kitschy college freshmen . and btw i am a filmmaker . if you are interested in making a reality film  i will legally fight you in a ring defending jodorowsky  you  defending outright thievery .  ,0
i just watched this movie on starz . let me go through a few things i thought could have been improved the acting  writing  directing  special effects  camera crew  sound  and lighting . it also seemed as though the writers had no idea anything that had to do with the movie . apparently back in      when the dollar was stronger you could buy a super advanced stealth bomber that could go completely invisible for    million . now  a  days those things cost about   billion and they cant go invisible . apparently you can fly from the us to the middle east in an hour . there was a completely random lesbian scene  which i didn  t mind  but it seemed like a lame attempt to get more guys to see it . the camera would randomly zoom in on actors and skip to random scenes . oh yeah  since its a steven segal movie  its predictable as hell . all in all i rank it right up there with snakes on a plane .  ,0
we bought this film from a shop called poundland . we were looking for more inspiration as we have previously bought the film no big deal an remade it .  br    br   we expected this film to be badly inspirational so that we might remake it and put it on the tube . however  this was shocking . boring is the main word that comes to mind . the bad effects and script aren  t enough to make you watch it . the main woman  s body seems to be whipped out at opportune moments in a pathetic attempt to keep the viewer interested . however  it just makes you wonder  did they blow the budget getting her to take her clothes off  if so  i  d have asked for a refund  it looks like a homemade film  the shots don  t even correspond with each other and the camera work is so amateur it makes our remakes of bad movies look professional . i cannot believe that this is being sold as a marketable product .  br    br   it is just boring and ugly to watch . the actors are bad and there is no degree of professionalism about it . there are no words to describe how terrible it is .  ,0
in keeping with disney  s well  known practice of stealing . . i mean . . buying out known properties and bastardizing them  this live  action version of the venerable cartoon classic has got to be one of the worst re  makes in a year of bad re  makes . i grew up on the original cartoon tv series . any episode of the original cartoon series will give you more laughs than this entire movie . not present is penny  s cool computer book . also not present is the gag with the self  destructing orders that always ends up detonating on the chief . new are a smooth talking gadget convertible  the original cartoon had a cooler vehicle that could turn into a van or a car  and an element of a typical  unrealistic hollywood romance . don  t fill the coffers to pay for disney executives and even their  ex  executives  don  t see this movie .  br    br    ,0
same old same old about che . it completely ignored the really interesting facts of che  s true character . sodeberg redid the same boring narrative of che . the silly seductive tale of an argentinean rich  boy who was so shocked by poverty he became a robin hood fighting alongside the poor  until eventually he was murdered by the cia . yeah  yeah  heard it all before  boring and untrue  . the reality of che guevara is very different and far more explosive  the facts show that he was a totalitarian with a messiah streak  who openly wanted to impose maoist tyranny on the world . he was so fanatical that at the hottest moment in the cold war  he even begged the soviet union to nuke new york  washington or los angeles and bring about the end of the world . che urged khrushchev to launch a nuclear strike against us cities . for the rest of his life  he declared that if his finger had been on the button  he would have pushed it . when khrushchev backed down and literally saved the world  che was furious at the  betrayal  . if che  s recommendations had been followed  you would not be reading this review now . how a homicidal maniac became a pop icon would have made a much more interesting film . incredible that no filmmaker has been daring enough to show the real side of che and his posthumous media transformation . that would make an oscar winning film  i thought making independent film meant taking real risks and being groundbraking  they only stick to  safe counterculture themes   to wit   che cool    wall street bad    republican nazi    bush ex hitler    nra is worse than kgb    christians are fanatics and stupid   etc . . . ad nauseum . oooh  how daring  how mind blowing . tres anti  mainstream and edgy . i wish they would have some real cojones and tackle the independent film oligarchy  that would be truly daring   ,0
if this is supposed to be a portrayal of the american serial killer  it comes across as decidedly average .  br    br   a journalist duchovny travels across country to california to document america  s most famous murderers  unaware that one of his white trailer trash travelling companions pitt is a serial killer himself .  br    br   rather predictable throughout  this has its moments of action and pitt and lewis portray their roles well  but i  d not bother to see it again .  ,1
okay  let  s face it . this is a god  awful movie . the plot  such as it is  is horrible  the acting worse . but the movie was made for one reason and one reason only  like all of those awful mario lanza movies . . . just to hear the voice of the star  in this case pavarotti in his prime . okay  so maybe the lanza movies were also an excuse for him to hit on women  but this movie is about hearing luciano . that alone is worth watching the movie . a big opera star stuck on himself faces his fears  finds humility and love along the way  and belts out a lot of hit numbers  too .  br    br   i must admit i  m prejudiced on a number of levels . i  m italian . i  m a big pavarotti fan  is there anything about pavarotti that isn  t big  including his fan base   . and when i first saw this movie i was going out on my own  seeing the height and depth of life  s possibilities and in love for the first time . so as awful as this movie is  the beautiful voice and memories are enough to make me breathe deep of life and love again .  br    br   yes  it  s corny and awful . but the voice is immortal and timeless  and the voice is what it  s all about . so i give this movie a high rating in hopes that someone who has never heard pavarotti before will listen and watch and enjoy a new level of music and love  especially since he is now gone . like italian food that you  ve never tried before  try it  you may be pleasantly surprised  as a luciano lover or prospective pavarotti peep .  ,1
spoilers and extreme bashing lay ahead  br    br   when this show first started  i found it tolerable and fun . fairly oddparents was the kind of cartoon that kids and adults liked . it also had high ratings along with spongebob . but it started to fall because of the following crap that butch hartman and his team shoved into the show .  br    br   first off  toilet humor isn  t all that funny . you can easily pull off a fast laugh from a little kiddie with a burp  but that  s pretty much the only audience that would laugh at such a clich joke . next there are the kiddie jokes . lol we can see people in their underwear and we can see people cross  dressing . lololol    i just can  t stop laughing at such gay bliss  somebody help me  but of course  this show wouldn  t suck that bad if it weren  t for stereotypes . did you see how the team portrayed australians  they saw them as nothing but kangaroo  loving  boomerang  throwing simpletons who live in a hot desert . but now . . . is the coup de grace of why this show truly sucks the loudest of them all . . . over  used jokes    the show constantly pulls up the same jokes  the majority of them being unfunny  thinking it is like the greatest thing ever  cosmo is mostly the one to blame . i hated how they kept on mentioning  super toilet   which also has a blend of kiddish humor in it just as well  and cosmo would freak out . and who could forget that dumb battery ram joke that every goddamn parent in dimmsdale would use in that one e  mail episode  you know  the one in which every single parent  oblivious to other parents saying it  would utter the exact same sentence before breaking into their kid  s room  yes  it may be first class humor to some people  but it is pure s to others .  br    br   if i  m not mistaken  i do believe butch hartman said something about ending the show . thank god  everyone around my area says it  s  like  the funniest nickelodeon show ever . i just can  t agree with it i think it  s just another pile of horse dung that we get on our cartoon stations everyday  only worse .  ,0
if i had not read pat barker  s  union street  before seeing this film  i would have liked it . unfortuntately this is not the case . it is actually my kind of film  it is well made  and in no way do i want to say otherwise  but as an adaptation  it fails from every angle .  br    br   the harrowing novel about the reality of living in a northern england working  class area grabbed hold of my heartstrings and refused to let go for weeks after i had finished . i was put through tears  repulsion  shock  anger  sympathy and misery when reading about the women of union street . excellent . a novel that at times i felt i could not read any more of  but i novel i simply couldn  t put down . depressing yes  but utterly gripping .  br    br   the film . oh dear . hollywood took barker  s truth and reality  and showered a layer of sweet icing sugar over the top of it . a beautiful film  an inspiring soundtrack  excellent performances  a tale of hope and romance . . . yes . an adaptation of  union street  . . . no .  br    br   the women of union street and their stories are condensed into fonda  s character  their stories are touched on  but many are discarded . i accept that some of barker  s tales are sensitive issues and are too horrific for mass viewing  and that a film with around  leading protagonists just isn  t practical  but the content is not my main issue . the essence and the real gut of the novel is lost  darkness and rain  broken windows covered with cardboard  and the graphically described stench of poverty is replaced with sunshine  pretty houses  and a twinkling william  s score .  br    br   if you enjoyed the film for its positivity and hope in the face of  reality   i advise that you hesitate to read the book without first preparing yourself for something more like  schindler  s list  . . . but without the happy ending .  ,0

what a shame it is when a potentially captivating and refreshingly low  key story manages to latch onto your interest at the start and then gradually lets you down further and further until you  re left scratching your mystified head by the time it reaches its overdone conclusion . unfortunately  this is what happened to me by the end of white noise .  br    br   it wasn  t michael keaton  s fault it was a pleasure to see him return as the star of a brand new movie once again  looking a bit wrinkled perhaps  but still managing to give a strong and sincere performance . as a man whose wife has recently died  he becomes obsessed with her wandering spirit in the afterlife  not a new idea   apparently getting contacted by her through that funky electrical fuzz business you see on your television screen when there  s nothing being broadcast .  br    br   the idea of spirits communicating via the airwaves is called evp  electronic voice phenomena  and there are a lot of people who actually believe in it for real  so i  m not going to make any comments about what i think of that  or them . let me just say that i  m all for suspension of disbelief when it comes to buying into fantastic films like this  but what i can  t tolerate is not understanding what the hell was supposed to be taking place  which is about where i was left stranded when the credits finally began to roll . much static indeed .  br    br   there are occasionally movies like this that have me completely baffled  but if a film fails to make itself clear for me  i tend to consider that to be the fault of the filmmaker  not my own  unless i watched it while i was too tired to focus or something  . well  for white noise i was wide awake  bright  eyed and bushy  tailed   so guess who  s to blame   ,0
  br    br   an old man works as a janitor in a mental hospital to be close to his wife who is a patient there and to try to get her out .  br    br   this is surely one of the most forgotten masterpieces of the silent era and an oddity in the history of japanese cinema . long thought lost  a print was found in the   s and a music soundtrack added to it  which fits perfectly with the images . it might have been influenced by cabinet of doctor caligary  director kinugasa claimed he never saw the german film  . however it surpasses it in style and in its more convincing  and chilly  portray of the inner mental state of the inmates in the asylum . to achieve this  the film makes use of every single film technique available at the time multiple exposures and out of focus subjective point of view  tilted camera angles  fast and slow motion  expressionist lighting and superimpositions among others . it is also a very complicated film to follow  as it has not got intertitles .  br    br   the film opens with a montage of shots of rain hitting the windows of the hospital  wind shaking trees and of thunder . the unsettling weather metaphors the mental condition of the patients and introduces one of the them a former dancer . the combination of sounds produced by rain  wind and thunder serves as the music that incites the dancer to get into a frantic  almost hypnotic dance . in another sequence involving the same patient engaged in another frenzied dance  she is being watched by other inmates . multiple exposures of the dancer represent the patients  point of view and their confused  view  of the world .  br    br   these are just two examples from this amazing film trying to represent the patients  subconscious and view of the  sane  world .  br    br   in three words a must see .  ,1
this documentary has been aired on both rte and bbc in the last number of months . having seen it twice now i would recommend it to anyone with an interest in media and documentary film making .  br    br   initially this documentary was meant to detail the political life of venezuelan president hugo chavez . the irish crew set off with those intentions . what happens when they get to venezuela is startling as they witness first hand the attempted overthrow by rebel factions  particularly the oil concerns in venezuela  of chavez and his government . what we the audience witness is just how the media manipulates the situation and in effect backs the overthrow of chavez by distorting events that transpire as the coup heightens .  br    br   it really is an excellent documentary and a remarkable piece of work by a couple of novice filmmakers .  br    br    ,1
the premise is amazing and the some of the acting  notably sally kellerman and anthony rapp  is charming . . . but this film is near unwatchable . the music sounds as if it comes from some sort of the royalty free online site and the lyrics as if they were written with a rhyming dictionary open on the lap . most of the singing is off  key . i think they may have filmed with the singing accapella and put in the music under it . . . the dialogue is really stupid and trite . the movie works best when it is actually talking about the real estate but unfortunately it strays to often into stupid farcical sub  plots . i found myself checking my watch after ther first twenty minutes and after   wondering  when is it ever going to end .   ,0
this review may contain some spoilers .  br    br   the remake of the classic     car chase movie gone in   seconds begins well . actually it is well acted and the plot moves quite well . but even a big hollywood budget doesn  t change the fact that the original plot was more believable . for those who don  t know  the original plot had the thieves working as insurance inspectors . who would suspect them . but even with a change to nearly every aspect of h . b . halicki  s original  the remake is a very good movie  until we get to the final chase scene  the part of the   version that made it great . the one in this version is watered down  only   minutes  and it culminates in a monster special effect that takes all believability out of the chase . where the original chase was very believable  the star was a stunt driver who did all his own stunt  the remake falls flat in the last   minutes . my advice  if you want to watch a classic car chase film  fine the original in the bargain bin at your local rental joint and stay clear of the new remake .  ,0
to all of yall who think  . this was a boring telecast  . halle berry and denzel washington did not deserve their oscars  br    br   shut the fk up   this was one of the best academy awards show because  . it was a moment in history to have a black yes  black actress  win an academy award for best actress so many of our black sisters have been ignored by the academy for many years . to be honest i had stop watching the academy awards because of a lack of diversity in either the winners or nominees . to me it was nothing but a bunch of white people patting each other in the back . the academy had many chances to vote black actresses that were brilliant in movies eg alfre woodard  whoopi goldberg  diana ross  mary jean babtise  but it did not  . halle berry deserved that oscar no competition the academy was under pressure to vote for her so long have deserving actresses been ignored by the academy the majority of which is comprised of white voters yeah yeah nicole kidman sang very prettily in muling rouge  but it was time black people were accommodated in these awards shows . as for mr washington the academy owed him big time after that unfair loss for malcomx . to all of you who think race is not an issue  probably white people  in the movie industry  well it is many of the most talented black actresses around have either been reduced to stereo typical made by white people roles of what they think is a black women or are not existence  angela basset  . i do not expect many of the white people to understand any of this because they never had to deal with any of it . come to think of it they are the one who been inflicting it  ,1
a spoiler .  br    br   what three words can guarantee you a terrible film  cheap canadian production . the brain fits those words perfectly . terrible script  idiotic acting and hilarious special effects make this a must for every bad movie fan . the horror is hilarious . the post production team looks like it gave up . what makes the brain admirable is in the second half  it actually tries to be good  can a bit of ingenuity and consistency save what is already a joke   br    br   it  s around christmas time . a mother and daughter are murdered by one of the funniest looking villains ever . the day later  a rebel teen gets into enough trouble that he is sent for a psychiatric analysis .  br    br   if a cop  s head is chopped off and a stranger with blood on him and a bloody axe told you some kids did it  who would you believe  what begins as funny turns dull and tiring toward the end when the brain tries to be serious . a child cannot be frightened by the scary moments . the brain is too funny a concept to try and be gritty . the psychological research institute is larger than major manufacturing plants  our ugly villain and its cohorts get credit for pulling some of the worst acting i have seen . viewer discretion advised heavily .  ,0
watching the tenants has been a interesting experience for me . it is the first film i have ever seen where i have shuttled at speed through parts of the  non  action  and i can normally watch anything from turgid action movies to serbo  croat indie and find them fascinating .  br    br   the tenants is frustratingly sluggish and over  orchestrated . one of the main problems of the script is there is little realistic character dialogue  apart from the set pieces where characters  collide  in a very structured setting  to make this work  the film needed to feel more conceptual  which it didn  t  . this leads to a lack of realistic character development everyone seems two  dimensional .  br    br   the worse for this is the character of bill spear  aka snoop dogg . i found his characterization very uncomfortable and very unsympathetic . at one point  i even stopped the film because i got so annoyed by the character  s aggressive  violent and monotonal delivery  the lack of any other personality layer apart from that of the reactionary  on  switch  which gets really predictable after a while  and i so desperately wanted him to have some redeeming qualities . however  one reason for this jar might be the nebulous time scape of the film  supposedly   s  it feels and looks more early noughties  . if it had been more securely fixed in the   s  his character might have seemed more understandable .  br    br   the lighting of the film was also awkward . all the way through  the soundtrack attempts to provide a certain gritty  jazz  infused atmosphere that just did not come off  largely because the set was too well  lit .  br    br   the tenants  to me  is an unbelievable film . it doesn  t depict real people or propose any interesting ways of thinking about race  identity or the life of a writer  be they white or black .  br    br   strangely  i came away with the feeling that this project needed david lynch his eerie  clastrophobic and obsessive look and feel would have lifted both the actors and the script into something quite remarkable .  ,0
the plot of  astronuat returns to earth as a mutating monster  died out in the     s mainly down to the scientific fact that travelling outside the earth  s orbit doesn  t humans cause to turn in to mutated monsters  and that the first film to use this plot the quatermass experiment was the only decent sci  fi movie to use the idea . so the idea of having the redundant plot return seems doomed from the start . alas watching the incredible melting man it seems the plot is the least of its problems  br    br   first of all this is an incredibly badly made movie . the budget is in single figures and i  m talking about lira not dollars . there is no cinematography to speak of and there  s countless editing blunders . for example a photographer takes his  barely legal  model for a photo shoot . cut to a shot where the sun is directly behind model  then cut to shot of photographer where the sun is directly behind him  then cut back to the model where the sun is . . .  br    br   the lack of budget drags the film down in other aspects too . according to the trivia page the budget was so low the producers couldn  t get any stock footage of saturn so when astronaut steve west mentions how beautiful saturn looks we get footage of the sun . actually the sun gives the most impressive performance in the film since the human actors wouldn  t be employed by a porn studio . if i was appearing in this i wouldn  t be scared by the eponymous monster  i  d be terrified of splinters from the rest of the cast . perhaps we should be slightly forgiving though since the obvious lack of budget manifests itself in things like the actors having to wear their own clothes . a general for instance doesn  t wear his nice fancy dress uniform complete with medals  he wears a denim jacket and baseball cap  br    br   there has to be suspension of disbelief for a film like this to work but it fails on every level . the tone is set early on in the film where mr melty murders a nurse and escapes from the hospital . instead of the police getting a call saying there  s been a murder dr nelson just decides to track down his patient on his own own same as he  d look for a missing cat . it  s also strange a thoroughly decomposing homicidal monster can walk down the road without anyone noticing  but this is typical of a film where horny   year olds stop their car down dark roads for a quickie and people nonchalantly mention their wife is pregnant whilst forgetting to tell the police that there  s a monster on the loose .  br    br   the incredible melting man is z grade rubbish . i can certainly understand why people enjoy this movie because it does reach the heights of  it  s so bad it  s good  but apart from rick baker  s sometimes impressive make up effects it  s nothing more than a very guilty pleasure  ,0

i  ve always been a big cybill shepperd fan  ever since i saw her series a few years ago   this film certainly shows her in her best light yet   the film was so wonderfully cast and played   every now and again she drops little amusing lines  just to make this film one of the best i  ve ever seen   everybody really out does themselves   especially robert downey jr and cybill shepperd  they really made the film come true   also i loved the little bit where mavis loses her wig and she nearly dies when she falls to the floor   this is film at its best    ,1

possible spoilers .  br    br   although there was some good acting  particularly chloe sevigny  and radha mitchell in the comedy half  this simply was not an engaging film . the segues between the comedy part and the tragedy part were awkward or sometimes not obvious . this viewer was initially confused by the fact that the supporting cast differs in the two halves i thought with the way things were laid out in the opening scene that the people surrounding melinda would be the same people  just reacting differently  more of a  he said  she said  premise  . however  what we have is two totally different stories and two totally different women  both of whom happen to be played by radha mitchell .  br    br   the two playwrights in the opening scene  the comedian and the tragedian  supposedly take the same premise and go from there  but the two stories are only tenuously related . they do little to support the topic of discussion  which is that almost anything can be looked at as either comedy or tragedy . nice cast  but a disappointing film .  ,0
i wish more movies were two hours long . on the other hand  i wish more american civil war movies were merely two hours long .  gone with the wind    gettysburg   that  s about the length i  ve come to expect although those two at least entertained for however many hours they lasted and even  gettysburg  lasted as long as it did because things happened in the course of it .  br    br   by contrast ang lee  s film is bloated and uneventful . it actually feels as if it takes much less than two hours . that wasn  t a compliment . it  s really no different to any other form of sensory deprivation at the time it feels as though it will never end  afterwards it seems to have taken no time at all .  br    br   the film gets off on the wrong foot  as lee plays his interminable credits over the opening footage  bad mistake  in which we are introduced to some characters we take an instant dislike to and will later come to loathe . the central two are jake  the son of german immigrants who are staunch supporters of lincoln  and jack  an equally staunch southerner whose values jake shares .  i had to re  read that sentence to make sure i hadn  t written  jack  instead of  jake  at some point or vice versa .  the two go off to become  bushwhackers   southern militia who so strongly lust after revenge and violence that they can  t even be bothered to join the official southern army  which i presume they think is for sissies . i  m afraid lee lost me right there . it  s easy to feel for characters who make moral mistakes if we have some independent reason to like them  or feel as if we know them in some way  then their moral flaws can make us care for them all the more . not so here . we aren  t properly introduced to jake for at least an hour when we are  it becomes clear he  s a gormless pimple of a man  who isn  t a confederate by choice so much as by habit  the kind of person who says and does what everyone around him says and does  whose psychology is purely immitative . the people he associates with are either just the same or positively evil in some uninteresting way . i found myself cheering whenever the northern cavalry appeared on the screen . i thought good  kill the rebels  end the damned war  let me go home .  br    br   aggravating this problem is the horrible  horrible dialogue . everyone speaks in the same whining southern accent . i  ve heard accents from all over the english  speaking world and this is the worst of them all . i don  t care if southerners really did talk like that  it  s simply not fair to ask an audience to listen to it for two hours . and believe me  we do listen to it for the full two hours lee  s picture is a talky one  largely because characters take so long to say what they mean in their ungrammatical  say  everything  three  times  folksy drawl . it would help if they talked faster  but not much . can  t these people find a more efficient language in which to communicate   br    br   in short the film is little but a gallery of uniformly unattractive characters with no inner life  who talk in an offensively ugly mode of speech  who don  t bathe often enough  to whom nothing of interest happens  despite their being involved in a war . good points  jewel was nice to look at  and so was the scenery . but i have complaints even here . the cinematography  nicely framed  looked as if someone had susbtituted colour film for black and white by mistake and as for jewel  we were teased with her body  but never actually allowed to gaze upon it  which i think is the least we were owed .  ,0
one word can describe this movie and that is weird . i recorded this movie one day because it was a japanese animation and it was old so i thought it would be interesting . well it was  the movie is about a young boy who travels the universe to get a metal body so he can seek revenge . on the way he meets very colorful characters and must ultimately decide if he wants the body or not . very strange  if you are a fan of animation  science  fiction you might want to check this out .  ,1
a serious comedy . ross hunter  produced movie version of the french play  les joies de la famille   later americanized as  a very rich woman   is plush  well cast  occasionally funny . . . and unfortunately timeless . a wealthy california widow  who appears to be frittering away her money  is railroaded by her two grown  greedy daughters  both of whom are afraid mama rosie is carelessly spending their inheritance . the whole issue of a vital   but aged   woman sent to a rest home against her will  and later having to prove herself sane in a court hearing  is touchy material for a comedy  and to his credit  director david lowell rich doesn  t overload the picture with crass gags or obvious sentiment  . some of the humor is a little broad and doesn  t work  yet rosalind russell understands the gravity inherent in this scenario and never hits a false note . sandra dee is also good as rosalind  s granddaughter  and james farentino is very charming as a young lawyer . the movie has so much to say about the importance of our elderly  and the ways in which they choose to spend their remaining time  that the seriousness of  rosie    s theme almost gets lost in the rush to a happy ending . the picture leaves you smiling   and at the same time wondering how many older ladies there are who were never quite so lucky .  from   ,1

what was with all the turkish actors  no offense but i thought it was all for nothing for all these actors . the film had no script to test any actors acting skill or ability . it demanded next to nothing i bought this film to see michael madsen . he is one of my favorite actors but this film was another failure for him . the script was so bad . their was just nothing to sink your teeth into and all the characters were two dimensional . madsen tried to act like a hard ass but the script and direction didn  t even allow him to do enough with his character to make it more interesting or  dimensional .  br    br   even the sound effects of the gunfight at the beginning of the film sounded like the noise of paint ball guns when they are fired in a skirmish . it was really weird and they didn  t sound like real guns . a video game had better sound effects than this film . there was also a really annoying bloke at the beginning of the film who was a member of the robbery gang . he had this american whining voice like a girl shouting lines like  lets get the fk out of here  and what are we going to do man  . he sounded like a girl . as a positive it was funny to watch and it made me laugh too . for a few seconds . whoo hoo  dumb film . poor madsen . he will bounce back . . .  ,0
the only possible way to enjoy this flick is to bang your head against the wall  allow some internal hemorrhaging of the brain  let a bunch of your brain cells die and once you are officially mentally retarded  perhaps then you might enjoy this film .  br    br   the only saving grace was the story between raju and stephanie . govinda was excellent in the role of the cab driver and so was the brit girl . perhaps if they would have created the whole movie on their escapades in india and how they eventually fall in love would have made it a much more enjoyable film .  br    br   the only reason i gave it a  rating is because of govida and his ability as an actor when it comes to comedy .  br    br   juhi chawla and anil kapoor were wasted needlessly . plus the scene at heathrow of the re  union was just too much to digest . being an international traveler in the post     world  anil kapoor would have got himself shot much before he even reached the sky bridge to profess his true love   but then again the point of the movie was to defy logic  gravity  physics and throw an egg on the face of the general audience .  br    br   watch it at your own peril . at least i know i have been scarred for life    ,0
walter pidgeon is braley mason  a civil attorney who takes on a criminal case in  the unknown man   a     film also starring ann harding  barry sullivan  keefe braselle  and richard anderson . a great believer in justice  pidgeon accepts a pro bono case defending a young man  rudi walchek  braselle  accused of murder and gets him acquitted . shortly afterward  he realizes that the man is guilty and was extorting protection money from his victim as well as other shopkeepers in the neighborhood . he is advised by the da  sullivan  that rudi is small change  that to wipe out the organized crime  one has to find the top man . mason finds the top man  and is faced with a dilemma .  br    br    the unknown man  is a small  black and white film that manages to hold the viewer  s interest with its various plot twists  though the plot is somewhat contrived . it  s really the story of a good man seeking his god  justice  and what he is willing to do in order to attain it . and that  s the most contrived part of all . i suppose there was a time before o . j .  the menendez brothers  etc .  etc .  when people believed in justice and the integrity of attorneys . for this viewer anyway  those days are long over .  br    br   walter pidgeon does an excellent job   his handsome  elegant demeanor and declamatory voice show us a successful  confident man but also a deeply caring one . pidgeon had a magnificent career spanning   years but never really rose to superstardom . he was a solid actor who could play just about anything and did . it may be because by the time he was getting leads  he was well into his thirties and missed being a matine idol or it could be he lacked that certain something or that he was typed early on as second lead to a big female star like greer garson . hard to say . he gives an honest and touching performance here .  br    br   very good movie with good performances .  ,1
if you were born around the time this movie was finished  and had a liberal  open minded household that i had  i  m sure during the early    s you  d be first introduced to walking in on your parents watching dirty movies or extreme dirty movies . you know  not     pornographic but rather an alchemical mixture of actual drama and pornography  or that you  d sneak into their collection and pop in the plastic rectangle representation of such a film in a big dookie machine called a vhs . you had to be very quiet and ninja like but still having minor heart failure when huge pop noises were made when pressing the tablet  like buttons out of fear of being discovered . whatever the case  such films were sent into the back of your mind  waiting and waiting to be reunited with such visual  art  . needless to say  this movie fits into the aforementioned description to a  t  . many people will comment on the extreme sexual nature of the film but perhaps due to me being desensitized  i am more disturbed by the subtleties . was the creator speaking to us on deeper levels of human carnality and or what could be considered a true abomination  interracial relations  bed frame masturbation  voyeurism  or could it be desperation for social status to the point of murder  pedophilia  homosexuality  or the repressed sexual nature of social elitist females in   th century france  who can say  but despite mr . borowcyzk  s taste for vivid  raw sexuality being the  norm  for his works  i  d say that indeed this movie does speak to the viewer on a deeper level concerning bestial carnality . once i have learned this  the story became much more interesting beyond the giddiness of shock value and there fore  it is well worth checking out .  ,1
i now that these days  some people wan  t see a movie without movie styling  so much dogma  lars von  watchosky brothers  are changed what we expect in a movie  perhaps  casomai is no  one  more  independent  non  american movie  the movie take all movies resources and language to tell us a simple history about love and marriage  but much more . . fully of views  lectures and let you thinking . . . and i  m sure  you can  t fell boried any second of a long    minutes . i calculate that don  t have a single scene longer that  o     minutes .  ,1
i am usually disappointed by network movies . even flix that attract big name actors are usually ruined by the tv people . however  this one is the worst of the worst . the screenplay is weak and the acting  especially that of tracey pollan is abominable . i  ve trudged off to see my kids  high school plays and been treated to better acting . pollan acts as if she is reading the script as she speaks . when she tries to express fear  anger or grief  it  s extremely hollow . because of the overall quality of the production i found it difficult to take it seriously . if you decide to brave this one just be prepared for a big disappointment . scary things won  t scare you  sad things won  t make you sad  romance won  t make you feel warm and fuzzy and you will likely be as anxious as i was to see the end arrive .  first to die  says a lot about this movie .  ,0
somewhat funny and well  paced action thriller that has jamie foxx as a hapless  fast  talking hoodlum who is chosen by an overly demanding u . s . treasury agent  david morse  to be released on the streets of new york to find a picky computer thief  hacker  doug hutchinson   who stole forty  two million dollars from the treasury and left two guards shot dead .  br    br    bait  marks the sophomore feature for antoine fuqua   the replacement killers   and he handles the task fairly well even though it doesn  t top his first movie . what the two films have in common is the action sequences  which are flat  out excellent .  br    br   foxx is pretty good here although his character is annoying in the beginning  but throughout the film  i began to catch on . hutchinson is marvelous as the mastermind who can be ruthless as john malkovich and patient as the late laurence olivier was in  marathon man  . morse is okay as the agent who comes up with the ingenious plan to get whoever did it at all cost .  ,1
a big surprise  probably because i was expecting it to suck . the reviews were pretty dismissive of it  even though they all seemed to agree that the concept was golden a man finds out his new girlfriend is a super hero  and finds  when he wants to break up with her  that she  s kind of a psycho . i kept expecting it to fall apart  but it never really did . sure  it doesn  t make as much of its awesome premise as it could  and chooses to be short when it might have been better to expand the film  s universe . but i can  t blame it for that . uma thurman is great as the bipolar superhero  g  girl . and i  ve discovered  after several years of disliking him  that luke wilson can be absolutely perfect when cast as a schlub . he  s given two of the best comic performances of      the other in the pretty much unreleased idiocracy  . i absolutely cracked up at the expressions on his face when he and thurman first have sex . it  s one of the funniest sex scenes ever . my only real complaint is that they make g  girl a bit too much of a psycho  like almost unbelievably so . maybe with some background i could have accepted it better . i can forgive its flaws  though  because i had a really good time watching it . underrated  for sure .  ,1
like all carnosaur movies  this is a joke . the way the dinosaurs move  reminds me of when my sister plays with her dolls  because they cannot be any stiffer or more fake  looking than they were .  br    br   the plot had no sense whatsoever . i mean  first they  re on a bus  then in a warehouse then  all of a sudden  they  re on a boat . and let  s be serious  does it make sense that a couple of dinosaurs can stay together on a van  or on a ship  i thought dinosaurs were the biggest animals  and now they can fit on a moving van . it sounds stupid even when you think about it .  br    br   the only reason for which i gave this a   is because it  s still entertaining . i found it better than the first one  haven  t watched the second yet  . just  don  t rent it . i saw it on tv and it  s a good thing i did because i wouldn  t have wanted to waste money renting it .  ,0
an illegal immigrant resists the social support system causing dire consequences for many . well filmed and acted even though the story is a bit forced  yet the slow pacing really sets off the conclusion . the feeling of being lost in the big city is effectively conveyed . the little person lost in the big society is something to which we can all relate  but i cannot endorse going out of your way to see this movie .  ,0
i  m not a fan of the left behind book series  the books are written at a  th  grade reading level with a lack of research and understanding of science  technology  and politics . while the books do manage to remain faithful to scripture  their methods of fulfilling prophecy are often ridiculous  an example is their explanation for the russian  arab invasion of israel  . also  the books have an unmistakable preachy tone that will turn off unbelievers rather than bring them to the gospel . still  i found myself reading these books because of my interest in the events of revelation . for a similar reason  i watched this film adaptation . i am sad to say that it is a rather mediocre film bordering on poor . the acting is actually rather decent for the most part with occasional bits of poor acting and over  acting . the script is rather bad  though it is hardly unexpected when starting with the novel as a basis . the characters are poorly drawn and underdeveloped . events feel scattered and disconnected . the dialogue sometimes sounds rushed . at least the book managed to flesh out its hokey conspiracy theory . here  the viewer is left with an incoherent mess that only makes much sense if one has read the book . the pacing of the film is also very poorly executed with the opening and conclusion seeming extremely rushed  and the middle dragging to an excruciatingly slow trudge that makes it feel padded . the music is schizophrenic . at times  it successfully underscores the mood and sounds fitting for a motion picture . at other moments  it reminds me of sitcom and mini  series music . and still other bits remind me of a poppy mtv soundtrack that just doesn  t belong in the film . i can give the film points for the scene of panic on board the plane  but that  s it . the other scenes involving the disasters after the rapture are far from compelling . the film also suffers from the book  s preachiness although its message isn  t quite as in your face . in all  i found the movie just as disappointing as the series . this is not the film to rally christians around it . i hope that this film does not get any attention at the theaters next year . it would be more unnecessary bad publicity for christianity . for an example of a compelling  intelligent  well  researched series based on revelation that presents a realistic and christian world view without offending the secular reader  who after all should be whom a christian is trying to reach  read the christ clone trilogy by james beauseigneur . it  s a great read and is a much better choice for unbelievers or believers who appreciate quality .  ,0
  br    br   however  the ladies of all ages will lap it up  no doubt at least the opposite sex understand what it is to be a mother  and most of us men try to fathom out what it is to be a father . whether changing nappies is not at all my favourite occupation and trying to get those bottled baby  foodstuffs into errant toothless mouths must rank very high on household duties preferably left to its mother  has absolutely nothing to do with the matter .  br    br   some good interpretations here  and a good story idea the handling of the matter  limited to rather scanty tv  production concepts  gives the film a rather over  mellowy taste with not much new to offer . an insipid way of delivering the goods  and in the end the outcome is so forseeable during the last   minutes or so  even my wife dozed off  and i was jumping up to the computer to get the on  line scoring in the barcelona  deportivo match  hoping the away team would do something rather good . they did . this film did not .  br    br   better by far is mike leigh  s magnificent  secrets and lies   qv  which touches on the same subject matter  but with brenda blethyn playing a far superior part .  ,0
the  gangster  genre is now a worn subject one that is too often subjected to parody . in retrospect the series is a culmination of previous clichs that have been utilized in it  s genre  thankfully the writers have advanced upon this flaw by creating a realism which has been applied to it . the sopranos is an epic crime saga that illustrates it  s content with psychological depth that is characterized with subtle nuance  humor and unvarnished violence . the key protagonist tony soprano is perceived as a perilous general bereft of fear and moral values by his crew  however  tony is of two persona  s one which is bestial while the other is conflicted with guilt and resent . with out any inhibitions or contradictions i still adamantly believe that the sopranos has the finest ensemble cast of recent memory . all things considered i could make an elaborate statement on the series  but i won  t . if ever there is a visual dictionary in global consumerism search for these definitions vital  ambiguous  unrelenting  epic  uncompromising and the sopranos shattered visage will be smiling right back at you .  ,1
i saw this movie as a child and it broke my heart  no other story had such a unfinished ending . . . i grew up on many great anime movies and this was one of my favourites  because it was so unusual  a story about unfairness  and cruelty  and loneliness  and life  and choices that can  t be undone  and the need for others . chirin is made alone when the wolf kills his mother  but the wolf is alone  too  when chirin follows him into the mountain . the wolf doesn  t kill the lamb  even though each night he says  maybe i  ll eat you tomorrow .  the tape of it i have is broken and degraded from age and use . i will repair it and watch the movie again someday and cry just as hard as i did as a child . stories like this  with this depth and feeling  and this intricacy of meaning  are very rare . it is a sad story  but i  ve never encountered any catharsis more beautifully made . i am glad i have seen this movie  and i  m glad i saw it as a child .  ,1
you just got to love opening sequences like the one in  seven women for satan   during the intro there  s a naked girl running through the woods  chased by a hunting dog and a malignant looking dude on a horse  until she falls off a cliff and splits her head open on a rock . then the camera zooms out on the face of the guy and we notice how he  s simply sitting behind a desk whilst his secretary waiting for him to sign some papers .  oh i  m sorry  i was lost in my thoughts  he then says  sweet  i have stumbled upon yet another completely bonkers movie . even if you only understand a minimum of french and have a look at the original title  you immediately know that  seven women for satan  hasn  t got anything to do with satan or ritual sacrifices  but simply revolves on the flamboyant escapades of a perverted and mentally unstable count during his weekend in the countryside . this is  in fact  another sleazy variation on the classic milestone  the most dangerous game  about a lunatic  s disturbing hobby of hunting people  preferably hot naked chicks  in the forest for sports . well actually  this is more than just a variation on the     classic  as writer  director  actor michel lemoine had the pretension to directly link his protagonist to leslie banks  legendary villain in  the most dangerous game  . count zaroff supposedly is the original count zaroff  s son but he exchanged his private island for the remote french countryside . he also can  t afford to be unemployed anymore  so he  s an office clerk from monday to friday and a maniacal killer during the weekend . zaroff is a genuine weirdo who hallucinates about dancing with deceased woman but actually runs his car over the live ones . his butler once pledged to prevent the zaroffs from killing  but he  s obviously doing a lousy job . there isn  t any depth in the screenplay and the build  up certainly doesn  t pay attention to suspense or sinister atmosphere . really  the only useful thing to do during this film is count the girls that are lured for zaroff  s deceptive trap and hope they  ll reach seven rapidly . half of the film is pointless and tedious padding footage  like the overlong erotic dance act in which a statue inexplicably transforms into a muscular black guy       and the other half exists of psychedelic sleaze that eventually grows tiresome as well even though all the girls look ravishing . i have the impression that it was michel lemoine  s intention to imitate his pal jean rollin and make a deliriously kinky sex  thriller .  seven women for satan  is a french production  so inevitably it also stars jess franco regular howard vernon   the awful dr . orloff    zombie lake   . lemoine himself surely has the looks of a crazy killer  but not the talent to depict one .  ,0

i previously thought that this film was the lamest of the muppet films . i would like now to retract that statement . in my opinion now  the lamest muppet film was the tv movie it  s a very merry muppet christmas  am it  s a wonderful life rip off that was truly dreadful . muppets take manhattan is nothing special  but miles more enjoyable than merry muppet christmas .  br    br   the best songs are that  you can  t take no for an answer  song  the one the muppet babies sing and the songs for the big finale itself . as i loved the muppet babies tv show  i loved the muppet babies sequence here  i  m told that it was what inspired the muppet babies show   br    br   the manhattan melodies show itself was the real showstopper  with muppets from sesame street even appearing for the wedding . as kermit puts it in his final line  what better way could anything end   . but i wish that what was between the beginning and end was a bit more entertaining . there are cute cameos from brooke shields and gregory hines and a great dance sequence from rizzo and the rats  choreographed by the late  great jim henson himself  and the film certainly entertains . i must state though that muppet movie  great muppet caper and muppet christmas carol are the three defininitive muppet movies .  ,1
good film . tells a boyish fantasy story  telling us how trapped we are in social situations and what kind of extreme measures one has to take to behave differently . or at least the feeling that you have to break every rule if you are to break one . if you wanted to express love for someone you don  t know  how would you do it without creating a pressing social situation  also it  s about the fascism of deciding over others cultural life  of what kind of culture that is jammed down our throats . what gives disney or fox or the suicide bomber the right to decide what is our choice . are one not allowed to drink the morning coffee by one self . do we have to listen to the nrj shouting  see the stupid tabloid headlines and the street commercials before we even have had our morning coffee   ,1
this movie is a masterpiece a story of a young woman during the war  and it really happen  not exactly as the movie  but it is a great story  i was impress by this film  the acting and the story where great i like this film because it is a true story it  s giff me a feeling that i was there and i feel sorry for the ca  rector that maruschka detmers is playing because who wants to end here life that way . i recommend that everybody have to see this film  special the young ones and ma by the learn something from this film . this film you can compare whit the movie soldier from orange or any real story that happened in the ww  .  ,1
  st watched             out of    dir  robert ellis miller   emotional christmas fluff that doesn  t really get specific enough to explain how the real story happened in this factual  based incident of a man who is wrongly put in jail trying to get a job for his family to make christmas happen for them . the three kids in the family then run away from home on a trek to washington d . c . to enlist the then president of the united states  herbert hoover . this trek provides some side stories like their positive encounters with a hobo and a puppeteer  which makes the story kind of like a disney  animals on the run  movie and doesn  t quite fit here . at the ending  there isn  t any details given as to how the president helped the family and this is another downpoint to the movie  in my opinion . the movie does eventually bring tears  but it takes too long to get to this . the movie isn  t supposed to have been an original tv movie  according to imdb  but it has the obvious fade  outs that make it look this way  so i  m not sure their information is accurate . all in all  this is a simple movie  that could have been more complex  with a happy christmas  like story but blandly played and without a lot of substance .  ,0
the original movie  man from snowy river  is one of the best i  ve seen  nearly perfect . a lady and the tramp storyline in two senses   rich girl  poor boy  and ability vs . bloodline . the sequel  however  is not only a shameless attempt to capitalize on the good name of the original but also a ridiculous  overblown disneyfied mess best summarized as  rambo meets the black stallion .  without the charm of the black stallion . the young hero comes back from a   year absence  and suddenly he  s superman on horseback in the original  good film  he was real and believable  but sadly reduced to a caricature in the sequel . i  ve hardly been as disappointed in a movie  and at times this thing made me quite angry   they missed hardly a clich . brazen audience manipulation   do studio heads think that all you have to do with a horse  loving audience is put pretty horses in front of them  to make them happy  a mess of a movie .  ,0
spoiler alert  although i think this one was spoiled coming out of the can it  s hard to even imagine that a film with these stars  from this studio  made at this time period  could be so awful  but it is . it is the film  s biggest flaw by far that it just doesn  t make any damn sense .  br    br   rich widower american aristocrat penn gaylord leaves his small daughter  in charge  and goes off to world war i where he is killed . then we flash forward to present day       and total confusion . the three sisters are in court where they are said to have spent the last twenty years  and some jerk named barclay is trying to take their home away from them . this is just the beginning of an endless series of unanswered questions that comprises the script  more holes in it than the warren report . what happened to the gaylord fortune  if the will is worth half a billion  why has the family home gone from an opulent palace to the house on the munsters  who the devil is this barclay clown  and why is he able to take someone  s home away from them  the questions just pile on top of more questions .  br    br   the usually affable and charming george brent is playing barclay  who is inexplicably a total sod tromping all over everyone  taking whatever the heck he wants no matter who it belongs to and without a twinge of guilt yet no one besides fiona  barbara stanwick  seems to particularly dislike this cretin . why  none of these questions are ever answered . we instead just follow fiona  s life from one train wreck to another  the evil barclay takes away her home  her fortune  and even her child . what does she do  shoot him  set him on fire  no  too logical . in a completely improbably wrap  up  this woman  who  s only prior romantic involvement with barclay was  save for the technicality of marriage  rape  suddenly decides mid  sentence  literally  that she does not hate him  she loves him . and they  re going to live happily ever after . all of a sudden for no reason in the world  this early female role model of independence and authority is transformed into the usual helpless ankle  twisting twit more commonly found in films of this era . yeah  sure  steal everything in the world that belongs to me and i  ll fall in love with you . on what planet does that happen  i can only guess the reason i never heard of this film before i happened to catch it on turner is that it was as lost on contemporary audiences as it is today .  ,0

i saw this movie as a teenager and immediately identified with reese witherspoon  s portrayal of dani trant  a    year  old tomboy in rural louisiana circa     . she feels that she will never be as beautiful as her older sister  maureen  a now rarely seen emily warfield   and feeling out of place in terms of her conservative baptist upbringing . then seventeen year old court foster  jason london   the son of her mother  s close friend  gail strickland  moves in next door  dani experiences her first crush  while court enjoys her company  and willful spirit . dani succeeds in getting her first kiss from him  but as soon as he sees maureen  he falls head over heels for her  leaving dani behind . the sisters  close bond is fractured severely by the rivalry that erupts  which only deepens when court dies in a tragic accident . the girls then are made to realize how much they need each other .  br    br   sam waterson and tess harper are just perfect as the loving parents  trying to balance their daughters  individuality  at the same time trying to keep the family together . the beautiful cinematography  and the wonderful soundtrack featuring elvis presley  the platters and many more contribute wonderfully to the film  s atmosphere of a simpler time .  br    br   a touching coming  of  age film with a timeless message .  ,1
that is the best way i can describe this movie which centers on a newly married couple who move into a house that is haunted by the husband  s first wife who died under mysterious circumstances . that sounds well and good  but what plays out is an hour of pure boredom . in fact one of the funny things about this flick is that there is a warning at the beginning of the film that promises anyone who dies of fright a free coffin . well trust me  no one ever took them up on that offer unless someone out there is terrified of plastic skulls  peacocks  weird gardeners  and doors being knocked on . and the music is the worst  it consists of constant tuba music which sounds like it is being played by some sixth grader . and you will figure out the terrible secret that is so obvious that you really have to wonder what the people in this movie were thinking . someone dies while running and hitting their head and the police are never called to investigate . yes in the end this is a slow paced  which is really bad considering the movie is only just over an hour   boring little tale  that is easily figured out by the average person . apparently none of the characters in this flick were the average person .  ,0
john heder was absolutely horrendous in this movie . i felt like i was watching a bad college kid act for the first time in a student film . anna farris was par for the course  not good  but not horrible  plus she  s cute  . dianne keaton should have known better . jeff daniels was the only saving grace in this movie  even though it was poor judgement on his part as well  .  br    br   all in all  i would avoid this at all costs . i  m just glad i didn  t pay to see it   br    br   john heder will forever be stuck in the typecast role of  the dorky kid   unless he does some serious work on his acting chops .  ,0
this was a movie that i had heard about all my life growing up  but had never seen it until a few years ago . it  s reputation truly proceeded it . i knew of michael myers  had seen the mask  saw commercials for all of the crummy sequels that followed . but i was growing up during the decade where jason and freddy had a deadly grip on the horror game  and never thought much of the halloween franchise . boy  how i was being cheated with cheap knock offs .  br    br   halloween is a genuinely terrifying movie . now  by today  s standards  it isn  t as graphic and visceral  but this film delivers on all the other levels most horror movies fail to achieve today . the atmosphere that john carpenter creates is so creepy  and the fact that it is set in a quaint  mid  west town is a testament to his ability . the lighting effects are down right horrifying  with  the shape  seemingly appearing and disappearing into the shadows at will . the simple yet brutally effective music score only adds to the suspense .  br    br   the performances by all the players are well done  with specific nods to jamie lee curtis and donald pleasance . ms . curtis is such a good laurie strode because she is so likable and vulnerable . it is all the more frightening when she is being stalked by michael myers because the director and viewer have invested so much into her  we want her to survive and get away .  br    br   donald pleasance plays dr . loomis like a man on a mission  and it works well . he adds a sense of urgency to the predicament the town finds itself in because he knows what evil stalks their streets .  br    br   overall  not only is halloween a great horror movie  but also a great film . it works on many levels and draws the audience in and never lets up . this should be standard viewing for anyone wanting to experience a truly scary movie . and for an even more frightful time  try watching it alone with the lights off . don  t be surprised if you think you see  the shape  lurking around in the shadows   ,1
this was a favorite of my childhood  i can remember seeing it on television and thrilling to it each time . now that i  m grown up and have a kid of my own  i wanted to introduce him to this classic movie . we watched it last friday  and he liked it . during abu  s fight with the giant spider  my son  s hand crept over and took hold of mine  he was genuinely scared .  is he gonna beat the spider  poppa   just watch  you  ll see . he has no historical frame of reference to speak of  eight years old   so bagdad under the grandson of haroun al  raschid might as well be oz under ozma .  br    br   i think he especially liked how much of the heroics and derring  do were perpetrated by the boy  thief  and not the grown  up king . in fact  if you deconstruct the film  s narrative a bit  the king is the thief  s sidekick  not the hero at all  which must be very satisfying to imaginative  adventurous young boys .  br    br   it  s definitely a period piece  i suspect that by the time he  s eleven or twelve  my son will find it  corny  or whatever word the next generation will be using by then . the love story is barely one  dimensional  as a cynical friend commented   why does ahmad love the princess  because the narrative demands it .  the willingness of abu to put himself in jeopardy  repeatedly  for the clueless  love  struck deposed king is equally improbable . but to quibble about such things while accepting flying mechanical horses  fifty  foot genies and the temple of the all  seeing eye would be fatuous in the extreme . the satisfaction of seeing the prophecy fulfilled at the movie  s climax is tremendous  as is the final shot of abu triumphantly flying away on his  stolen  magic carpet  seeking  some fun  and adventure at last    ,1
i was really disappointed in this movie . those that voted this thing a   have a screw lose . the acting was ok  kinda wooden and cardboard . the ending was sorry . i just didn  t care for this at all .  br    br   no way could i recommend this mess .  ,0
      possible spoiler       br    br   youd think a story involving archie grey owl  an englishman posing as a red indian  would have a massive amount of humour involved . in fact id say the only way to treat a film like this where a remarkable man cons the gullible public is to treat it as a comedy . however richard attenborough commits something akin to a crime by making grey owl a serious drama . worse  hes made an extremely dire film too . pierce brosnan lacks the charisma needed for the title role and the romantic subplot between grey owl and pony  played by the equally wooden annie gaupeau  lacks any type of on screen chemistry . but to be fair to the cast their not helped with the script which fails to portray archie as the cheeky chappy he is of fooling everyone into believing hes a native american . the producers and screenwriter have made the major error of having the film centre around the plot twist of archie being an englishman  thats why i wrote  possible spoiler  its not actually revealed untill late in the film that the title character is english  but its obvious that everyone who viewed this movie knew that beforehand hence theres absolutely no surprise involved .  br    br   yes i do agree with everyone that the scenery is lovely and that it has a deep ecological message which isnt actually a new concept . theodore roosevelt was the first important environmentalist of the   th century if truth be told . and it should also be remembered that with the exception of soylent green  and possibly the two towers if you want to class it as having a green message  that there hasnt actually been a great ecological film . in fact most environmentally concious films suck and that includes grey owl  a film that unsurprisingly had a serious problem in finding a distributor  ,0
if you are used to seeing gabriel byrne in serious roles such as tom in millers crossing or keaton in the usual suspects i recommend you take a look at this film . even if you are not a fan of gabriel byrne in particular  all the actors in this film give really great performances . if you  ve got about eleven bucks  that is close to nine quid  i say order it online  or rent it from you favorite movie rental place . guaranteed to make you laugh  whether or not you normally like gangster type movies . mad dog time  trigger happy is one of those movies you never forget  and find yourself watching over and over . you will talk about it so much your friends will be begging to borrow it .  ,1
cinderella . . . .  br    br   i hadn  t watched this film for about five years the last time i saw it . the magic remains . there is something that definitely contains that storybook feel  the songs entertain and the secondary character  s all please . the villains in the form of step sisters are perfectly evil and vile . then there is the most magical of all disney  the mice making the dress and well you know the rest . to sum up the four of the disney princess movies are all great but this is a charming magical experience  watch and enjoy . oh and of course  cinderella is wonderful as the main character in the movie .  br    br   if you think about it disney movies can really lost their charm . with elene wood and others the movie has such a feel to it  you simply can  t help but smile  br    br   they say the moral of this story is that dreams come true . of course in the real world some are believers others are hoper  s . in this film it  s even more the magical when her rainbow comes smiling .  br    br   and of course the rest is . . . cinderella  ,1

watching davidbathsheba is a much better way of getting your bible lesson that going to sunday school . despite a script that at times is unintentionally funny the film is highly entertaining . the studio system had its faults but it spared no expense when a lavish production was called for . peck portrays king david as a lusty but tormented poet who commits what is tantamount to murder to bed a sexy bathsheba  susan hayward . raymond massey as the prophet nathan delivers his usual saturnine and ferocious performance . look for the silent screen star francis x . bushman as king saul and a young gwen verdon as a dancer . hooray for the old testament and hollywood .  ,1
i caught evening in the cinema with a lady friend . evening is a chick flick with no apologies for being such  but i can say with some relief that it  s not so infused with estrogen that it  s painful for a red  blooded male to watch . except for a single instance at the very end of the movie  i watched with interest and did not have to turn away or roll my eyes at any self  indulgent melodrama . ladies  for their part  will absolutely love this movie .  br    br   ann lord is elderly  bed  ridden and spending her last few days on earth as comfortably as possible in her own home with her two grown daughters at her side . discomfited by the memories of her past  ann suddenly calls out a man  s name her daughters have never heard before harris . while both of her daughters silently contemplate the significance of their mother  s strong urge to recall and redress her ill  fated affair with this mysterious man at this of all times  ann lapses back in her head to the fateful day she met harris  and in doing so  lost the youthful optimism for the future that we all inevitably part ways with .  br    br   both ann and her two daughters  one married with children  one a serial  commitophobe   struggle with the central question of whether true love really exists  and perhaps more importantly  if true love can endure the test of time . are we all one day fated to realize that love never lasts forever  will we all realize that settling for the imperfect is the only realistic outcome  the subtle fact that the aged ann is still wrestling with an answer to these questions on her deathbed is not lost on her two daughters .  br    br   the cinematography for evening is interesting  most of the film is spent in ann  s mind as she recalls the past  and for that reason i think the film was shot as if it was all deliberately overexposed  to give everyone an ethereal glow  and thus make it very obvious that all of this is not real  but occurred in the past  . claire danes is beautiful  appearing to be really  really tall  though just     in reality   and is absolutely captivating in one climactic scene where her singing talents are finally put to the test .  br    br   you can  t really talk trash about the cast  which leads off with claire danes and doesn  t let up from there vanessa redgrave  patrick wilson  meryl streep and glenn close fill out the other major and minor roles in the film .  br    br   i can  t really say anything negative about this film at all  though hugh dancy  s struggle to have his character emerge from utter one  dimensionality is in the end a total loss . playing the spoiled  lovable drunk offspring of the obscenely rich who puts up a front of great bravado but is secretly scared stiff of never amounting to anything probably doesn  t offer much in the way of character exploration  he had his orders and stuck to them .  br    br   in the end  gentlemen  your lady friend will most certainly weep  and while you  ll likely not feel nearly as affected  the evening will definitely not be a waste for the time spent watching evening . catch it in theatres or grab it as a rental to trade off for points for when you want to be accompanied to a viewing of die hard  or the upcoming rambo flick . it  ll be your little secret that this viewing didn  t really cost you much at all .  ,1
basically  cruel intentions  is cruel intentions   again  only poorly done . the story is exactly the same as the first one  even some of the lines   with only a few exceptions . the cast is more unknown  and definitely less talented . instead of being seductive and drawing me into watching it  i ended up feeling dirty because it compares to watching a soft  core porn . i  m not sure whether to blame some of the idiotic lines on the actors or the writers . . . and i always feel bad saying that  because i know how hard it is to do both . . . but it was basically a two  hour waste of my life . it literally amazes me that some movies get made  and this is no exception . . . i can  t believe they  d make a third one .  ,0

well  it  s robin hood as  geezer  all right . . . just as advertised  that didn  t sound very hopeful  and alas  it was worse than i  d suspected .  br    br   a laddish robin i can take a robin who tangles with a pert dyer  s daughter i can credit but a robin who exchanges not  very  funny banter with his single henchman is harder to swallow  and a robin and entire cast who seem to be having difficulty managing their lines is the kiss of doom . how could anyone let such laboured delivery pass without re  shooting the scenes  again and again  much sounds as if he  s struggling with half  comprehended shakespeare rather than letting loose with a salty quip i hoped at the onset that it was just a failed comedy trait in a character clearly destined for the role of comedy sidekick  but then it started spreading throughout the rest of the cast .  br    br   whatever else you say about errol flynn in the role  he had the knack of delivering high  flown dialogue as naturally as if he  d just thought it up on the spur of the moment . . . and as this production shows  that  s not at all as easy as it sounds  if they were going to cast the characters as cheeky chappies  the actors in question should have been given appropriate lines they sound as if they haven  t a clue how to handle them .  br    br   i  m afraid i didn  t even like the pantomime sheriff  for a similar reason the lines are clearly not intended to be taken seriously but delivered  and in this case written  with a nudge and a wink at the audience . they  re out of place all right   fourth  wall  busting stuff   but really not that funny .  br    br   this much  promised production reminded me of a limping school play . the only actor and character i felt any appreciation for at all was the one playing guy of gisbourne  who was the sole one who appeared to have any handle on  a  credible villainy and  b  credible characterisation   but frankly  i wouldn  t have said that was a very good augury for the future of the series  as of the time of writing  i  ll give it another shot in the hopes that things may improve and bed down a bit by next week  with less stilted scene  setting required and perhaps the actors more at ease with the dialogue after all  the opening episode of  doctor who  wasn  t exactly a show  stopper  though it was nowhere near as bad as this . but if i see no improvement after episode   i  m afraid the series has almost certainly lost one viewer .  br    br   which would be a pity  because i  ve got a soft spot for the  robin hood  legend on screen  from the adventures of douglas fairbanks to the sturdy reliance of richard greene . but this robin fails to stir my blood in the slightest .  ,0

the movie only enter the cinema in indonesia this year        two years after it  s official release  and after many illegal dvd  s had found its way to the public . apparently the popularity of the illegal dvd  s lead to the release into the theaters  with still public coming to watch .  br    br   the movie is a great epic  bringing japanese culture into your house in an exiting way . in a sometimes humorist way  the story is told about a theater writer who writes a story for his theater  since the regular kabuki theater plays is something he finds boring .  br    br   at first  the audience might be a little bit confused about which story we are following  but when the story unfolds  we see that the love between a male human and a female demon leads to a great story for a new kabuki theater piece .  br    br   the audience is left in the dark if this is a story that is supposed to really have happened in japanese traditions and mythology  but that doesn  t matter .  br    br   the way the story is told with a love for theater  expression  vivid colors  humor and tragedy  makes this a great ride on the roller  coaster of japanese cinema as well as theater .  br    br   let yourself go completely when you watch this movie  try to see it in a cinema instead of on your television at home .  br    br   one critical point though the soundtrack is sometimes a little bit annoying . though most of it is great music  there are a few moments in the movie that i think they should have chosen some more dramatic music . but maybe the fact that the story contains moments of humor made the director choose for lighter moments in music as well .  ,1
i admit i had no idea what to expect before viewing this highly stylized piece . it could have been the cure for a zombie virus or the common cold for all i knew . it began with great visuals  little snippets to grab your attention and cause your imagination to run wild . as it continued i learned quickly through voice overs what was taking place . a nice little neo noir story that i felt was not a waist of a few minutes of my time . the little clues given to the audience through visuals at the beginning give them a sense of accomplishment as they piece together the plot . along with a nice twist at the end its a cool package overall . the score  though not bad  gave the film almost a music video feel . it just felt a little dated  not adding anything to further the storyline . some of the performances felt overly dramatic but fit perfectly with the feel of the overall piece . i walk away from this very satisfied . i was given a lot of information in a short period of time but through great editing and voice  over work it didn  t feel rushed or pushed . great job   ,1
  having grown tired of the rat race and cramped living conditions of new york city  jim blandings  cary grant  finds a property in the country for his wife and children . he  s hoping to find the simple life . but  building a house proves to be anything but simple . as the headaches and the bills start piling up  so do the laughs . will mr . blanding  s ever get his dream house   br    br    what makes this movie so special is the three main actors  grant  myrna loy  and melvyn douglas . any of three are capable of carrying a movie on their own  so when you combine their talents  almost every scene is special . grant has always been a favorite of mine in this type of role . he is so good at playing the put upon husband . loy is a always a joy to watch . the thin man films she made with william powell are near perfect . and douglas has become a favorite of mine over the last two or three years . douglas also appeared in the old dark house  a particular favorite of mine .  br    br    the movie is definitely a product of its time . i get a kick out of imagining a time when you could build a two  story  three bedroom  four bathroom house on        income a year . throw in the fact that your two children attend private school and you have a live  in maid and it becomes almost fanciful .  br    br    however  for anyone who has bought or built a house  many of the situations and predicaments the blanding  s find themselves in are easily relatable to today . and that  s where the comedy comes in . how many people have done some of the stupid things the couple does in this movie only to end up costing more money than expected   the biggest complaint i have about mr . blandings is the whole  wife in love with best friend  subplot . it  s really not necessary to the plot and feels out  of  place and very uncomfortable as presented .  ,1
this is one of those film  s  pilot that if you knew battlestar galactica it helps  but isn  t necessary . what makes this even more believable of a story than bsg is that this isn  t something so far away in the future . this has such a depth to it that it is quite astonishing it was not released theatrically . the leads could not have been chosen better in such experienced  quite talented actors . eric stoltz is superb as the father who will do anything to be re  united w  his daughter however real or not she is  he  ll do it no matter the cost . paula malcomson of  deadwood  fame is terrific as his wife as well . you are not sure completely of his motives whether it  s love or money or both  but that is what makes this pilot even more intriguing . i see a star in the making of zoe played by the relative unknown alessandra torresani  her performance . esai morales is terrific in his desire to see his loved one again  just how wrong to be even considering what he wants more than his moral objections . i didn  t think this would be a good idea when it was announced but from the pilot alone i am thrilled to see how we got to the bsg stage story . it  s great to see adama as a child already being affected  influenced by the different sorts of robots starting to permeate life at this stage . i just hope that they can keep up the stories so we can figure out even more how they got the the humanoid typed robots . this is an almost perfect pilot  i hope they can keep up the fantastic storytelling . even the visual effects are better than most of the garbage you see on the big screen . if you haven  t gotten into bsg   least try this  i  ll bet you become a fan  will want to see how the bsg story came to be .  ,1
grand canyon is a very strange bird . it  s a completely unique urban piece  where relating the entire plot would fail to convey much .  br    br   it  s central theme seems to be the inherent uncertainty life holds for people of every race  background and station . but to proclaim that the theme of the film would be to horribly understate its scope . similarly  to pigeonhole it in a particular genre is futile .  br    br   the film has volumes to say  though likely different volumes for every viewer  and says it all in such a non  preachy way from so many angles  that in the end  i can  t even define its central message for myself .  br    br   nevertheless  it does it  s business with such laser precision every prop  line of dialog  and bar of background music contributing to it  s pervasive mood and powerful message  that i  m pleasantly surprised  and come away very thoughtful after every viewing . still it doesn  t feel at all stuffy . a sparkling film with a great cast and everything working .  ,1
what a dreadful film this is . the only reason you would want to sit through this mess is the pleasurable sight of miss eleniak . the painful overacting of mr mcnamara  which became embarrassing at times  ruined what might have been a reasonable film if the correct actors had been cast . mr mcnamara is no tom cruise  the actor he obviously wants to be .  ,0
this was a hit in the south by southwest  sxsw  film festival in austin last year  and features a fine cast headed up by e . r .  s gloria reuben  and a scenery  chewing john glover . though shot on a small budget in nyc  the film looks and sounds fabulous  and takes us on a behind the scenes whirl through the rehearsal and mounting of what actors call  the scottish play   as a reference to the word  macbeth  is thought to bring on the play  s ancient curse . the acting company exhibits all the emotions of the play itself  lust  jealousy  rage  suspicion  and a bit of fun as well . the games begin when an accomplished actor is replaced  in the lead role  by a well  known  pretty face  from the tv soap opera scene in order to draw bigger crowds . the green  eyed monster takes over from there  and the drama unfolds nicely . fine soundtrack  and good performances all around . the dvd includes director  s commentary and some deleted scenes as well .  ,1

the film is worth watching only if you stop it after half an hour . it starts of with funny conversations in a bar and makes one expect a good  funny story is to come . well  i can tell you it will not come . it will deteriorate in minutes into a movie that challenges your patience as well as your feelings of shame for the actors to an extend you will probably not be pleased to witness .  br    br   in an interview i heard that the director wanted to express in this film the feeling of a loss of identity that  according to him  the majority of the people in this globalizing world experience . i was amazed to hear that . am i living in the same world he lives in  ok a lot of people do walk around in the same clothes as mine and listen to the same music and all  but that doesn  t make me feel like i am losing my identity . what does khrzhanosvky think  that we are not more than the clothes we wear and the movies we watch  am i shortsighted or is he   br    br   well my vote the good start of the movie saves it from getting a   a decent  is my conclusion .  ,0
almost a two  person play  and as such the dialog and the performances of the leads will be important . neither are particularly good . this might have been stronger  in fact  if it had first been crafted as a two  person play  and then worked into a film .  br    br   anyway  a twitchy vampire who seems slightly autistic becomes infatuated with a stripper  as a result of watching too much porn in his crappy home  . he wants to have her tell him about the daylight . he would have been better off finding someone with a day job  or someone who excels at painting a picture with words like a poet  but then they might not have a hot bod .  br    br   after he gets her to do whatever he wants  and he  s not terribly good at it   he intends to feed on her at  am  at which point the sun rises . much is made of that deadline  despite the fact that he also says that he can go without feeding  it will just make him hungrier . additionally  he claims he can  t let the stripper go  since she knows about him  but he lets a number of other people go who learn what he is . there are a lot of inconsistencies .  br    br   why this vampire chooses to live in a house so poorly boarded up that light from streetlamps and neighboring buildings pours in as if it were daytime  i  m not sure . with all the time in the world  you  d think he  d have done a better job  or fixed the place up a bit . he  s clearly not a wealthy vampire .  br    br   this is supposedly a remake  and i  m curious to see the original version of this  dance of the damned . although  that was directed by katt shea  and the other films she directed for corman  stripped to kill  stk ii  were pretty bad .  ,0
extremely interesting and intriguing movie . the similarities to david lynch  who is even quoted literally by the presence of red curtains in the film  and the novels of franz kafka  the house keeper in this film is called mrs . grubach  as is the one in der prozess . . .  are clearly present but in this case are accompanied by clear references to the colonial past of belgium in africa . the exact content of the movie i can not clearly describe this colonialism is an important part  as is the inability to cope with such a past  but the personal memories of the main character are a central issue as well  and his quest for social contact and love . these are the symbolic themes i deduced from the movie  but in fact they  re no more than impressions .  br    br   but even if you just try to follow the linear story without these symbolic backgrounds  you still will discover an extremely fascinating movie filled with splendid imagery  beautiful close ups of beatles  larvas and other nasty insects are alternated with great dream sequences and also the dark atmosphere lends the film extra style  . maybe you can say that i didn  t quite  get  the film  but i have been watching like hypnothised for  .  hour  deeply impressed by the visual quality and the fascinating mysteriosity .  ,1
wow . i do not think i have ever seen a movie with so many great actors that had such a pivotal role so miscast . justin timberlake is perhaps the single worst actor to land a bigtime role in a movie with the star power and money behind it that edison had .  br    br   his acting was painful to observe . the story was ok and all the other characters were played by professional actors  heck  even ll cool j was fine since he has had numerous small parts to cut his teeth on . how the director and movie company figured that timberlake was ready for this role there is no way to comprehend .  br    br   his character ruins the entire experience since every time he is on screen you are actually rooting for the corrupt cops to cap his sorry ass  and he is supposed to be the hero . . . i would not waste money on this one at the theater or on video . maybe if you have hbo and have nothing else to do at  am on a saturday night and you are drunk and stoned  this may be ok .  br    br   watching timberlake in this role was like watching a human  kermit the frog  act in a hollywood blockbuster  just didn  t work at all .  ,0
this drama is unlike sex and the city  where the women have a few drinks and share their sexual encounters with each other . its much more personal and people can relate to it . its much more engaging and emotional on a new level than other dramas focusing on women and their lives like  sex and the city  lipstick jungle . . . .   br    br   dr . katie roden  is a psychologist with a dark secret  she seems much more depressed and guilt ridden than the rest of her  friends . she is dealing with the death of her former lover who was her patient while tackling his son  s advances on her . her sombre clothes and empty and cold house convey her inside emotions very well .  br    br   trudi malloy  a widow is battling issues with  letting go  of her dead husband from     . and when a handsome stranger  richard shows an interest in her she is suddenly forced to do a reality check by her friends who suggest that she gets back into dating business . the ridiculous and embarrassing courting scenes between richard and trudi are totally funny  it is interesting to note that richard asks her out the day she gets a millions from the     board for her husband  s death . . lets see what his intentions are  br    br   siobhan dillon  a lawyer is fed up of her husband  s love making tactics which only involve  baby making   as they are having trouble conceiving  and she quickly falls for her colleague who offer his  services  a little too willingly to her and she does not hesitate for long  it will interesting to see whether she will continue her affair or patch up with her husband  played by raza jeffrey  jessica  a real estate business woman is single and is straight  until she organizes a lesbian wedding and has an affair with one of them . her character is shown as a bold and provocative woman who before her lesbian encounter is having sex with a  married man   her colleague . lets see where her character venture to . . . .  br    br   the beauty of this drama is that we are shown  totally different women with different scenarios  whose ambitions and inhibitions are shown . its also a good thing that the drama reveals the fact that sometimes friends lie to each other to be  safe    ,1
a   year old girl develops her first serious crush on the   year old boy that lives near by  while simultaneously trying to overcome her feelings of inadequacy in comparison to her older sister . that is the simple premise of this beautiful  poetic coming of age film from director robert mulligan . mulligan is famous for previously directing summer of    in     and to kill a mockingbird in      two giants of the coming of age genre . here he directs newcomers in the principal roles reese witherspoon  in her film debut  as the   year old girl emily warfield  as the older sister jason london  as court  the   year old boy . reese witherspoon is astonishingly good in her film debut  displaying every emotion that a   year old girl feels in experiencing young love and hurt  never striking a false note . warfield and london are both equally good as well . the film accurately depicts each adolescent  s thoughts or feelings in regard to love with heartfelt sensitivity  never crossing over into maudlin excess even once . kudos to the autobiographical screenplay from jenny wingfield this is one of the very few films about young love that is honest and consistent in tone without being emotionally dishonest or sensationalist . the music is wonderfully simple  accentuating the tone and mood from scene to scene  but never becoming intrusive . the beautiful cinematography is by famed horror director freddie francis  who was in his    s when this was shot . tess harper and sam waterston play the girls  parents with dead aim accuracy for      caring  strict  and emotionally simple . gail strickland is good also as the boy  s mother . there are feelings to sort out  lessons to learn  and truths to face in this sweet  natured film that packs an emotional wallop . to date  this is robert mulligan  s last film . this is one of the very best films of     .  of  stars .  ,1
i don  t watch much porn  but i love porn stars . and i love gory movies . so when i heard about a porn  star gore movie  i was really excited . of course  that was years ago and when i heard about all the trouble with making and finishing the movie  i never thought i  d actually get to see it . but i did and i  m not ashamed to admit i loved it  even with all its flaws .  br    br   first  the flaws . the story is set in ireland and is called samhain  but the story it seemed to want to tell is about the sawney beane clan from scotland . so why not just set it there and skip the third  grade report about samhain  irish immigrants  halloween  also  it breaks its own rules by stating that you  re safe on the trails  but then the cannibal mutants just start running amok everywhere . it  s never clear how many cannibals we  re dealing with . there  s a big stone castle that  s obviously ancient  yet no one  s noticed it before . the self  conscious horror film references are annoying and so are the characters . the heroine has a flashback montage of all her dead friends that include a character she never met . the ending makes no sense .  br    br   so what works  the gore  sure i would have liked more  but it was refreshing to see such a nasty movie that wasn  t afraid to be nothing more than a gore movie . two murders are waay over the top and taylor hayes has a nice disgusting scene . the two wild murders are even given extended shots on the dvd . i  ve always been of the mind that gore can overcome a stupid story and evil breed reinforced that .  ,1
very bad movie . . . . . . . . and i mean very bad . . . the plot is predictable  and it  s eally cheesy  the creativeness of the battle and the dance scenes for the time are the only reason i didn  t give the movie a one  other than that . . . this is def a movie one can def afford not to watch . . . . . i feel while watching the movie  the idea behind the movie was an interesting one tho kind of clich . . . . bringing country bumpkins to the city blah blah blah  but i feel it might have been at least a little better if it just wasn  t so cheesy  very poorly portrayed from idea to screen  i think . the plot is somewhat predictable at times  tho the dancing i can say at times  is pretty good  the break dance battle twist was good . . . . . if u just pop the movie and watch the dance scenes and make up your own dialog maybe it can be a  . . . lol  ,0
this is some of the worst acting i have ever seen . i love almereyda  s nadja  but this is just absolute dreck . aside from a few moments of interesting cinematography and music this film is just nonstop bad acting and dumb material . jared harris is particularly bad  but no one in this is remotely good . the plot is a joke  but not the haha kind . i don  t even know if you can forgive movies that are this bad . please erase the last hour and a half of my life . how did this director make nadja and another girl another planet   ,0
really  really     i know if you make a political war movie you will get noticed but this movie was just garbage . horrible in every sense . terribly inaccurate in so many ways . i have an easier time believing the president of the united states suiting up  flying a jet fighter  and shooting down aliens . it is easier to note the few things that were right . my jaw dropped when i saw some one say that this movie was the best in the last   years . it was overacted  seemingly pointless plot diversions  and had questionable cinematography at times .  br    br   x  box  youtube  acupat utilities did anyone check that these things did not exist in      it  s not like you had to do extensive research  it was only five years before this movie came out . i am an iraq war veteran and if you spent one day with an infantry platoon or an eod squad you would realize how b . s . this movie is . to compare this to platoon or saving private ryan is ludicrous . why don  t you just throw commando and red dawn in there too i think those might be more accurate .  br    br   if for some reason you can see past the unbelievable plot  the historical and factual discrepancies  then this movie might just be ok . nothing more . if you keep on hearing  oscar buzz   and have to add your own pompous review  go right ahead . as for me  i am writing the director to see if i can get my    minutes back .  ,0
i would just like to state that this may be biased  as i am a producer on the film . however  i will maintain some sense of dignity .  br    br   the star of the film  oscar ovies  gives a stellar performance as jeff grinderlin  a nebbish hypochondriac who spends more time worrying than living . he brings a certain touch to his character that really allows the audience to connect with him  by stating his mind often and with a sense of harsh comedy . his mother  played by christine haber  is the constant support beam  that without  he would crumble upon himself . his friends also lend a hand in jeff  s life  often making choices for him rather than letting him use his free will . . . which often times he neglects is there anyway .  br    br   the writing is superb  and the conversations flow like scenes from a kevin smith movie  with half as much ben affleck boo  hoo fests .  br    br   the camera work is a little shoddy at some points  and the sound could also use a boost  however the performances out shine the minor details . it is also backed by a beautiful soundtrack with local talents and an exceptional composer .  br    br   all in all  this was a treat . a rare gem  among many jewels .  ,1
the idea of in the name of the people is good  a murderer doesn  t want his only daughter to end up in an institution and asks the parents of the girl he killed to take care of his daughter . and you could expect of the actors  especially scott bakula to do some good acting  unfortunately they don  t  in the name of the people turns out to be the regular friday night tearjerker . the flashbacks with the girl that was killed are pretty pathetic and at a certain stage you can just predict what the actors will say . . . if you want to watch a good film about this subject then watch dean man walking   ,0

centered in the downtown and out skirts of detroit  this comedy i found to be a terrific new comedic duo .  noriyuki pat morita  is a very funny man  who happens to be a cop from japan on the trail of an industrial secrets thief  who has stolen a  proto type  turbo super charger  reluctantly he goes to the united states to follow the thief  after being ordered by his commander . pat  s character collides with  jay leno  s  character  a fast talking  but down to business  player type detroit cop . when they cross paths though  the honorable  ways  of japan meet the all  out old school detroit police investigative  ways  . the two stumble and trip over each other at first  but then develop a  rythym  that turns into an explosive two layered powerhouse team  that solves the case  cold . after battling a city crime boss for the stolen  equiptment  and closing the case  these two go from despising each other to being friends and working well together . a little worse for wear and in need of an extended  vacation on top of it all  they manage to come to a victorious closing . i rated this a  . lewis  s direction makes  this a near perfect comedy . fun for all ages . i recommend it highly .     ,1
i was sadly disappointed by this film due to the fact that it felt false and the characters were not strong enough to carry the films pretty weak attempt at horror . the basic idea for the film was interesting but unfortunately it wasn  t able to excite  really scare or shock me  there was one part in the entire film that i thought was gruesome but even that didn  t redeem it . i did get to like the character of kate by the end of the film as she seemed to soften and become a little more realistic by the end  the character played by jeremy sheffield was not actually needed for this film and i think the director  writer got carried away with the myriad of characters used for no purpose  if he had left it at the basic characters making it more of a solo effort on kate  s part  it may have worked  jeremy  s acting was wooden to say the least and i felt uncomfortable watching the bad on screen chemistry  or lack of it . such a shame . disappointing .  ,0
it  s here . finally a movie comes out that i can honestly say is worse than larry the cable guy health inspector . yet i  m willing to bet the the wayan  s brothers  hilarious  will make more money than i ever make in my whole life on what is sure to be one of the top five worst films of all time  outside of my fifth grade outside the class re  enactment of romeo and juliet . i mean really why would anyone ever ever see this movie unless they were paid to . the comedy is weak and all even remotely funny jokes from the flimsy plot were surely revealed in commercials . final word is this movie was a terrible letdown for me . and the commercials looked so promising . . .  ,0
this a superb self  contained work that is unconnected with anything before or after . brat pack crooning and club exclusivity are not my biscuits of choice  but in this law  free world they make an alluring ambiance . the film is packed with our guys  distinctive actors who add distinction to this work with winning performances . the dialogue is a joy . in fact it  s a new vernacular . one of the few films that can be watched repeatedly with deepening appreciation .  br    br   highpoints include billy idol  s british loutishness  ben london  s vulturine brassware  kyle  s squirmishness  and the survey of ad hoc philosophies .  ,1
john cassavetes      film opening night is  what critics usually call the work of such a significant artist   overlooked  . it is an excellent film  in its own right  and one of the best portraits of a midlife crisis ever put to film . it  s not a perfect film  in that  at two hours and twenty four minutes it  s about a half hour too long  and there  s a bit too much emphasis on the drunkenness of the lead character myrtle gordon  played by gena rowlands  the wife of cassavetes  long after we  ve gotten the point . but only woody allen  s masterpiece  another woman  which also starred rowlands  eleven years later  is a better portrait of the internal conflicts of an aging woman . yet  rowlands did win the best actress award at the berlin film festival for this portrayal  and it was well deserved . often this film  written by cassavetes  is easily compared to his earlier  and inferior  film  a woman under the influence  but it  s a spurious comparison . rowlands  character in that film is severely mentally disturbed from the start  as well as coming from a blue collar background  while her characters in this film and in allen  s film are both artists who are haunted by apparitions . in this film it  s the ghost of a dead young woman who can be seen as myrtle  s younger doppelganger  while in allen  s film it  s her character  s own past . many critics have taken this film to be a portrait of an alcoholic  seeing myrtle surround herself with enablers  such as a stage manager who tells her  during opening night   i  ve seen a lot of drunks in my time  but i  ve never seen anyone as drunk as you who could stand up . you  re great    but this is wrong  for alcohol isn  t her problem  nor is her chain smoking . they are merely diversions from whatever thing is really compelling her to her own destruction  and much to cassavetes  credit  as a storyteller  he never lets us find out exactly what  s wrong with myrtle  and despite her coming through in the end  there  s no reason to expect that she has really resolved anything of consequence . this sort of end without resolution links cassavetes directly with the more daring european directors of the recent past  who were comfortable in not revealing everything to an audience  and forcing their viewers to cogitate  even if it hurts .  br    br   yet  the film recapitulates perfectly the effect of a drunk or fever lifting out of the fog  and as such the viewer again is subliminally involved in its drama . whether or not myrtle gordon does recover  after the film  s universe irises about her is left for each and every viewer to decide  and as we have seen before that lid closes  one  s choices do matter .  ,1
effect  s  without cause is generally not possible in the real world but in the world of hollywood remakes  not only is it possible  it  s required . the haunting has been given the computer treatment courtesy of a  st  class cinematographer  turner  director who once showed promise  jan de bont  speed  but has since produced a string of big budget garbage  twister  speed   .  br    br   actor are superfluous in a movie of this type and they seem to realize it . liam neeson and cathrine zeta  jones act like they wish they were anywhere but in this film . lili taylor makes an attempt to add something to the proceedings but whatever that something might be is unknown since the script feels like half of it is missing . events just happen  good and bad ghosts show up with no rhyme or reason and then the story just ends with a most unsatisfying non  event meant to wrap up the previous   minutes of inanity .  br    br   there really isn  t even reason to see this for the effects since we all know that anything can be put on screen now . why not watch effects in the service of a good story instead of just for their own sake   ,0
this is one of the worst films i  ve seen in years   you could randomly pluck  people off the streets and they could act better than anyone in this film . absolute waste of time watching it . i only gave it a  as i like gory films but this is just plain rubbish . the acting  and i use that term very loosely  is abysmal  someone please tell me that the  main actors in this were making their first ever film   don  t waste your time watching this . hostel was a better film by some way . i cannot believe that someone has spent money making this  i hope for the producers sake it only cost        to make  it looks like a school project  made by kids who haven  t got a clue . did this even make it to the cinema    ,0
if you haven  t seen this obscure little charmer  you should seek it out . it is the story of a bumbling  wartime sad sack  fred macmurray  who is listed   f each time he attempts to join any branch of the military . he finds a magic lamp which of course contains a genie  gene sheldon   but the genie is even more bumbling than macmurray is  sending him across time to serve in all the wrong times and places than the one he wants . it is cute  cheerful  and pure fluff  and you can  t help but like it . the plots is much like a disney film  particularly since the two stars  macmurray and sheldon  both made numerous disney films in the    s and    s  although not together . needless to say  it all ends well for everyone  and the viewer goes away feeling pretty good .  ,1
from the start i knew i would be in for the best movie watching experience of my life . the idea of two giant robots  manned by brilliant humans  fighting each other for control of the world was the most intense and well thought of plot i have ever experienced . i can  t even begin to describe the brilliant acting and well written script . let  s just just say it compares to both lord of rings pictures  combined . the academy had a grave oversight in not celebrating the joy that is . . . . . robot jox .  ,1
i saw this gem of a film at cannes where it was part of the directors fortnight .  br    br   welcome to collinwood is nothing short of superb . great fun throughout  with all members of a strong cast acting their socks off . it  s a sometimes laugh out loud comedy about a petty crook  cosimo  played by luis guzman  who gets caught trying to steal a car and sent to prison . while in prison he meets a lifer  who tells him of the ultimate bellini   which to you and me  is a sure  fire get rich quick scheme . it turns out that there is a way through from a deserted building into the towns jewellers shop  which could net millions . sounds simple   well throw in all kinds of wacky characters and incidents along the way and you have got the ingredients for a one wild ride    word passes from one low life loser to the next and soon a team of them are assembled to try and cash in on cosimos bellini  lead by failed boxer pero  superbly played by sam rockwell  surely a star in the making  and reluctant crook riley  william h . macy  who is forced to bring his baby along with him as his wife was locked up for fraud   .  br    br   based on the italian film i soliti ignoti  big deal on madonna street  which also inspired a similar film to collinwood   palookaville  . this knocks spots of the latter effort and although its written and directed by the russo brothers it definitely has shades of the coen brothers about it . produced by steven soderbergh and george clooney  who has a small yet hilarious part as a crippled safe breaker .  ,1
this movie is funny and painful at the same time . the  cinemagic  almost gave me a seizure . despite what they imply   cinemagic  is not some innovative technical procedure . it was  developed  as the result of an accident  and they used it because it disguised the fact that their  monsters  were so stupid  looking . i also don  t think it  s a coincidence that the writer is sid  pink  .  br    br   this movie is good for a laugh  if you are really looking for a movie made in  days on        dollars . it is entertaining at least i can say that about it . the bat  rat  spider is the highlight .  ,0
this is a great movie for the true romantics and sports lovers alike .  br    br   drew barrymore is at her best in this movie . as a drew fan it was quite nice to see her shine after having several flops . i had my doubts about jimmy fallon but he totally delivered as ben the comical  sports crazed sweetheart . the comedy in this movie is great  there were several laugh out loud moments .  br    br   their first date started rocky when he showed up at her apartment with flowers and she was sick to her stomach from eating a new place earlier in the day . instead of leaving he helps take care of her  helping her change into pajama  s then cleaning up the puke on her toilet and bathroom later telling her that she was  very lady  like . . . no chunks .  everything goes great between ben and lindsay the whole winter but then baseball season starts . lindsay starts to realize just how obsessed ben is with the red sox and why this seemingly great guy is still single . she tries to shrug it off and think of it as a good thing as she has a busy work schedule and she wont feel guilty for working extra hours while he is at games . she even buys all the books on the red sox she can find including one on  the curse of bambino  .  br    br   everything is going pretty well until lindsay has a false alarm having missed her period . it both makes them both realize how serious they are getting and she begins to question if this is the person she wants to be with . a very touching part in the movie is after she tells him she got her period it shows him sadly putting away a baby sized red sox jersey he had bought just in case she was pregnant .  br    br   eventually ben tries to show her how important she is and decides to go to her friends birthday party after she said  i had to check my calender and when i saw the there was a red sox  yankee game i knew i would be going stag  . after the party ben tells her it was  the best night of his life  . shortly after he gets a call from his pal who went to the game he gave up for the party and told him  it was the best game ever     ben freaks out about missing it and ends up really hurting lindsay when she says  a few minutes ago you were saying this was the best night of your life  he says  well that was a few minutes ago .   br    br   so they separate for a while  he realizes how immature his obsession is and decides to sell his season tickets which he inherited from his uncle because if he didn  t it would  remind him too much of what he gave up for them  . lindsay finds out through a friend and decides to stop him realizing he is doing it for her . it ends very sweetly showing how his childhood love for baseball has been over shadowed for a whole new deeper love  lindsay . they still go to the games and even attend the final world series game and st . louis and it is a happy ending all around .  thumbs up    ,1
i remember watching american gothic when it first aired  it came into my mind recently  all i could remember was the same guy appeared in midnight caller  which is gary cole  i don  t watch much tv  but i watched american gothic  i purchased the complete series on dvd this week   it  s still as good as ever  this is one of the best tv series ever  the reason i don  t watch much tv is because it  s just rubbish that  s on  except for derren brown  it  s all reality tv or soaps  such as grease  big brother etc  i  m fed up with it  i got the complete series of american gothic for    .   form the asda website  that  s the cheapest i can find it .  ,1
this movie draws you in and gets you hooked on keeping your eyes on the screen . the writer  director is brilliant with the narrative parts and the use of creative and interesting camera angles and perspectives which all add to the gripping hold it will have on you . insomniac  s nightmare is original and refreshingly different from any other movie you have seen . is it a dream or reality  this indie will have you discussing the twists and turns it takes through the conscious and subconscious . it has an eery feel with it  s dark interpretations of illusions . dominic monaghan really became the insomniac . he is a great actor who is not hard on the eyes either  he really poured his whole being into this role . from the storyline to the way it is shot makes this indie one of my favorites . i recommend it highly and eagerly await to see more from this innovative  creative writer  director  cinematographer     ,1
there  s nothing i hate more than self  congratulating pretentiousness . kevin smith deserves to be hung up by his toenails for inspiring every white middle  class whiner to make a movie about why they can  t get laid . i don  t really mind inexperience and low  budget productions but when the writing is this obvious and cloying it really burns my potatoes . the money put into this could  ve gone to a real struggling filmmaker who actually has a chance like john gulager . if you watch project greenlight you  ll immediately recognize a talented visionary who is fighting against the system . anybody could grab a camera and make a talkative picture that doesn  t manage to say anything really  at all . when will we be saved from the smithonites and whedonettes of the world  the revolution can  t come soon enough . go watch a real first time effort by buying desperado or searching out friends with benefits . thank you and good day .  ,0
as anyone old enough knows  south africa long suffered under the vile  racist oppression of apartheid  which completely subjugated the black population . one of the most famous anti  apartheid activists was steve biko  who was murdered in jail . following the murder  reporter donald woods sought to get biko  s message out to the world .  br    br   in  cry freedom   woods  kevin kline  befriends biko  denzel washington  before the latter is arrested on trumped up charges . when woods attempts to spread biko  s word  he and his family begin living under threat of attack  and they are finally forced to flee the country . the last scene gut  wrenchingly shows police firing on protesters .  br    br   as one of two movies  along with  a world apart   that helped galvanize the anti  apartheid movement   cry freedom  stands out as possibly the best ever work for all involved .  ,1
dolph lundgren stars as a former cop  boxer who searches boston  s kinky scene to find out who killed his brother  who was well thought of in the community  however along the way he learns how his brother enjoyed kinky sex and that a serial killer is to blame . dolph lundgren is very good in this movie  in fact on the basis of his performance here  one would forget lundgren  s rise to fame involved action roles . that said the material gives lundgren nothing to work with  in fact  lundgren is completely left out to dry in a dreary thriller which is both predictable and incomprehensible . co  star danielle brett is also good  in fact the film works best when it centers around the chemistry of lundgren and brett  indeed had the film taken the time to explore their relationship the film would  ve been fairly decent . however the movie is lackluster  the action is non  existent  the plot not given enough exploration  too much boring b . s around lundgren  s investigation of his brother  s employer  and the film is needlessly gory and ridiculous . once again  lundgren is actually really good  as is newcomer danielle brett  but the film just lumbers from one sequence to the next  which makes this movie particularly disappointing . if anything else though  it shows how underrated lundgren is  as an actor .  br    br       out of    poor   ,0
the third  and final installment of  hanzo the razor  is the most concrete of them all . the  training  even gets completed within the first five minutes of the film . not for everyone  this film details hanzo  s investigation of loan sharking being performed by an order of blind monks . it also makes a historical comment on the prideful refusal of old japan to incorporate western technology . where the first hanzo film was just a funny and gory ride with little connection to it  s plot   hanzo   who  s got the gold  manages to connect everything  and brings it all home in the end . definitely the perfect finale . oh yeah  hanzo still has a lot of sex  and there  s a lot of needless blood and violence  it is hanzo the razor after all  .  ,1
  atlantis  is a new and right step for a disney feature . it  s a good choice to make a film by such a mysterious legend like  atlantis  . i didn  t have any expectations for this film  but after watching it  i don  t quite understand why this film got so bad reviews . even in my country the reviewers weren  t positive .  br    br    atlantis  is not a perfect movie  but still one of disney  s greatest  even i doubt that this film ever will get  disney classic  reputation . well  that  s another case . it  s funny to think that this sci  fi movie was directed by the same directors as  beauty and the beast  and  hunchback   so kirk wise and gary trousdale are trying to get away from their monster movies reputation  he he  i  m just kidding  .  br    br   well  enough nonsense .  atlantis  is a watchable  exiting and very enjoyable film . even this film it  s a pg  rated action  feature  it  s also suitable for kids  in my opinion  parents who mean the opposite  don  t kill me for writing this  he he  .  br    br   the story is a little predictable  but it doesn  t ruin the movie . the comic book  inspired animation it  s suitable for the film and set  s a departure from the usual disney  style . it  s colorful  dark and detailed . the deep canvas sequences are pretty impressive . the film is also funny sometimes  even i more giggled than laugh through the movie .  spoilers  the characters of this film are also very likable  but unfortunately there isn  t enough screen time to get to know everybody  so some characters are left behind  spoilers  .  br    br   the score of james newton howard is absolutely great . it  s daring and exotic .  spoiler  the most impressive about this film is how they  re making the atlantean language sound very natural  ethnic and authentic . it  s really awesome  spoilers over   br    br   the script is tight and well  written  but still the there are some questions left unanswered in the story . but luckily there are not so much of them .  br    br   so do you  re self a favor  don  t listen to the reviewers and watch  atlantis   cause it  s waiting for you . . .  ,1

the lady from shanghai is proof that the great genius orson welles could direct a  mainstream  movie if he wanted to . by comparison to his other  more artistic works  this film has only a moderate amount of craftiness  and almost no esoteric elements .  br    br   the exception being  of course  the final scene in the hall of mirrors  widely agreed to be one of the greatest scenes in the history of film . it alone is worth the cost of a rental .  br    br   the sweet surprise was the superb acting by the beautiful rita hayworth . her acting during the beginning and middle of the film is so excellent  she made the other actors appear as caricatures instead of characters . even the great mr . welles .  ,1
edward furlong and christina ricci are an excellent couple and demonstrate it with their unique charisma featured in this movie .  br    br   this is the typical  alternative  or indie movie with a plot that features a rare situation that suddenly becomes really important .  br    br   pecker is an average boy who has an old camera and his main hobby is to take photographs of the exotic habitants of the small town where he lives in . suddenly an alternative artist pays attention to his work and hires him in order to expose his work in some important festivals and more .  br    br   but pecker life changes drastically as now fortune and fame seem to infuriate the town  s people who are pecker  s main inspiration . even his sexy girlfriend gets mad because now he does not pays the  adequate  attention to her .  br    br   well this is an indie movie with an edge but not for everyone . it may seem boring or pretentious for some people but still i think it worths a watch only because it offers something  different  than hollywood  s typical standards .  br    br   to describe in a few words this is the typical christina ricci and john waters movie . that  s it .  br    br   oh and i almost forgot to mention that the  full of grace  lines are really annoying . geez .  ,1
this movie is all ultra  lightweight fluff  predictable from beginning to end . as a don knotts vehicle   the incredible mr . limpet  was much better  with knott  s character there not nearly as incompetent or ignorant . his performance there was toned down  with none of his trademark goggle  eyed stare  although that may have something to do with him being replaced for most of the movie by a cartoon fish . knotts made a living of playing the likable imbecile  much as bob denver did . neither really seemed to be able to break out to other types of roles  assuming they were simply typecast . it was probably because of the slouch  the wild stare and the high  pitched voice . john ritter  whom knotts worked with in  three  s company   was able to transcend his genre  branching out successfully into dramatic roles like  the dreamer of oz   but the closest knotts ever got was a small role in  pleasantville .  even leslie nielsen was a bad fit here  uncomfortably neither straight dramatic actor as he was at the time nor deadpan comedic actor as he later became in  airplane   and  police squad .   br    br   there  s also no way the then    year  old knotts could pass for a   year  old  as his character insisted he was . it was as ludicrously unbelievable as tom hanks at   playing the college  age forrest gump .  br    br   the film was clearly made on a shoestring budget  very much looking like a hastily  filmed tv episode . it  s especially evident in the  exterior  scenes of the  town  where roy goes after he  s fired . it  s unlikely even a pre  schooler would be fooled by the mayberry  like soundstage artificiality .  br    br   even viewing this strictly as a children  s movie  it  s very disappointing . it  s not because it lacks action or special effects  although it does . the pace is much too slow  the situations repetitive . how many times can you watch roy getting onto a bus  a comedy for kids should at least sometimes be madcap  with breakneck gags  otherwise you risk boring them  and any adults in the theater as well  . movies  even kid  s movies  have improved quite a bit in the intervening decades . even many contemporary comedies were better filmed and written . disney  s  the love bug   for instance  at least had some interesting race action .  ,0
burt reynolds came to a point in his career where he appeared to just be going thru the motions . he  d show up  party with his friends on film  and take home a big paycheck . it didn  t seem to matter to him that the product he was representing was pure crap .  br    br   no film epitomized this more than  stroker ace  which makes  cannonball run  look like a classic and  cannonball run ii  look watchable . save for a few race scenes there is absolutely nothing worth seeing here . even the beautiful loni anderson hams it up so bad as a dumb blonde it  s embarrassing .  br    br   if the thought of burt hamming it up with jim nabors and dressing like a chicken sounds funny then this is your movie . otherwise pick almost any other film comedy and it won  t be any worse .  ,0
soon americans would swarm over a darkened  damaged england preparing to invade europe  but in     the picture of hip americans in the sunny  slightly ridiculous english countryside was an appealing  idyllic diversion . american dancing star  heartthrob jerry halliday  astaire   on a european tour  weary of the screaming female crowds generated by the lurid propaganda of his manager  burns   is unwittingly caught up in the marriage prospects of frustrated heiress lady alice marshmorton  fontaine  . the tale is complicated by a betting pool among the marshmorton servants that is run by  and rigged for  head butler keggs  gardiner   who  s betting on lady alice  s cousin reggie  noble   the favorite of alice  s stuffy  domineering aunt  collier  . the story would have been much better as a half  hour tv episode . the usual wodehouse plot devices of mistaken identity and jumps to wrong conclusions wear thin in a full  length film . both alice  jerry appear impossibly  and annoyingly  clueless by the second half of the film . the amusement park interlude  the climax in the castle are too long  begin to drag . fontaine is too beautiful  too dignified  too quiet to be a ditzy blonde  no matter how aristocratic  while young footman albert  watson  is painfully awful . but while  damsel  is a pretty diminutive vehicle for so much talent  the talent doesn  t let us down . astaire  s romantic comedy skill is no less enjoyable here than in any of his films with ginger rogers and his dance scenes  both solo  with burns  allen  are up to par  though his one dance with novice hoofer joan is necessarily tame . gracie nearly steals the whole show as george  s bubbly secretary who is at once airheaded  conniving  coolly self  confident . her scene with solid character actor gardiner as the devious snob keggs is a one  of  a  kind classic . this  astaire  s priceless scene with the madrigal singers give  damsel  a delightful color of naive but noble  spirited americans mixing with noble but dull  spirited englishmen . gershwin is at the top of his game with  nice work if you can get it    stiff upper lip   which carry the film through its weak points . and is there another film where madrigals get a gershwin swing treatment   damsel  is more than a piece of trivia for those who might want to see astaire without rogers or fontaine before she was a real star . it  s a fine diversion as entertaining as any of the vaudevillian musical comedies that ruled the     s but will never be made again .  ,1
the film maybe goes a little far  but if you love the show it  s what you expect . it  s not a bad movie it  s actually pretty good . if you don  t like the show  don  t see the movie . it starts off a little slow maybe  but then picks up and turns out to be pretty funny . there are even a few  heart  wrenching  scenes toward the end . after all the protagonists have gone through these scences do get to you . also jerry throws in his opinion why his show upsets people and justifies his show  s existience . he  s got a pretty good point . we care so much about the private details of celebrities lives  so why is it wrong that these people tell their private lives on national tv  too . if they were celebrities we wouldn  t mind at all  we  d eat it up . do we not like his guest doing this just because they  re poor white trash and it reminds us that there really is poverty in this world and not just rich glamous movie stars living in a  leave it to beaver  world   ,1
similar to  on the town   this musical about sailors on shore leave falls short of the later classic in terms of pacing and the quality of the songs  but it has its own charms . kelly has three fabulous dance routines one with jerry the cartoon mouse of  tom and jerry  fame  one with a little girl  and a fantasy sequence where he is a spanish lover determined to reach his lady on a high balcony . sinatra  playing kelly  s shy  inexperienced buddy  and grayson  the woman who serves as the love interest for both men  do most of the singing . iturbi provides some fine piano playing . at nearly two and half hours  it is a bit too long for a light musical but it doesn  t drag .  ,1
walt disney  his  old men put their own     spin on the classic fairy tale of cinderella  which i guess you could say helps form an unofficial  fairy tale princess trilogy  from the classic disney years .  br    br   the plot cinderella is a nice girl who can  t catch a break . she is the daughter of a nice  wealthy widower who loved her dearly  but her mother passed away when cinderella was very young  and cindy  s father felt she needed a mother figure  so he eventually married the woman who would become known as lady tremaine  herself a widow with two daughters about the same age as cinderella  anastasia and drizella . at first they all seemed to get along  but then cinderella  s father died  and lady tremaine  s true nature was revealed  she was a cold  cruel  callous  heartless  mean spirited woman  and she passed those traits on to her daughters  who were spoiled  bratty  and equally mean spirited . anastasia  drizella hate cinderella because they know deep down that she  s better looking and an overall nicer  more attractive lady than themselves  i . e .  more appealing to men   and their mother  lady tremaine  hates cindy for pretty much the same reasons . as the years passed lady tremaine began to squander the family fortunes in a stubborn but futile quest to improve  refine her awkward  unattractive daughters  to call them  homely  would be an insult to homely people everywhere  while all three relegated cinderella to being the multi  tasking servant of the house  abusing her  mistreating her and humiliating her every chance they get  they are particularly fond of increasing her already absurd workload  . that brings us to cinderella in the present  where she has blossomed into a good looking young lady who somehow manages to remain kind hearted and nice despite her abusive step family and holds on to the hope that one day the tables will turn in her favor .  br    br   cinderella gets her shot at freedom  happiness when a royal ball is held to introduce the local prince to an eligible young maiden so that he can take her as a wife  settle down  start a family  etc . naturally  her step family tries to keep her from attending  even going so far as to physically assault her and rip up the dress she had procured for herself  with a little help from her mice friends  the dress belonged to her biological mother  . finally pushed beyond her breaking point  cinderella runs out into the courtyard and cries in despair . it is at that point that her fairy godmother  a short  plump  jolly woman  arrives and provides cinderella with transportation and a transformed dress  after all  cinderella wouldn  t make a very good impression at the ball if she entered the scene looking like she had just gotten gang raped  . cindy arrives at the ball  the prince falls hard for her  but that pesky midnight rule gets in the way  forcing her to flee  but leaving behind a glass slipper . make a long story short  after a long harrowing quest to find the mystery girl via trying on the glass slipper  cinderella is found and she and the prince get married  giving her the happy ending she deserves .  br    br   overall  an enjoyable disney classic . not without its flaws  the most glaring of which is that the prince is little more than a macguffin to help push the plot along  he has very little screen time and even less dialogue  so we never get to know him very well or get a good look at his relationship with cinderella  which is unfortunate since  according to the making of documentary  the prince was originally meant to play a bigger role   and a few additional scenes to help flesh out cinderella herself might have been helpful  there was a song that showed her fantasizing of turning into an army of maids to clean up the house as well as eavesdropping on her step  family post ball to show her amusement at their jealousy  which was cut because walt himself thought it made her look spiteful  . still  cinderella herself is a likable enough heroine  even if she is upstaged by her mice friends  and there  s a sweetness to the film that is becoming harder to find these days . of course  if this were being made now  cinderella would probably put up more of a struggle against her family during the dress ripping scene and would probably free herself in the climax  either by picking the lock herself or making an impractical yet exciting jump down from her window  but this is beside the point .  br    br   and for all those who say cinderella sets a bad example for young girls  well  consider this  at least cinderella didn  t go around getting publicly drunk and indecently exposed  unlike some modern day  princesses   you know who i mean  .  ,1
if you enjoy seeing what must have started as a  hour movie in unconnected bursts of unwatchability  you  ll love this film . otherwise  you  ll just wonder how they could have made such a film from something so simple to translate to the big screen as inspector gadget .  br    br   in the previews for the film  many scenes were shown which were not in the film  and within the film  some scenes just don  t make sense . while the movie is slightly less than  hour and a half  i can only think of one truly memorable moment  and that is just before or during the credits   br    br    ,0
i don  t remember when i first heard about this movie  but i rented it about six years ago  and it still remains one of my favorite comedies . i will admit  you probably will despise this movie if you know nothing about rap music . but if you are a rap fan  even a casual one  you will love the inside jokes and references . one of the best lines in the movie is about the difference between a b and a h i still use this line today and get lots of laughs with it . one of the best performances comes from larry scott  who played nerd lamar in revenge of the nerds  . it is unfortunate that this movie will likely never get a dvd release .  ,1
cliffhanger is what appears to be slyvester stallone  s last action movie before he became such an underrated actor . it  s about a mountain climber that must help his friend after being held hostage by mercenaries that want them to find three suitcases carrying money over    million dollars . it has great action sequence  s  edge of your seat fun and a great time at the movies .  ,1
i must say that i was disapointed with this film . i have never been a huge bnl fans  i find their songs kind of childish and obsessively nostalgic  this is me in grade   if i had a million dollars  shoe box of life etc  . however  i have seen clips of their live show and i really like the improvisational and goofy nature of the show . i was hoping that this movie would highlight this which is  unfortunately  the most interesting part of the show because their music is well played yet somehow bland and not that compelling  there is a standup bass solo in the middle which was completely pointless and boring  despite how much jim creegan was digging himself  . the film does not and shows only a few minutes of it  and you know they  ve had better moments  as in the afgahnistan concert  koffee anan  he  s the man in charge  my name  s steve paige and i  m really large   .  br    br   bnl are kind of like when i went to europe a few years ago and heard that godawfull  blue  song by effeil   or whatever every  minutes  i came back to canada and then a month later that song was all over the place again  i nearly chewed off my own arm . bnl is like that  years ago i remember many a fond memory of sitting around campfires in canada listening to people play  if i had a million dollars  . bnl was a cult phenomenon in canada  and much of their humour has a particular canadian slant to it  kraft dinner is a staple for many students up here  and the name  gordon  is quintessentially canadian  a few years went by where they slipped into obscurity and i was somewhat gratefull . then all of a sudden they become huge in states  and everyone down there thinks they are this brand new band  yeah  they  re brand new  but they  re all in their    s   while the rest of canada is going  oh geez  i thought those guys folded years ago  do i have to listen to  million dollars  again    br    br   the concert footage is not bad  but i would have liked to have seen more of their stage routine  the shooting is not that great  and things like clips from their massive free show in boston are glazed over much too quickly . the interviews are surprisingly dull for such a funny bunch of guys  i think they  re all old and they have families and houses and stuff and have settled down a bit . there are times when they go into spinal tap type of material  where they deliver deadpan satire  then they break into laughs and giggles that kind of ruins it . the interviews with moses znaimer  a canadian media mogule  and terry david mulligan  music dude  are extremely pretentious and verge into tap territory unintentionally .  br    br   this movie doesn  t really document very much either  i mean  it  s basically one show and at the start of the film  they are already huge and have a massive touring entourage  it  s not like we see them rising from obscurity and  surprise  they are popular  it  s a methodically planned out event  so in the end it  s rather lifeless  kind of half live concert  half documentary  and not much of either .  br    br    ,0

somewhere  buried very deep inside this film is a half  way decent movie trying to get out . the only traces are a few early scenes in los angeles  in a bar and a graveyard  and thereafter a couple of pieces of production design . like i say  buried very deep . one of the biggest challenges faced by movies involving the supernatural is how to have characters react believably in unbelievable situations . annie mcenroe  s reaction to being told that her sister  presumably dee wallace from the first movie  is  was   a werewolf is  if i recall  along the lines of  oh  really   . not one of the better responses to said challenge . the non sequitirs continue as the story moves to trannsylvania in search of stirba the  apparently self  appointed   queen of the werewolves  . as stirba  sybil danning is the two best things in the movie . yes  even better than the werewolf group  sex scene  reb brown  s acting  and the oddly simian  looking werewolf suits . the end credits have assumed minor legend status and are available in all their glory  at least until the censor finds them  on youtube . check them out to see why and remember  the whole film makes about the same amount of sense . if you happen to catch this on us television the credits have been re  edited to replace the endlessly repeated shot of danning ripping off her top with another endlessly repeated shot of her ripping open a cloak only this time she has some kind of top on underneath . it  s a sort of absurdity  cherry  on  top moment which defies satire .  ,0
i just saw the drugs years on vh  and i love it . i think it reflects the drug history very well and most importantly it has a strong message to the all generations . there is woodstock  there are joplin  s  hendrix  s and jim morrison  s deaths  there are many many examples of drug use and drug abuse . it completely cover the time line and evolution of drug use in america in both good and bad ways . in my opinion this documentary is well done and i would like to congratulate to its creators because this is exactly what is needed to be playing in the tv in these days . i am waiting for the dvd release . you should definitely see it    this movie is stunning   big time   ,1
i liked timothy dalton very much even though he was a bit young and too handsome for mr r . but i thought zelah clarke too plump and short . this version however was very true to the novel and very well filmed . i have seen  versions  orson welles is still my favorite mr r  though george c scott did very well and it  s a toss up between joan fontaine and sussanah york  although they were both a bit too old for the role . i recently saw a brilliant tv version of rebecca with charles dance and emilia fox . i would love to see those two do jane eyre . by the time i got to watching the ciarin hinds version  i think i was jane eyred out  but i will never tire of those first few minutes of hearing joan fontaine  s voice narrate the opening of the first version i ever saw . i always want to go back and read the book again .  ,1
another pokemon movie has hit the theaters  and again  i  m hearing the same old   pokemon is dead  blah blah blah .  the franchise  s detractors couldn  t be more wrong . kids are still playing the trading card game  they  re still watching the tv series  they  re waiting for the game boy advance games  and they want to see  pokemon the  th movie .   br    br   that said   pokemon the  th movie  introduces us to two more  legendary  pokemon suicune  the  north wind  of lore  and celebi  guardian of the forest  and star of the show  . celebi transports itself and a boy named sam   years into the future  to the present day  where pokemon trainer ash  his faithful pikachu  and his friends brock and misty are traveling through johto . sam and ash become fast friends  once they discover the other  s mutual love for pokemon  sam  s vintage pokeball with screw  on top is a great moment  . together  they decide to protect celebi from the villain of the story  the team rocket agent aptly named vicious  who is hell  bent on capturing celebi for his own ends . will ash and sam be able to protect celebi from vicious  dark balls  where does suicune fit into the picture  will jessie  james  and meowth have bigger parts in this movie than before  and just who is sam  really   br    br   like with the first  movies  if you go into the movie deciding that you  re automatically going to hate it no matter what simply because it  s pokemon  or just because your child  niece  nephew  younger sibling  et cetera  dragged  you into it   then you  re going to hate it because you  ve decided that you want to hate it . that may be  but to blindly trash  pokemon the  th movie  simply because it is a pokemon movie  and especially without having seen it  is just plain stupid . even non  fans can enjoy this movie without having to know every last detail of the world of pokemon . i  m not saying that you will become a pokemon fan because of this movie  but you can indeed enjoy it  if you  ll let yourself .  br    br   unlike the first  pokemon movies   pokemon the  th movie  is being distributed by miramax  who i  ve heard is also working on securing the rights to the  th pokemon movie  which was released this past summer in japan . miramax claims to have some boffo  aggressive marketing strategy for  pokemon the  th movie   but all i  ve seen so far is a feeble limited release  which doesn  t include the usual pikachu short in the beginning  which i was really looking forward to this time . i hope that miramax will see fit to put the pikachu short  called  pikachu  s exciting hide  and  seek   onto at least the dvd  vhs release  if not with a future wider release of  pokemon the  th movie .  i hope that the current release is just the tip of the iceberg for this very entertaining film .  ,1
i haven  t seen this film in years so my knowledge is a little rusty . i do remember thinking that this film is twice the film of braveheart . it is simply more realistic and has more believable characters . ridb roy looks like one would imagine rob roy to look like  messy hair and beard with simple clothing . also the liam nesson has a celtic look about him  he looks like a scot and more importantly looks like rob roy . it  s a comparison which angers some people but compare him to mel gibson as william wallace . gibson is supposedly playing a man who  s legend has caused him to be described as a  foot  giant while gibson is almost a foot shorter . the story contains a little romance  conspiracy and an underdog story . sound anything like braveheart  but instead of a film that cries out  freedom   liberty and nationalism we get a film which says honour  love and justice . this makes it a more interesting film . much like gladiator . the cast is fantastic and liam nesson is a very strong leader in this endeavour . the story is great with how it deals with heroism and humanity . the scene where mary is raped and she walks out of the burning house with a look of true scottish strength is followed by her washing the semen from her crotch in an extreme panic . this is something a heroine in braveheart would never do . overall this is a stunning and almost flawless watch . go and see it   ,1
  written on the wind  is a douglas sirk  s melodrama . douglas sirk was rediscovered by the  cahiers du cinema   fassbinder etc . . that hailed him as a master director  i think that it is because of the sophistication of his cinematography   written on the wind  offers luscious color images and gorgeous decors . but i ask myself is this enough to carry a film  the acting in  written on the wind  ranges from weak to fair  excepting robert stack  he is convincing as the weak  spoiled playboy  . lauren bacall  normally a powerful presence in the screen  is miscast in this film . dorothy malone as the seductress  the care  free  femme fatale  is ok  but she lacks the strength for the role . rock hudson is efficient but vapid .  br    br   the plot has very interesting ingredients . the main characters are  br    br   a rigid patriarch  br    br   his alcoholic son kyle  robert stack   never loved by the disappointed father   br    br   his frustrated and nymphomaniac daughter marylee  dorothy malone   br    br   lucy  lauren bacall   a woman of principles  formerly a secretary and now married to kyle  br    br   mitch  rock hudson   brought up together with kyle and loved by the patriarch .  br    br   secrets beyond the door  a love triangle  frustration  fistfights  laughter  death etc .  well  when i read the story summary on the back cover of the dvd i thought that i was in for a treat . my mistake  why  i  ll try to explain  written on the wind  takes itself seriously and tries to tell a dramatic story . as i said before the acting  in general  is not good enough  the intensity is lacking . there are many strong scenes in the story  but the actors just do an efficient job . i think that maybe with italian or spanish actors those scenes would have been explored fully  they would end  for us  in an explosion of laughter or tears .  br    br   what remains to us is the beautiful cinematography of douglas sirk . for me this is not enough . if you want to enjoy a good melodrama  see  aventurera  .  ,1
this movie made it into one of my top   most awful movies . horrible .  br    br   there wasn  t a continuous minute where there wasn  t a fight with one monster or another . there was no chance for any character development  they were too busy running from one sword fight to another . i had no emotional attachment  except to the big bad machine that wanted to destroy them   br    br   scenes were blatantly stolen from other movies  lotr  star wars and matrix .  br    br   examples  br    br    the ghost scene at the end was stolen from the final scene of the old star wars with yoda  obee one and vader .  br    br    the spider machine in the beginning was exactly like frodo being attacked by the spider in return of the kings .  elijah wood is the victim in both films  and wait . . . . . . it hypnotizes  stings  its victim and wraps them up . . . . . uh hello      br    br    and the whole machine vs . humans theme was the matrix . . or terminator . . . . .  br    br   there are more examples but why waste the time  and will someone tell me what was with the nazi  s     nazi  s      br    br   there was a juvenile story line rushed to a juvenile conclusion . the movie could not decide if it was a children  s movie or an adult movie and wasn  t much of either .  br    br   just awful . a real disappointment to say the least . save your money .  ,0
the first ten minutes of this movie about making an international movie in belgium  are fine you see real chaos on the set  a producer on the edge of a nervous breakdown  the cool has been  director  mickey rourke   the bad tempered star  etc . you have seen everything before  but it  s well done . but then  the rest of the time the film just repeats itself the same ten minutes over and over again . no climax  no dramatic development  no good acting  not even bad acting  it just goes on and on and on . mickey rourke has two good minutes when his character talks about his fked up career in a scene where reality and fiction meet . altogether  that makes   good minutes .  br    br    ,0
i just saw the movie on tv . i really enjoyed it . i like a good mystery . and this one had me guessing up to the end . sean connery did a good job . i would recomend it to a friend .  ,1
i remember this show from swedish television . i was only  years of age and it scared me beyond belief .  br    br   i would love to revisit this series and see if it was just as excellent as remember though i suspect my taste and demands have changed .  br    br   although this was released before alien and a plethora of other space  thrillers i suspect that it has its root in scary movies from the   s and the political climate of the   s . when i think of it  this was a real sci  fi  a movie trying to discuss scientific and political questions about who we are and what we are . the term sci  fi has since then become bleak and come to be the term for any movie that has space  ships in them .  ,1
this movie had a imdb rating of  .  so i expected much more from it . it starts out funny and endearing with an energy that feels spontaneous . but before the movie is half  way through  it begins to drag and everything becomes sickingly predictable . the characters in the office were delightful in the first third of the movie  but we get to know them a little too well they become caricatures  not real people at all . this is the same story i  ve seen hundreds of times  only told here with slightly different circumstances . the thing is  i could stomach another predictable love story if only the dialog weren  t so stale   br    br   the only thing that could be worse is if the characters had inconsistent and unbelievable motivations  and unfortunately that was also the case with dead letter office . hopefully this movie will end up in the dead movie office soon .  ,0
this was the worst movie i saw at worldfest and it also received the least amount of applause afterwards  i can only think it is receiving such recognition based on the amount of known actors in the film . it  s great to see j . beals but she  s only in the movie for a few minutes . m . parker is a much better actress than the part allowed for . the rest of the acting is hard to judge because the movie is so ridiculous and predictable . the main character is totally unsympathetic and therefore a bore to watch . there is no real emotional depth to the story . a movie revolving about an actor who can  t get work doesn  t feel very original to me . nor does the development of the cop . it feels like one of many straight  to  video movies i saw back in the   s . . . and not even a good one in those standards .  br    br    ,0
some films just simply should not be remade . this is one of them . in and of itself it is not a bad film . but it fails to capture the flavor and the terror of the     film of the same title . liam neeson was excellent as he always is  and most of the cast holds up  with the exception of owen wilson  who just did not bring the right feel to the character of luke . but the major fault with this version is that it strayed too far from the shirley jackson story in it  s attempts to be grandiose and lost some of the thrill of the earlier film in a trade off for snazzier special effects . again i will say that in and of itself it is not a bad film . but you will enjoy the friction of terror in the older version much more .  ,1
is seismic activity with little or negligible results on the surface . so in that respect  imdb  s average voting score is spot on .  br    br   a spanish film made in the usa with third or fourth rate actors giving a kind of  falcon crest  dimension to the whole affair is a wonderful way to waste your time  as well as wasting the money of those who backed the project financially .  br    br   the slugs involved are originals from asturias  northern spain  but as they were not allowed into the united states  plastic ones had to be made . however  chopping them up in the lettuce being used for making the evening dinner  time salad contrasts rather weirdly with parisienne music as well as a rather tatty array of other us forgotten hits  or misses if you have no idea who was responsible for composing it  . the actors involved were also a rather tatty array  just suitable for a low  budget film which might be categorised as horrific  horrifying  horrible or just simple awful .  br    br   as a result  the outcome is negligible on the surface  undetected underground  and about as attractive as chapter       of coronation street or the latest news from baghdad .  ,0
i could barely keep myself from either nodding off or just turning off this turd  but i decided to stick it out if only for the reasoning that maybe something would happen . this is the work of a writer  producer  director  special fx  kenneth herts  who wants to make a statement on ecological damage while making a monster movie . that  s what he wanted  anyway . what it turns out to be is a lot of acting  either slightly hammy or just mundane and without much merit  and scenes that seem to repeat themselves as the monster attacks in the river waters  oh  and what luck  a woman just happens to be naked in it . . . even though there have already been disappearances    br    br   this is just nonsensical stuff  but i suppose it  s not too harmful it  s not very obnoxious at the least and once or twice we get a semi  interesting peek at brazilian  culture   which is the father walking through town with his flock or other pieces of a semblance of  hey  this is not america    . but whatever hope the director had in casting mitchum or carradine is squandered on at best pedestrian and at worst excruciatingly banal and dumb dialog . it doesn  t help that when we finally get something of a good look at the monster and the  action  happens  it too is stupidly staged and with only sleazy appeal . usually i would feel sorry for a filmmaker who had a lot of problems getting a particular picture finished  in this case it took the better part of the mid   s  but with monstroid or monster or whatever it  s called . . . nah .  br    br   if you happen to get the elvira dvd double  feature of this  bad print with bad transfer quality  with blue sunshine  make sure to skip this one . unless  of course  you  re an elvira die  hard and can  t help yourself to hear her luscious commentary personally  i  d rather get joel or mike nelson with the robots from mystery science theater on this roast turkey .  ,0
oh where to begin . the cinematography was great . when the movie first started because of the initial landscape scenes i thought that i was in for a good movie . then the cgi bigfoot showed up . it looked like a cartoon drawing of the lion king and king kong  s love child . it totally took away from the believability of the character . now i knew there wasn  t a bigfoot chasing people hiking around the woods for no apparent reason but a cheesy cgi cartoon . so from then on the whole movie was shot for me . the money they flushed down the toilet for the cgi they could of spent on a costume like roger patterson did . his was the best bigfoot costume ever no one else could match his . i am a hardcore cheesy bigfoot movie fan and i was warned about this movie but my compulsion led me to watching this movie and i was disappointed like the previous reviews warned me about . i know after you read this review you will still say  i must watch sasquatch hunters  must watch sasquatch hunters .  then you will say why did i waste my good hard earned money on such a excruciatingly bad boring movie   ,0
this film looked interesting i  d read the book a number of years ago and it informed me that the feature followed the plot outline pretty tightly .  br    br   started watching it and almost from the outset it failed to live up to expectations . in fact  i didn  t bother watching the whole thing . . . utter drivel  bad performances  bad acting and instantly dislikeable characters  that was the point of the film  i guess .  br    br   watching this film left a bad taste in the mouth and put me on a downer for the remainder of my weekend .  br    br   do not bother with this feature .  ,0
after a series of power  outages on a remote island zoo  genetically engineered sabertooth tigers are on the loose and mauling residents of the island . man  the sci  fi channel has made some bad  original  movies  but i think this might possibly be their worst so far  this badly written and directed  jurassic park  rip  off offers all the usual clichs  mad scientists who thinks people killed by the monsters are  expendable losses   characters walking down long dark hallways alone  brain  dead teen characters who  s only function in the film is to die a horrible death  etc .   and  unsurprisingly  no suspense whatsoever . the special effects are atrociousthe puppet heads in close  ups of the title beasties are bad enough  looking like stiff plush dolls  but the cgiwhich makes the computer  generated dinosaurs in  walking with dinosaurs  look life  like by comparisonare just downright awful . there  s some gore  but most of it looks pretty unconvincing . oh  and the death scene of the scientist at the end is truly one of the worst things i  ve seen in years . i couldn  t even laugh it was so bad   br    br   don  t waste your time  this one is just downright bad .  br    br       .  br    br   oh  and here  s some interesting trivia for youthis film borrowed music cues from the     sci  fi film  alien hunter   which was far superior to this piece of crap .  ,0
this movie will tell you why amitabh bacchan is a one man industry . this movie will also tell you why indian movie  goers are astute buyers .  br    br   amitabh was at the peak of his domination of bollywood when his one  time godfather prakash mehra decided to use his image yet again . prakash has the habit of picking themes and building stories out of it  adding liberal doses of bollywood sensibilities and clichs to it . zanzeer saw the making of angry young man . lawaris was about being a bastard and namak halal was about the master  servant loyalties .  br    br   but then  the theme was limited to move the screenplay through the regulation three hours of song  dance and drama . what comprised of the movie is a caricature of a haryanavi who goes to mumbai and turns into a regulation hero . amitabh  s vocal skills and diction saw this movie earn its big bucks  thanks to his flawless stock haryanvi accent . to me  this alone is the biggest pull in the movie . the rest all is typical bollywood screen writing .  br    br   amitabh  by now  had to have some typical comedy scenes in each of his movies . thanks to manmohan desai . this movie had a good dose of them . the shoe caper in the party  the monologue over vijay merchant and vijay hazare  s considerations  the mosquito challenge in the boardroom and the usual drunkard scene that by now has become a standard amitabh fare .  br    br   shashi kapoor added an extra mile to the movie with his moody  finicky character  remember him asking ranjeet to  shaaadaaaap  after the poisoned cake incident   . his was the all important role of the master while amitabh was his loyal servant . but prakash mehra knew the indian mind . . . and so shashi had to carry along his act with the rest of the movie . it was one character that could have been more developed to make a serious movie . but this is a caper  remember  and as long as it stayed that way  the people came and saw amitabh wearing a new hat and went back home happy . the end is always predictable  and the good guys get the gal and the bad ones go to the gaol  the age  old theme of loyalty is once again emphasized and all is well that ends well .  br    br   so what is it that makes this movie a near classic  amitabh bacchan as the haryanvi . prakash mehra created yet another icon in the name of a story . chuck the story  the characters and the plot . my marks are for amitabh alone .  ,1
in film  i feel as though it should be more than just art . i think it should be more than that  a way to tell a story on screen . this short from david lynch tells a story but not much of one . i felt that it was funny but too bizarre to be a comedy . it is good film  making but there really isn  t anything else to it . as i  ve said before  i am a huge david lynch fan but i get frustrated by some of his work because i don  t see a need for it at all . this is definitely my least favorite thing he has done so far but i know he  s still got a ton of talent and i am excited to see what he has in store for us in the future . if you like lynch  check this out but don  t be surprised when you don  t like it very much .  ,0
i thank god i didn  t go to cinema for this film . i would be very sorry for the money i gave . i saw it on tv and i couldn  t beleive my eyes . i wonder if any film could be worse than this one . they spent millions of dollars to this film for nothing . awful acting and awful scenario . i think the other people who wrote comments are the man working from that film company   it  s very big fiasco  in year     can they still laugh at this kind of film  embarassing . . .  ,0
working  class romantic drama from director martin ritt is as unbelievable as they come  yet there are moments of pleasure due mostly to the charisma of stars jane fonda and robert de niro  both terrific  . she  s a widow who can  t move on  he  s illiterate and a closet  inventor   you can probably guess the rest . adaptation of pat barker  s novel  union street   a better title   is so laid  back it verges on bland  and the film  s editing is a mess  but it  s still pleasant a rosy  hued blue  collar fantasy . there are no overtures to serious issues  even the illiteracy angle is just a plot  tool for the ensuing love story  and no real fireworks  though the characters are intentionally a bit colorless and the leads are toned down to an interesting degree . the finale is pure fluff   and cynics will find it difficult to swallow   though these two characters deserve a happy ending and the picture wouldn  t really be satisfying any other way .  from   ,1
i saw this film at the santa barbara film festival  and there was not a dry eye in the house . it is incredible to see not only what a great person darius is  but how admirable the rest of the team is too and at such a young age .  br    br   it also made me think how disgusting mtv was  and how on being given an opportunity to involve and inspire in a positive way  they declined . shows you whether they really care about the youth and their viewers at all .  br    br   it  s a wonderful and heart warming true story . . . take your tissues but it  s great to see how caring and inspiring youth of today can be .  ,1

i love this movie . my only disappointment was that some of the original songs were changed .  br    br   it  s true that frank sinatra does not get a chance to sing as much in this movie but it  s also nice that it  s not just another frank sinatra movie where it  s mostly him doing the singing .  br    br   i actually thought it was better to use marlon brando  s own voice as he has the voice that fits and i could not see someone with this great voice pulling off the gangster feel of his voice .  br    br   stubby kaye  s  sit down  you  re rockin  the boat  is a foot  tappin   sing  a  long that i just love . he is a hard act to follow with his version and i still like his the best .  br    br   vivian blaine is just excellent in this part and  adelaide  s lament  is my favorite of her songs .  br    br   i really thought jean simmons was perfect for this part . maybe i would not have first considered her but after seeing her in the part  it made sense .  br    br   michael kidd  s choreography is timeless . if it were being re staged in the year      i would not change a thing .  br    br   i find that many times something is lost from the stage version to the movie version but this kept the feel of the stage  even though it was on film .  br    br   i thought the movie was well cast . i performed in regional versions of this and it  s one of my favorites of that period .  ,1

wenders was great with million  hotel . i don  t know how he came up with this film  the idea of giving the situation after spt   and the view of american society is hopeful  that makes it  out of ten . but this is not a movie . is that the best someone can do with a great idea  the west  east clash  . there are important things going on in middle east and it is just issued on the screen of a mac with the fingers of an amerian girl who is actually at the level of stupidity  because she is just ignorant about the facts  . the characters are not well shaped . and the most important thing is the idea that is given with religion is somehow funny to me . at the ending scene lana says lets just be quiet and try to listen . and the background music says  . . . i will pray  . the thing is not about religion actually . but it ends up with this . how you are gonna see the truth if you just close your eyes and pray . the lights are already shining on the truth . its just that nobody wants to see it . ps  my home is not a place . it is people  the only thing that gets   out of   is that sentence . but it is wasted behind this film making .  by the way as  someone  mentioned below  americas finest young man are not finest  they are just the  poor  and the  hopeless  ones who sign up for the army in need of good paychecks which is not provided by the government    ,0
one reviewer notes that it does not seem to matter what welles actually says or does  he moves you . i concur . he was and remains a unique force in film . more than a triple threat who could act  write and direct  he had a genius uniquely suited to film . one can consider whether in an earlier age he would have been a painter . this film certainly reinforces that impression . a musician  a theatre actor  an heir to shakespeare  hard to tell but i am very grateful that his time cam with film and he have him captured on film . i like the accent . i like the face  the size  the style  the mind and the games . i love all of his movies and wish there were more . i particularly love how other actors interacted with him on film . many were never better or at least somehow different with him because he was o firmly there . even towards the end when his beauty was ruined  perhaps by his own intent  he was impossible to ignore and he made every scene he was in . rita was a gorgeous blonde   a lana turner look alike but perhaps even lovelier and even then the eye goes to welles and one wishes for another minute  another film  another hour in his company . that is why we all wish we could come upon the lost scraps cut from his films because we know  we all know  that there is not part of him not worthy of our time . watch it and be grateful for the chance .  ,1
no doubt intended as a totally campy joke   full moon high  portrays     s teenager tony walker  adam arkin  accompanying his father  ed mcmahon  on a trip to romania . sure enough  tony gets bitten  and grows fur and fangs whenever there  s a full moon . a particularly interesting aspect in this movie is that he can  t age as long as he has the werewolf curse  and that he has to fulfill a destiny  even if it takes twenty years .  br    br   but otherwise  the movie  s just plain funny once it gets going . ed mcmahon  s character is an over  patriotic right  wing yahoo  he thinks that everyone should have listened to joe mccarthy   kenneth mars  s coach  principal is a tense dweeb  and then there  s more . one of the most eye  opening cast members is demond wilson  best remembered as lamont on  sanford and son   as a bus driver who gets a big surprise . but probably the funniest scene is the changing of the presidents then gag with gerald ford really summed him up  anyway  it  s a real treat . considering that alan arkin  who plays a zany psychiatrist  just won an oscar on sunday night and thanked his sons  i wonder whether or not he remembers co  starring with two of them in this movie  aside from adam  his son anthony also has a small role  . quite funny . also starring elizabeth hartman .  br    br   ps director larry cohen is probably best known for the killer baby flick  it  s alive  .  ,1

this documentary  or i should say mockumentary  is the perfect example of how ridiculous can the people be  when they have full enthusiasm on something like that . honestly  i hate cryptozoology . it is unscience  it just destroy it . however  something positive in this was the visual effects  dragons were beautiful   but some of the information in this mockumentary was totally fake  and that is really disappointing because it was coming from scientists  so that is the reason why it deserves a  of   and not a  . an example of false information would be the hydrogen idea it is true that  according to chemystry  the hydrogen is produced in the stomach but it is impossible to be produced in that proportions  so in that case  you need a good explanation of what really happens in a dragon stomach . there are a lot of substances whit hydrogen in the nature but not the necessary to aloud an animal like that to fly  and the hydrogen does not appear from nothing  so it is impossible . anyway  there is actually something worse  the idea of the platinum this element is more difficult to find than gold  and i cannot explain myself how dragons survive depending of that . it is ridiculous  they present dragons like creatures with low chances of conquering the planet earth  but off course at least that explain why they got extincted . probably cryptologist  s call themselves scientists  but they are not . people like them say lies like in this mockumentary  and what is worst  some people buy them . but i do not think that a person who cares about science would believe in dragons after watching this . those fake scientists waste their time .  ,0
updating of the bliss theme is merely the latest in a lengthening queue of bad  to  average local comedies which appeal to the conservative cinema  going set .  for the record  this list  all of the films on which appear to be attempting a castle  esque miracle  includes  strange bedfellows  thunderstruck  bad eggs  the honourable wally norman  horseplay  the wannabes and the nugget . the only one to have worked has been crackerjack .   br    br   here  the performances never mesh  as john howard doesn  t even look like he  s in the right film  though perhaps that was the intention  as franklin plays sleepy  conservative suburbia against its more interesting inhabitants .    year  old virgins who live with their parents are becoming rarer on  screen  but this is hardly a reason to watch the film . in fact  the only reasons may well be    howard  s bizarre  but quite fun  performance  and    the  suburban nightmare  theme  which has run through somersault  strange bedfellows  tom white  alexandra  s project  danny deckchair  the rage in placid lake  traveling light  teesh  trude  swimming upstream and lantana  many of which are very good  excellent . enter at own risk  may be one for people who titter at the word  penis  .     .  ,0
when evaluating documentaries that focus a relatively small group of ugly ultra right wing and conservative groups like this in the usa you must consider the following . the united states of america with its population of    million and its complex history as an aspiring democracy and its hopes and desires to uphold human rights that it has its failings and downside . it is of course expected that extreme right wing groups and ultra conservative groups exist in sizable numbers however relative to the size of its population they are very small and isolated . on a per capita basis europe  britain and even australia have similar right wing groups in fact on a per  capta basis the actual size of neo  nazi groups in australia is actually higher than in the united states of america . it is for the above reasons that it is unjustifiable to demean and vilify the american people and their level of debate in educated american society by very fraudulently and deceptively presenting this ultra  right wing bunch of psychopaths as being representative of american society . by doing so greenstreet  deliberately chose small and isolated groups at opposite ends of the spectrum to construct an image of america that is an outrageous and deliberate sensationalist lie . this film is clearly designed to inflame and pander to the views of people who harbor this subconscious and morbid hate the american people and way of life under the guise of spurist fashionable and clich idealist left wing ideology . this film was made for profit not for furthering the truth about american society and the human condition . greenstreet can make documentaries that focus on ultra right wing conspiracies  the military industrial complex but fail miserably to present an intelligent and balanced factual debate let alone alternative solutions to the failings of a vibrant democracy . movie show is exposed as anti american by its support for this trash . sensationalism at its worst anti  usa garbage shameful .  ,0
i  m writing this  years after the final episode was aired and i am still reeling from the impact wildside has had on me .  br    br   it has effectively gone where numerous other cop dramas have gone and succeeded . but it took it further and didn  t stray from the realism of the streets  often portraying life events and characters down to a t .  br    br   i am sorely missing this series  instead we have are given the stupid  underbelly  which is over dramatised and acted creating a whole load of american  esquire garbage .  br    br   wildside stayed true to the uniqueness of sydney and for that i am truly indebted to this wonderful series . the acting was a  grade and it  s a shame to see only a few actors have furthered their career whilst others have faded into obscurity .  br    br   i don  t want australia to forget this wonderful piece of their television history  thus i ask the abc to release the complete series on dvd  not the first three . give this series the ending it deserves .  ,1
this movie is cold  bare truth . often we think  oh no  that won  t happen to me .  but it can . drug smuggling is big money and often people are unknowingly  or tricked  into doing things for smugglers . the story of these two girls is the story of many young people who like them  only wanted a exotic holiday  which turned into a nightmare . people need to know that these sort of events aren  t improbable or exaggerated  this is a major problem in today  s society .  br    br   i would recommend this movie to mature viewers because of the understanding needed to truly appreciate this movie . it is very emotional and raw . well worth watching and certainly stays in your memory .  ,1
i sometimes enjoy really lousy movies . . . . those that occasionally result when people  even talented people  get together with good intentions to produce a movie and for whatever reason it turns out to be a disaster . movies like  attack of the killer tomatoes    plan  from outer space    manos  hands of fate   and  heavens gate   etc .  br    br   so  when i heard that this movie   rachel  s attic   was considered by many people to be the single worst film of the decade  naturally i just had to see it .  br    br   boy  do i regret that decision . this movie is beyond bad . . . . it is so bad that it is not even as enjoyable as the usual bad movie . the acting  filming  script  etc . are even worse than a low budget porno film the sound is utterly horrible  the  plot  is completely incomprehensible  the  acting  is laughable . . . . it is a complete waste of everyone  s time and money . at least the porno film has porno to break up the monotony  while this ridiculous nightmare has a guy squeezing a rotten apple  and a  mad hatter  s  tea party .  br    br   the lighting is non  existent . . . many  scenes  take place in semi or complete darkness  which is probably just as well . the  writer  director   i use the terms loosely   david tybor  tries to get kinky with bondage scenes . . . but the results would be laughable  if they weren  t so pathetic . there is some nudity  but it is of such abysmal quality that it actually acts as a sexual suppressant . i could go on forever and not do justice to all the flaws and shortcomings of this truly awful waste of film .  br    br   for the love of god  avoid this train wreck . i know that despite  or perhaps because of  my negative comments  you may still be tempted to see if this piece of trash is really as bad as i claim it to be . . . . but trust me on this . . . . it  s even worse than i have said  and you will absolutely  positively regret the experience  and expense  if you waste your money on a purchase or rental  .  ,0
here we are two travelers from a distant futuristic world arrive on earth . . . one is on a desperate mission to preserve a life  another is an inhuman killing machine determined to eliminate the woman who will give birth to the saviour of an entire race .  br    br   so what could we call this killing machine  it  s almost like he  s some kind of destroyer  or eradicator . . . sort of like an exterminator or something . what  s the word i  m looking for . . . something that  terminates  things  hmmmm . . . .  br    br   anyway  the protector  who swiftly doffs the white tunic he stole from luke skywalker in favour of local clothing  finds the young woman first and impregnates her with a future  born hero  to  be . the evil uhhhh . . .  exterminator  kills some rednecks and steals their guns and clothes  then attempts to locate the woman by visiting her workplace and asking around by looking menacingly into people  s eyes and repeating her name threateningly .  br    br   then begins a desperate race for survival as the seemingly deathless and unstoppable  exterminator  pursues the couple across the countryside . at some point he may acquire boots and a motorcycle  but i  m not sure .  br    br   perhaps  in an exciting finale  he will attempt to crush them under the wheels of an enormous tanker truck full of . . . acid . then the truck will crash . they will be saved . . . but no  he will then re  emerge  as strong as ever . he will kill the protector and pursue the girl into a meat packing plant  where in a terrifying finish  he is pushed into a large piece of industrial chopping machinery  and destroyed once and for all .  br    br   but maybe i  m extrapolating too much . . . after all  i did stop watching this movie after mr . protector magically impregnates sean young by kissing her at a bar  then tells her the child will be born in  days .  br    br   the costumes and effects are great in this movie . . . i loved them the first time i saw them on star trek next generation too  sean young does another great turn as an unemotive replicant  and career sweat  hog stephen baldwin is also on board as young  s fat cop boyfriend . not sure where he fits into the plot though . . . maybe he  s an import from a different james cameron movie   ,0
a noted cinematic phenomenon of the late eighties and early nineties was the number of oscars which went to actors playing characters who were either physically or mentally handicapped . the first was marlee matlin  s award for  children of a lesser god  in      and the next ten years were to see another  best actress  award  holly hunter for  the piano  in      and no fewer than five  best actor  awards  dustin hoffman in     for  rain man   daniel day  lewis in     for  my left foot   al pacino in     for  scent of a woman   tom hanks in     for  forrest gump  and geoffrey rush in     for  shine   for portrayals of the disabled . matlin  who played a deaf woman  is herself deaf  but all the others are able  bodied .  br    br   this phenomenon aroused some adverse comment at the time  with suggestions being made that these awards were given more for political correctness than for the quality of the acting . when jodie foster failed to win  best actress  for  nell  in     some people saw this as evidence of a backlash against this sort of portrayal . my view  however  is that the majority of these awards were well deserved . i thought the     award should have gone to either clint eastwood or robert downey rather than pacino  but apart from that the only one with which i disagreed would have been hanks   and that was because i preferred nigel hawthorne  s performance in  the madness of king george  . in that film  of course  hawthorne played a character who was mentally ill .  br    br    my left foot  was based upon the autobiography of the irish writer and painter christy brown . brown was born in      one of the thirteen children of a working  class dublin family . he was born with cerebral palsy and was at first wrongly thought to be mentally handicapped as well . he was for a long time incapable of deliberate movement or speech  but eventually discovered that he could control the movements of one part of his body  his left foot  hence the title  . he learned to write and draw by holding a piece of chalk between his toes  and went on to become a painter and a published novelist and poet .  br    br   life in working  class dublin in the thirties and forties could be hard  and the city jim sheridan  himself a dubliner  shows us here is in many ways a grim  grey  cheerless place  very different from our normal idea of the  emerald isle  .  sheridan and day  lewis were later to collaborate on another film with an irish theme   in the name of the father   . against this  however  must be set the cheerfulness and spirit of its people  especially the brown family . much of christy  s success was due to the support he received from his parents  who refused to allow him to be institutionalised and always believed in the intelligence hidden beneath a crippled exterior  and from his siblings . we see how his brothers used to wheel him round in a specially  made cart and how they helped their bricklayer father to build christy a room of his own in their back yard .  br    br   the film could easily have slid into sentimentality and ended up as just another heart  warming  triumph over adversity  movie . that it does not is due to a number of factors  principally the magnificent acting . in the course of his career  day  lewis has given a number of fine performances  but this  together with the recent  there will be blood   is his best . he is never less than     convincing as christie his tortured  jerky movements and strained attempts at speech persuade us that we really are watching a disabled person  even though  intellectually  we are well aware that day  lewis is able  bodied . the other performances which stand out are from fiona shaw as his mentor dr eileen cole  from hugh o  conor as the young christy and from brenda fricker as christy  s mother  which won her the  best supporting actress  award  .  br    br   the other reason why the film escapes sentimentality is that it does not try to sentimentalise its main character . christy brown had a difficult life  but he could also be difficult to live with  and the film gives us a  warts and all  portrait . he was a heavy drinker  given to foul language and prone to outbursts of rage . he could also be selfish and manipulative of those around him  and the film shows us all these aspects of his character . of course  it also shows us the positive aspects  his courage  his determination and his wicked sense of humour . day  lewis  s acting is not just physically convincing  in that it persuades us to believe in his character  s disability  but also emotionally and intellectually convincing  in that it brings out all these different facets of christy  s character . his oscar was won in the teeth of some very strong opposition from the likes of robin williams and kenneth branagh  but it was well deserved .      ,1
this film is in no way entertainment but more of a look deep into the depths of the darkest side of human behaviour . loosely linking a half a dozen stories of the worst kind of depravities  perverted sex  greed  violence and intolerance . all the action is played out over a few very hot and sticky days during a heatwave in vienna and the heat is maybe responsible for some of the anger and hate in the film . for me the treatment of the retarded girl by the security equipment salesman was about the worst episode  closely followed by the scenes of drunkenness and perversity in the  slags  flat . you will be gripped and i hope horrified by this film . i hated it but i felt compelled to see it through .     for  fun      for displaying  man  as he sometimes is .  ,0
don  t mistake  war inc .  for a sharply chiseled satire or a brainy comedy full of inside jokes for news buffs . it isn  t .  br    br   this is an old  fashioned screwball comedy  with ridiculously coincidental plot twists  stock characters  given some depth in fun performances by john cusack  joan cusack  marisa tomei and hillary duff  and a straightforward approach to the political content .  br    br   you see  the filmmakers  political points are things nearly all of the country already knows are true . yeah  we understand that the corporations profiting off the war are corrupt  inept pigs  the political leaders in charge of it are even more inept buffoons  and american imperialism has never looked crasser and more out of touch than it does right now   but none of that is the point .  br    br   here  all of that noise is the setting that they lampoon   sometimes in genius ways   as the backdrop for a silly romp  as john cusack  s character  the hit  man with a heart  tries to change his life with the help of the do  gooder journalist who doesn  t trust him  tomei  and the young middle eastern starlet who wants to call off her marriage  duff  . cusack  s sister  joan  plays his assistant with an almost cartoonishly enthusiastic quality . ben kingsley seemed to me wasted in his smaller part as a ruthless cia boss .  br    br   that  s all  and it works . it  s simple fun  but if somehow you can  t see reality and you think the war is going well and everyone involved with it is doing a good job and there  s no corruption and people in the middle east wish our western culture would supplant theirs  then you might not find it as funny .  br    br   for all the rest of us  it was a light comedy with a political edge .  ,1

okay  i struggled to set aside the fact that in selling evp as real the movie was basically lying to me from the get  go . i reasoned that hell  i don  t believe in vampires but i still liked dracula so i could live with this .  br    br   however  even with that accepted the movie is just not very good . it  s competently made and acted  but it doesn  t really capture you at all . there are several  jump  moments  and i just looked at them and thought  yeah  i didn  t expect that  without actually jumping in the slightest .  br    br   also the resolution doesn  t make sense . if the force behind this is capable of doing the things it seems to be  then why the hell does it need to use a proxy  plus  the end caption was absurd . they obviously put it there as part of the  give the movie credibility by claiming it  s all real  thing  but for that to work it really needs to be at the start . but they can  t put it at the start because then they give the plot away . . . sticking it in at the end just made it stick out like a sore thumb .  ,0
not to be confused with the resse witherspoon high school film of the same name  this is a stylised look at hong kong  s triad gangs . called election because a new leader or  chairman  is elected by ancient traditions every two years . two candidates are up for the position and through ego  bribes and past track record the race is tense to say the least . expertly directed to introduce you to an expansive cast without ever being confusing the story twists and turns before revealing itself in all its brutal glory . the asian godfather this is not  but it is an enjoyable thriller in a gangster genre that will leave you on the edge of your seat and wincing at the violence . subtitled volume  i think its safe to say there will other instalments as we go deeper into the murky world of the triads and all their feuding and underhand business deals . either way this is a good start and if there are no sequels a great film in its own right .  ,1
just watched this early bugs bunny  first time he  s named here  and elmer fudd cartoon on the thadblog as linked from youtube . this was chuck jones  first time directing the  wascally wabbit  and as a result  bugs has a different voice provided by mel blanc than the brooklyn  bronx one we  re more familiar with . in fact  according to thad  he  s channeling jimmy stewart  his  shy boy  type personality of that time  . anyway  after elmer buys his pet  bugs goes all obnoxious on him by turning the radio real loud  pretending to die after his master repeatedly throws him out of his shower  and saying  turn off those lights   whenever elmer catches him in his bed . even with the different voice  bugs is definitely his mischievous self and i laughed myself blue the whole time  according to thad  there was an additional scene at the end of elmer just giving the house to bugs after the hell he went through but that was probably considered too sad since he suffers a mental breakdown at that point so it  s just as well that cut scene is lost . anyway  i highly recommend elmer  s pet rabbit .  ,1
this is one of the best animated movies i  ve ever seen in my life . this isn  t just a fun movie  or a well  made movie . this is a landmark in the art of animation and even if it weren  t  just the technical skill that went into making it  would grant it a place in the history of animation .  br    br   wladyslaw starewicz created a stop  motion movie about the secret life of beetles . he imagined a coherent world of insects  with jobs  houses  nightclubs  movie houses  even little props like posters and bicycles and paintings .  br    br   in this movie he tells a simple tale of hypocrisy and revenge . mr . beetle has an affair with a dancing dragonfly  much to the chagrin of a grasshopper but he  s a cameraman and decides to shoot the fling . mr . beetle returns home and finds mrs . beetle having her own affair . mr . beetle chases the lover away but forgives his wife . the two make up and go out to the movies . and the movie they watch is mr . beetle and the dragonfly . described thus it sounds banal  but once seen it becomes a gripping work of cinema . along with emile cohl and jiri trnka  wladyslaw starewicz pretty much invented everything that future animators would use in their work . for that reason he must not remain forgotten .  ,1
i have only seen gretchen mol in two other films  girl   donnie brasco   and don  t really remember her  but she did a great job as a naive girl who posed for pictures because it made people happy .  br    br   she really didn  t think what she was doing was wrong  even when she left the business and found her religion again .  br    br   the photos she made were certainly tame by today  s standards  and it is funny seeing men with cameras get all excited  and politicians pontificating on the evils of pornography . david strathairn  good night  and good luck  played a super part here .  br    br   mary harron  american psycho  wrote and directed an outstanding biopic of the most famous pinup girl ever .  ,0
visually stunning  most definitely . i have seen few films look this good in some time . sky captain and the world of tomorrow uses striking cinematography  computer graphics  and creative futuristic designs to create a world that is historically familiar yet something quite fresh . the time period seems to be the     s or early   s . the movie tells of recent attacks on new york city by mechanized armies stealing generators and the like for some inexplicable reason . also  mysterious disappearances of relevant scientific minds coincide . who can stop them and save the world  alright  it doesn  t take a leap of faith to know it is the sky captain himself with his wisecracking reporter girlfriend always hot for a lead  and in the wings his trusty  thoroughly competent sidekick . what sky captain has in atmosphere and graphics it lacks in storytelling and characterization . the plot for this film is ridiculous . that being said  the film is going for a serial  like feeling of film serials of yesteryear . they had pretty far out stories and bad acting  but none of them  and i mean none of them  had the budget and big names this film had . two academy award winning performers and jude law could keep a film afloat  one would think  but sky captain sinks miserably . despite its fantastic dark look  i found myself wishing the film would just end and i could get on with my life . i had little interest in a story that generated little interest . i didn  t care at all for any of the glib portrayals . paltrow was just awful . jolie was a joke with a role with virtually no substance . law cannot carry the one  liner tradition all too squarely on his limited shoulders . i mean  let  s face it  he  s not will smith  mel gibson  or even wesley snipes . the sad thing about sky captain  at least for me  was that it held so much promise yet delivered so little . i was bored ten minutes into the film  waiting for something to hook my interest  and it never came .  ,0
the autobiography on which this movie is based remains one of the most heart  rending books i have ever read . it tells the amazing stories of two sisters  both who earned devotion and respect working well into their    s as a teacher and a dentist  then lived another   years with dignity . ruby dee steals the film with her perfectly nuanced performance as the rebellious  blacker  bessie  the dentist . she not only expresses her anger  angst  and wisdom well she lets you know exactly where they  ve come from using an economy of words . diahnn carroll has the feel of the older sister  the teacher  down perfectly  but i  m afraid she never makes me believe that she  s over    . no matter   the stories are well worth telling . amy madigan is a bit too extreme and intrusive in acting overwhelmed and insecure in the first half of the movie as the caucasian ny times reporter . this  too  is only a minor distraction . the stories  all true  are the attraction and although two or three get slightly damaged in the translation  most of them make it through just fine .  br    br   i recommend the book as essential reading to all people i recommend any books to . i cannot quite but this tv  movie in that rarefied air  but it certainly captures enough of the flavor to be highly worthwhile in its own right .  ,1
this movie features two of my favorite actors in kilmer and downey . it also boasts the always enjoyable larry miller in a too  small part . despite this i found it to be nearly unwatchable . michelle monaghan may be pretty but she is nearly charisma free and the reasons for downey  s character  s obsession with her character is not at all understandable in terms of the information the film presents or the way it  s portrayed . the ending seems pretentious and though the intention seems to be that the audience should join in the nod and wink the film  having failed to bring us in on the side of its protagonists leaves us unwilling or unable to do so .  br    br   fans of the film say that those who disagree simply  don  t get it  . i don  t think this is so . the plot was not complicated or beyond understanding . it was simply uninvolving and clumsily and obviously manufactured . i  got it  . i just didn  t like it . paddy breathnach  s  i went down  and guy ritchie  s  snatch  and  lock  stock and two smoking barrels  are much better realized examples of the kind of film  making that director shane black fails to achieve .  br    br   i share a birthday with shane black but a look at his credits  mostly as a screenwriter  makes me want to dissociate myself from any other connection .  ,0
i think it took a lot of guts for her to come forward like that . it is unfortunate that when a celebrity suffers that is what helps people most . but  in her case  what she did was remarkable . i have been in the mental health field for five years and i think it is great that mental illness is not a terrible word anymore and i believe she helped . i always thought she was great and always will . i am glad that she wrote this book and that the movie was made . she is a remarkable lady and i hope she continues to act . she has been through a lot and has faced it . i would really love to see her work more with children  especially child actors . her ordeal should not have happened and i think she would be wonderful as a mentor to young people . the movie was so moving to me that i was very touched . suffering a tbi which brought the onset of my disorder and having ptsd  it is good to know that someone has the courage enough to display her life as she did . i believe it helped this nation and people in general realize that there are others like them and that there is help . thank you ms . duke  or anna  which ever you prefer .  ,1
i entered my first comment on this film almost five years ago . then  the ideas presented in the movie still seemed mostly fictional  if indeed they could ever transpire at all . not any longer . now  the politics  society  and media in the running man seem very close to home indeed .  br    br   consider the following factors  which were mostly absent in      the year the running man came out  that are present today  br    br   concern with  as richard dawson  s character damon killian puts it   traditional morality .  check  br    br   entertainment in the form of extreme reality  including pain  fear  and discomfort on the part of contestants . check  br    br   cameras everywhere . check  br    br   restricted travel for citizens at the whim of the government  controlled by a centralized computer system complete with barcoded passports   travel passes  in the movie  and sanctioned under the guise of national security . check  br    br   an increased intermingling  bordering on incestuous  of government and media . check  br    br   computer  generated graphics that are advanced enough to manipulate real film footage  such as the  digital matting  of ben richards  image onto the stunt double  . check  br    br   jailing of conscientious objectors or detractors of the current administration . check  br    br   flagging economy further widening the gulf between the wealthy and not  so  wealthy increasing numbers of fringe groups reacting to the tightening noose of big government civil unrest brewing just under or at the surface of nearly every sizable public event regardless of its origin or intent . check  check  check  br    br   then again  maybe it  s just a movie based on a stephen king novella . but just to be safe  i  m moving to switzerland .  ,1
this is a great movie  most of us have seen jurassic park  where the chaos theory is summarized by telling about a butterfly  s wings  causing a tornado on the other side of the planet . well  bug is all about that  or at least something  don  t worry this is no spoiler  i  m definitely not a religious type and don  t believe in pre  destined stuff  fate  etc  but this movie surely makes you wonder if coincidence really exists . . .  br    br   further more  the acting and camera are excellent too  another prove that it  s still possible to make a good movie without a zillion bucks  ,1
i  m normally a sucker for romantic films which are well  filmed and well  acted out . this is a romantic  period  film set in   th  century italy  but filmed in french with english subtitles . the fact that it is a period film means it will inevitably be slower  paced than films set in the modern day era  so it will bore some . if you can overlook that fact  it is actually a really good film . the scenery  the costumes  and the cinematography are beautiful  and the main actors and actress are very compelling in their portrayals  projecting the intensity of the emotions that are running through the plot . the story is like a sad love story with an unhappy ending . its easy to believe that this is an accurate portrayal of the real  life characters . in spite of the fact that i was really moved by the main characters and the storyline  i decided to check out the validity of the story and found out that the main theme of the movie  s story  that of an sad unfinished love story  was completely fabricated .  br    br   in real life  artemisia was raped by tassi initially  rather than submitting to his advances willingly and passionately as the movie had portrayed . she continued to have sexual relations with him only because he had repeatedly promised to marry her . when they were in court  he had not admitted guilt of rape out of pity for artemisia  s torture  unlike what the movie portrays  . in reality  he had tried to portray artemisia as a loose  promiscuous woman with insatiable sexual urges . in the movie  his sister testified in court that tassi had a wife and had sexual relations with his sister  in  law  and tassi  s character was all the while made to appear as if his sister had been slandering him regarding his alleged affair with his sister  in  law  although he admits to having had a wife back in florence  . needless to say  in reality it wasn  t really like that at all . in fact  far from it . tassi was really responsible in the planned murder of his wife  whom he had begotten from rape . and to add to that  tassi really had sexual relations with his sister  in  law  impregnating her in the process  but all this wasn  t really mutual as well  again  he had raped his sister  in  law before .  br    br   so now we have a clear picture of the real tassi as a multiple sex offender  what do we make of the film artemisia  s portrayal of him as a lover  we take it as an attempt to make this movie into a romantic film . . . that this film was never made to be historically accurate . . . apart from these points just mentioned  there were other historical inaccuracies like in its interpretation of artemisia  s art  in real  life  she was never really influenced by tassi  s painting style  and she was actually considered a much better painter than tassi ever was .  one thing remains true and its the fact that artemisia gentileschi has been credited as the first woman painter in history  and although her mastery of the art rivalled many of her male peers  she had always experienced difficulty in getting enough credit for her work because of her gender as a woman  in   th century italy .  br    br   enjoy this film for its own sake  for it is a pretty good romantic drama  but take its historical references with a grain of salt .  ,1
am not familiar with the trilogy but came upon this film last night on showtime . the film looked very well done with the set design and the cinematography  but the screenplay was stilted and wooden . the acting was fairly bad  thought the two female leads were serviceable . you never really believed anything the supporting actors said though . there were the stereotypes  bible  thumping reverend without a hint of nuance  authoritative captain  hot  headed soldier  etc . i am sorry to say that based on these deficiencies i clocked it straight away as canadian without knowing it to be such  the telefilm canada end credits gave it away . i know i  m a horrible person .  br    br   maybe i missed something in the beginning but the hostility towards the girls is never explained . here they are besieged in a fort by werewolves and the men are wasting time and energy brutalizing two young women for no reason . focus people . there  s a bit more of a pressing situation beyond your walls than whether or not these girls are lesbians  that  s just my inference for the hostility directed towards them . if they can aim and fire a gun you might as well make nice with them . the question of their  immortal soul  can be resolved later .  br    br   also  i guess this relates to the rest of the trilogy  these girls are supposed to be the protagonists  one of them murdered the indian guy at the end that saved one of their lives . i guess one is just a victim of her condition who can  t be necessarily blamed for her actions  but the other is just a murderer who doesn  t deserve her happy ending .  ,0
i don  t know whether to recommend this movie to the fans of  tetsuo  or not . why  tetsuo   because you can easily label some things about this movie as a very obvious  tetsuo  rip  off . the concept is similar  editing is equally frantic and fast  which is good because  aside from making the movie more dynamic  it obscures some flaws caused by low budget and other factors .  br    br   there is lot more gore  less eroticism and  in the case of  meatball machine   the transformation of human being into a creature that  s partially a machine  sounds familiar   called  necroborg   very original  is caused by slimy little aliens .  br    br   these slimy little scums from outer space actually use human beings as vessels for their gladiator games that they play with each other . they infest the body  somehow manage to put an insane amount of mechanical parts in it pulling them seemingly out of nowhere and turn it into a killing machine that targets other necroborgs . their aim is to defeat another alien who is in another necroborg  rip it out of the corpse and eat it .  br    br   all in all  the plot sounds somewhat silly and i didn  t expect much  but at the end i actually enjoyed this film .  br    br   as i said before  this is a low budget flick  but it  s still relatively decent . don  t expect much from actors  they  re mostly not very good  but it can be tolerated . i liked the atmosphere and gore  certain bizarre situations and the way the movie is directed and edited . although the story is not too original  it possesses certain charm  to me at least .  br    br    out of   .  ,1
this is a film that was very well done . i had heard mixed reviews while it was in production and have been waiting for its release  cheers to the director and all the actors . the supporting cast gave eva mendez what she needed to take this to the top . as everyone else here states  the latter portion of the film is riveting . katie cassidy did an amazing job with her character  being she had not done a lot of work when this film was made . she has quite the career ahead of her . i was amazed at her performance . i completely enjoyed the film  questioned my values in life and priorities  and am a better person for it  a great message lies within the film . release it so all can enjoy   ,1
first saw this movie in about      and absolutely died laughing through it . it became a cult favorite with my circle of friends  and we  d quote from it at the drop of a hat   i  m going home in a bag    . needless to say  the humor is still there    years later . it  s become a tradition at halloween time to expose many of my new friends to this film  good thing you can still buy it off ebay   i  ve found that halloween candy tastes much better with your tongue planted firmly in your cheek . . and this movie provides it all  pathos  suspense  unrequited love  nobility and the list goes on . royal dano provides an amazing heartfelt performance as old man wrenchmuller . i remember seeing him in  the  faces of dr . lao  as a bad guy who met a bad end . here  you really feel for the old guy right from the beginning .  br    br   if you aren  t careful  you  ll miss some of the levels of humor in this movie . the creators got real subtle in many ways with offhand comments  little subtle costume digs at other sci  fi movies  and even a scene ripped from the pages of wile e . coyote   br    br   don  t spend too much thought processes trying to analyze a movie  people  this is fun fare without the need for nitpicking  and shouldn  t be offensive to anyone  well  maybe stupid people  but they won  t know they  re being mocked . .  .  br    br    now if you  ll excuse me  i  m gonna go get a  zag  nut  bar . . . .  br    br    ramsay  rc  cowlishaw  karaoke dj  entertainer  ,1
i watched this movie last week sometime and had the biggest laugh i  ve had in a long while . the plot of the film is pretty dumb and convoluted in a badly crafted way . the only plus to be found anywhere in the film are corey savier  s impressive abs . alexandra paul  i think that  s her name  is horrendous as the preacher  s wife who has a history of depression . ted mckenzie is gross and his character  s a twit on top of it all . and as if the fact that you think she  s having sex with her son isn  t enough  they throw in needless sax solos at every opportunity  the end and climax of this film is absolutely abysmal and also laughable . i mean who the hell wants to carry the child of a con who tried to make you think he was your son and that you were having an incestuous relationship with him   ,0
it  s not really about gymnastics swap out the occasional training montages and it could just as easily be about archery  or microbiology  or a booger  flicking tournament . instead  like every other rocky  flashdance derivative that flooded the   s market  it  s about conquering adversity with stick  to  it  iveness  rendering all social  personal realities irrelevant by your lonesome  with love interest standing by of course . ronald reagan top to bottom  in short so as a piece of cinema it  s down to the details . some of the actors are quirky enough to liven things up  especially the love interest  brought to you by none other than mr . keanu reeves  warming up for ted heroine olivia d  abo  s hateful alkie dad and big  hair stepsister are more interesting than the sickly mom or her utterly inert bitch  nemeses  teammates  one of whom appears to be made of porcelain . it  s my instinct to be appalled by the comic  relief black guys  but on the other hand at least they  re in the movie . but d  abo doesn  t quite convince with her awkward  girl shtick  and in the absence of any other narrative focus the lack of interest in the gymnastics themselves really does matter it  s all just bodies hurtling around  and not only is the outcome of the big tournament a foregone conclusion  it  s all performed by an obvious double .  ,0
i loved this movie since i was  and i saw it on the opening day . it was so touching and beautiful . i strongly recommend seeing for all . it  s a movie to watch with your family by far .  br    br   my mpaa rating pg    for thematic elements  prolonged scenes of disastor  nudity  sexuality and some language .  ,1
i saw this movie for  reasons   i like gerard butler and christopher plummer . unfortunately  these poor men were forced to carry a pretty dumb movie . i liked the idea that dracula is actually a reincarnation of judas iscariot  because it does explain his disdain for all things christian  but there was so much camp that this idea was not realized as much as it could have been . i see this movie more as a way for the talented gerard butler to pay his dues before being truly recognized and a way for the legendary christopher plummer to remind the public  me and the  other people who saw this film  that he still exists . i actually enjoyed the special features on the dvd more than the movie itself .  ,0
  the lady in question        starring gene wilder is a well  acted mystery drama that reminds me of the old black  and  white raymond burr perry mason series . both perry and  cash  kept me guessing right up to the end . there were many suspects with a motive for the murder  but i had no idea which character it would be .  br    br   gene wilder has a special charming wit about him  even in his facial expressions and vocal inflections which make him perfect for the part . the portions of the movie which portrayed actors acting was done very well . i  m sure this is an additional challenge for the cast to pull off . i am not surprised to see that he did some of the writing for the movie . even his singing was a delight . i like him in this role more than his former  sillier  roles like  the young frankenstein  and  willy wonka .  i am hoping a  e will continue this series . they ought to call it something like  the a  e gene wilder mysteries .   br    br   the music fit the period . i enjoyed the cool live combo and the swing tunes . i was a little unclear at the beginning whether we were seeing a flashback or whether the action was taking place in that time period . and i do not agree that the inclusion of profanity is necessary to the flow of the script . to me  that always distracts .  br    br   overall  my wife and i thoroughly enjoyed this second in a well  crafted start in what we hope will be many others   just like one of our other favorites raymond burr  s perry mason .  ,1

in what could have been seen as a coup towards the sexual  revolution   purposefully i use quotations for that word   jean eustache wrote and directed the mother and the whore as a poetic  damning critique of those who can  t seem to get enough love . if there is a message to this film  and i  d hope that the message would come only after the fact of what else this ben  hur length feature has to offer  it  s that in order to love  honestly  there has to be some level of happiness  of real truth . is it possible to have two lovers  some can try  but what is the outcome if no one can really have what they really want  or feel they can even express to say what they want   br    br   what is the truth in the relationships that alexandre  jean  pierre leaud  has with the women around him  he  s a twenty  something pseudo  intellectual  not with any seeming job and he lives off of a woman  marie  bernadette lafont  slightly older than him and is usually  if not always  his lover  his last possible love  of  his  life left him  and then right away he picks up a woman he sees on the street  veronika  franoise lebrun   who perhaps reminds him of her . soon what unfolds is the most subtly torrid love triangle ever put on film  where the psychological strings are pulled with the cruelest words and the slightest of gestures . at first we think it might be all about what will happen to alexandre  but we  re mistaken . the women are so essential to this question of love and sex that they have to be around  talking on and on  for something to sink in .  br    br   we  re told that part of the sexual revolution  in theory if not entirely in practice  perhaps it was  i can  t say having not been alive in the period to see it first  hand   was that freedom led to a lack of inhibitions . but eustache  s point  if not entirely message  is that it  s practically impossible to have it both ways you can  t have people love you and expect to get the satisfaction of ultimate companionship that arrives with  fing   as the characters refer over and over again .  br    br   the mother and the whore  s strengths as far as having the theme is expressing this dread beneath the promiscuity  the lack of monogamy  while also stimulating the intellect in the talkiest talk you  ve ever seen in a movie . at the same time we see a character like alexandre  who probably loves to hear himself talk whether it  s about some movie he saw or something bad from his past  eustache makes it so that the film itself isn  t pretentious  though it could appear to be  but that it  s about pretentiousness  what lies beneath those who are covering up for their internal flaws  what they need to use when they  re ultimately alone in the morning .  br    br   if you thought films like before sunrise  sunset were talky relationship flicks  you haven  t met this . but as eustache revels in the dialogs these characters have  sometimes trivial  or  deep   or sexual  or frank  or occasionally extremely  or in a subdued manner  emotional  it  s never  ever uninteresting or boring . on the contrary  for those who can  t get enough of a good talky film  it  s exceptional . while his style doesn  t call out to the audaciousness that came with his forerunners in the nouvelle vague a dozen years beforehand  eustache  s new  wave touch is with the characters  and then reverberating on them .  br    br   this is realism with a spike of attitude  with things at time scathing and sarcastic  crude and without shame in expression . all three of the actors are so glued to their characters that we can  t ever perceive them as  faking  an emotion or going at all into melodrama . it  s almost too good in naturalistic  realism terms  but for eustache  s material there is no other way around it . luckily leaud delivers the crowning chip of his career of the period  and both ladies  particularly labrun as the  whore  veronika  a claim she staggeringly refutes in the film  s climax of sorts in one unbroken shot  . and  as another touch  every so often  the director will dip into a quiet moment of thought  of a character sitting by themselves  listening to a record  and in contemplation or quiet agony . this is probably the biggest influence on jim jarmusch  who dedicated his film broken flowers to eustache and has one scene in particular that is lifted completely  and lovingly  in approach from the late parisian .  br    br   sad to say  before i saw broken flowers  i never heard of eustache or this film  and procuring it has become quite a challenge  not available on us dvd  and on vhs so rare it took many months of tracking at various libraries  . not a minute of that time was wasted the mother and the whore is truly beautiful work  one of the best of french relationship dramas  maybe even just one of the most staggeringly lucid i  ve seen from the country in general . it  s complex  it  s sweet  it  s cold  it  s absorbing  and it  s very long  perhaps too long . it  s also satisfying on the kind of level that i  d compare to scenes from a marriage true revelations about the human condition continue to arise   years after each film  s release .  ,1

i collect horror films from all over and i have seen the good and the very bad  zombie bloodbath is a low budget video . sure  the acting is bad  the storyline is basically a mix of all zombie movies thrown together and the quality is low in some spots . the thing you seem to be missing is that it  s still entertaining and really very fun . the effects range from  like someone on here has said  pasty  faced zombies that look like kiss rejects to really good ones with some amazing latex work . but the reason you buy a movie with a title like this is for the gore and this film is amazing in that area . the effects are very good for such a small film . someone called it a party movie and it is .     fun party movie . i have heard from various websites that this is actually a  rough cut  of the film that got general release but the actual  director  s cut  is coming on dvd and it is very nice quality . i will buy it and judge for myself .  br    br   story is basically a nuclear power plant goes bad and makes zombies . the gov  t closes it down  hides the story and sanctions houses to be built over it . some of the plant is still underground and these undead come up and attack the area . a few actors do a great job  there  s some pretty straight social commentary that is insightful and true  good music  great lighting  some effective suspense and tons of blood and sick gore . one guy gets attacked and ripped from the lower area all the way up  if you know what i mean . then his guts are shoved out of his mouth . another is torn in half like in day of the dead and they did a great job of that effect . there are a million gore gags and it  s almost all action . i say stop being a prude  enjoy life and get more movies like zombie bloodbath and meat market . two great undead epics .  br    br   ok  update    i just got the dvd set and here is what i thought  br    br   much better picture quality and for once i was able to see the actual director  s cut of the film and it is a much better movie . i liked it before  but now i can see what todd sheets was actually trying to do with this one . and the commentary helps too  hearing sheets talk about the film in detail  he knows it  s a trashy zombie movie  but he does show respect to all people involved . also  sheets has a great sense of humor and some humble integrity that others could learn from in the movie field . the behind the scenes of zombie bloodbath is pretty fun as well . i felt it was almost as entertaining as the film it was made for . there are some great interviews and behind the scenes footage  mixed with news stories about the film from some major places like cnn  fox and mtv . over all  a fun little film that is very rough around the edges  but still had me laughing and enjoying the ride  i have seen many dv films  and some shot of video films  and many are quite dull  but this one really wasn  t . while newer dv films are technically superior  they just aren  t this much fun   br    br   ps  i heard they are now remaking this on a big budget     ,1
i consider myself a great admirer of david lynch  s works  for he provides the viewers with absolutely unique motion pictures with typical  lynch  elements .  having seen most of his works  i naively thought i could predict lynch  s next step . i was dead wrong . dumbland is something i could have never imagined under the name of david lynch . still  after my recovery from the first shock  i started to contemplate about this extremely primitive main character  and i drew the conclusion that all the absurdities  cruelty  brutality and disgust presented here are mirroring bits from reality  being emphasized by distorting it . there are things in our lives we hardly ever emphasize  for they are either disgusting or horrible  however  they are surrounding us  so i take the courage to say  dumbland focuses on these bits and pieces . this is not a movie to enjoy  though you  ll sometimes laugh out of a strange  perverted sense of humor  this is an animated reflection of all things we rather reject to observe  with its simplicity  morbidity and absurdity . take it as it is  you don  t have to like it . it just exists . and finally  if you  re attentive enough  you  ll find elements typical to lynch as well . i recommend it for tolerant people     ,1
it is not known whether marilyn monroe ever met and spoke with albert einstein  and since the mysterious disappearance of her diary after her equally mysterious death  we may never know   but in their lifetime the opportunity was there .  br    br   scripted by terry johnson from his own play  nicolas roeg  s insignificance imagines an encounter in a new york hotel room one night in     between the two icons plus joe dimaggio  busey   and senator joseph mccarthy  curtis   but only on one level . on another level  it elevates  or reduces  these  personalities   and what a lousy phrase that is  to mere avatars  the characters are deliberately unnamed   at once greater and lesser in status .  br    br   the title insignificance is both apposite and deeply ironic here  dimaggio  s net worth has been reduced to little more than a picture on a bubblegum card . monroe too is reduced to her constituent parts of dress  hair  lipstick  wiggle and voice . by uncovering their insecurities and reversing their roles  the film brings into sharp focus received notions of celebrity  exploding the cult of personality .  br    br   furthering the theme  there will be another explosion at the film  s climax hiroshima in a hotel suite  in which  the actress  is burned to a cinder in seconds a literal deconstruction of fame . goodbye  norma jean . history informs the script  which in turn  shakes history upside down . as roeg mused after watching johnson  s play for the first time   these characters were mythic  not invented by any single person  not the public or the press  probably not even by the characters themselves .  as played by theresa russell  marilyn  a closet intellectual in real life   lectures a childlike einstein   the professor   played by emil  on the theory of relativity using balloons and a flashlight  while getting the professor to show off his legs  in conscious parody of her own role in the seven  year itch  the movie the actress is seen to be working on in the film  s opening .  br    br   history records that monroe  s then  husband  fading baseball star dimaggio  played by busey as a tenderly psychotic simpleton   was unhappy about her iconic dress  splaying scene in the film  precipitating their break  up . right on cue  we discover the jealous  ballplayer  in a bar  bemoaning the fact that if   i want to see her underwear  i just walk down to the corner like all the other guys  .  br    br   in contrast to the professor  the ballplayer believes the universe is round  a contention shared by native americans . but the big chief  sampson  of one flew over the cuckoo  s nest fame  who operates the roosevelt hotel  s elevator has been all but disenfranchised from his own culture  i no longer cherokee  i watch tv .  meanwhile   the senator  is investigating the professor  who is on the eve of delivering a pacifist speech to the united nations  but whom the senator suspects is a red . in fact  as he divulges to monroe  einstein is wracked with guilt over hiroshima  and what the white heat future holds . yet in a seemingly godless universe  all such worries and aspirations are rendered insignificant in the light of a higher  atomic  power .  br    br   roeg really is the perfect director to bring johnson  s stage play to the screen . throughout  tortured childhood flashbacks and pessimistic flash  forwards  ka  boom   draw unexpected connections between time  place and circumstance  with the repeated visual motif of a wristwatch employed to mark time  s passing  but perhaps also to suggest all time is one time each moment co  existing . as evinced by his back catalogue  it  s something of a hobbyhorse for a director enchanted with the notion of synchronicity  see don  t look now in particular . here      bleeds into     and drip  feeds into the     s  a period in which another  actor  has taken on his greatest role as the president of the united states .  br    br   if all this sounds rather heavy going  quantum physics is surely involved   the execution is anything but  owing to johnson  s witty  zippy screenplay  roeg  s playful direction  opening out an essentially stagey set  up  and the cast themselves  who are on stellar form . tony curtis especially leaves denture marks in the wood panelling as the paranoid  impotent senator  who is seen attempting congress with a monroe impersonator  a real one  as opposed to russell  s   before being let down by his dwindling member .  br    br   of course  curtis once co  starred with the real marilyn monroe in some like it hot  and whose embrace he memorably described as like  kissing hitler  . as roeg commented   everything suddenly seemed connected . . . when the film began to take shape even the actors themselves seemed part of this endless linking .  it all goes into the pot  to be boiled down and served up in new and fascinating ways .  ,1
this movie is deeply idiotic . a man wants revenge for a crime  but when he enacts his revenge  there is a video camera pointed right at him the entire time . what man with a brain cell in his head would sit there and do this for so long in front of a video camera   br    br   just the fact that this script could never even happen except with someone unable to dress themselves destroyed it for me  but it got dumber     br    br   i am thinking the script writers have some serious habits that are cooking their brain cells and making them miss plot holes you can drive an battalion of armored tanks through .  br    br   plot a man seeks revenge for the death of loved ones  but in the middle of the plot something goes totally wrong  and then the unexpected unfolds .  br    br   if only these people writing this story hadn  t been so dumb as to write totally unrealistic plot turns that could never happen this way . to the writers i say  seek help for your serious mental problem .  ,0

i was surprised at how a movie could be both cheesy and excellent at the same time . the frisbee flying saucer was naff beyond comprehension  especially when landing  yet the specially effects when the krell attacked were awesome for a film that was made over half a century ago  living in the middle east i saw shades of islam creep in when jj adams suggested alta should dress more modestly  and as an engineer  was amazed by the imagination used for the  futuristic  gadgets  and gizmos dreamed up by the props department . all in all  an entertaining hour and a half  my first time seeing walter pidgeon and a chance to see leslie neilsen as a  young  man  ,1
im proud to say i  ve seen all three fast and furious films . sure  the plots are kinda silly  and they might be a little cheesy  but i love them car chases  and all the beautiful cars  and the clandestine midnight races . and ill gladly see a fourth one .  br    br   wanna know what the difference is between those three and redline  decent acting  somewhat thought out plot  even if they are potboilers  and last but not least  directors who have a clue . all three were made by very competent directors  all of them took the films in a different direction  equally exciting . redline looks like the producer picked out a dozen women he slept with on the casting couch  and made them the extras  then picked up his leads from hollywood  s unemployment line . and the script . yikes . its mystery science theatre     bad . this is    s made for tv movie bad .  br    br   yeah  the movie had a few cool cars  but you don  t really get to see that many in action  and the action is directed so poorly you cant get excited by the chases  and if the cars aren  t thrilling you  why go to a movie like this   br    br   im in the audience with a bunch of teenagers  and i cant stop laughing out loud . im getting dirty looks  but this was just a debacle .  br    br   rent the ff movies . go to nascar race . go to a karting track and race yourself . whatever you do  avoid redline like bad cheese .  ,0
only reason i have seen    dalmatians was its nominations for original song and costume design for the oscars . i must admit that i was less than impressed with this film . in this sequel  cruella devil  by the way glen close pulls off this role very well  is released from the hospital due to her good behaviour . she likes all sort of animals and locks all her furs away . from that point  we only wait until she starts having crises . soon enough  she does and tries to make the best coat of fashion world  of course for herself and from fine dalmatian fur . apart from glen close  i found all cast quite silly but from a child  s eye funny . that is fair enough as its target market is  i assume  children under   . quite a good entertainment for children and families  but didn  t do much for me .  out of   ,0
i watched scarecrows because of the buzz surrounding it . well  i can  t imagine anyone liking this movie because it  s just bad  bad  bad .  br    br   it  s obvious that whoever made this movie doesn  t know a single thing about horror . the whole story is an unsuccessful marriage of two genres action movie  guns and criminals  and horror  living scarecrows  . when the criminals are killed one by one by the poky looking scarecrows  the two genres automatically cancel each other out because  first  they  re criminals and who cares about criminals  and second  because they  re stupid criminals to boot  having zombie scarecrows go after them just doesn  t work here . where  s the horror in that  i wanted the criminals to die horrible  painful deaths .  br    br   but the story is so badly constructed that this marriage of genres  which could have been original if handle well  never gels . we  re simply left with is a bunch of super dense criminals and a bunch of scarecrows  which are  alive  for whatever flimsy reason the filmmakers thought up . making things even worse is the fact that the cinematography is terrible  tv like  and  worse offense of all  whole bunches of the dialogue are told on cbs  and we continuously hear inane dialogue spoken over disconnected images as if we  re watching some sort of radio show . this part was really bad . the director should have been shot on the spot for coming up with such a stupid idea  i can  t tell you how annoying that was .  br    br   as i  ve already mentioned  the criminals in scarecrows are amazingly stupid . for instance  when someone suddenly shows up  gutted and filled with money and straw  yep  straw  in his huge open wound  the others ask  what drug is he on   after they shoot tons of bullets in him  unable to kill him  he  s been  zombiefied  by the scarecrows . don  t ask . . .  . get a freaking clue  morons . i  ve never seen such stupid people in a movie . and then there  s the girl . i wished one of the scarecrows had killed her quickly because she was a pain in the butt . when she finds her father nailed to a scarecrow  cross   she actually blames the criminals in an embarrassing scene  bad acting   even though the criminals couldn  t have done it . what a dimwit she was  but the scarecrows are the biggest weakness in this very weak flick . they  re not scary . nothing much is explained about them . they  re just a plot device in this plot device filled movie .  br    br   mr wesley  filming the face of a scarecrow for   seconds nonstop doesn  t elicit anything but sheer boredom . and that scene with the talking head in the fridge . thanks for the laughter .  br    br   all in all  this had to be one of the worst movies i  ve seen recently  and i  ve seen a lot of movies these days   between the equally woeful silo killer or scarecrows  i  d rather watcher silo killer again . yep  scarecrows is that bad .  ,0
this was a disappointing movie . considering the material    army life is always good for a laugh    and the stars  this movie should have been a fall down laughfest . it was worth a couple of chuckles  at best . steve martin has been much funnier than this and it appears that dan ackroyd should stick to dramatic roles  where he might follow robin williams  lead and someday win an oscar .  ,0
i am watching the series back to back as fast as possible . i am attempting to watch all things star trek . this is month  and i am now on season  of tng and i have already gone thru ds  in its entirety . star trek is the greatest television phenomenon ever achieved .  br    br    shades of grey  is the first recap episode in the tng series . having just watched the shows  these clips were fresh in my mind  but i noticed how a couple of them were re  shot because the film looked better . season  always seemed real dark and ugly to me  and the actors looked silly  like they didn  t fit in their own skins .  br    br   the show is essentially just made of up a greatest hits of the happiest and saddest moments in riker  s life on the enterprise up until this point . the data and riker scene in the holo  deck is a classic moment of new friendship . my other favorite is when the  nd officer on the klingon ship challenges riker  s authority as first officer and riker beat the living crap out of that klingon . then the admiral kicks his a but good . this entire episode is a heck of a reminder that a lot of crazy  great things have happened already in a mere  seasons with  more to go and a handful of movies  at this point in the series they are really starting to develop the emotions that tie riker to deanna troi as imzadi . up until this point they have mentioned the fact  but they have yet to exploit it . let the record show that the st wiki  memory alpha claims that imzadi means  first  and denotes that she has had intimate relations with riker and also remains deeply close on an emotional one . this episode further proves there will be a tense romantic interest in each other for a long time to come .  br    br   here is the article http   memory  alpha . org  en  wiki  imzadi by this point in the series  production value is up to speed and star trek tng is settling into the sci  fi behemoth it was destined to become . watching this again as an adult i see now what great actors the star trek universe provides . they really need to make a new st show set after all the current shows . a ds  movie would have been nice too .  ,1
after having watched koyaanisqatsi two or three dozen times and loving every second of it  i finally had a chance to see it  s sequel life in transformation . i was truly dissappointed as it did not nearly stand up to the high standards of the first .   minutes of people with baskets on their head is not my idea of a good movie . the philip glass score for this one had neither the beauty nor the correlating strength of the first . compared with koyaanisqatsi this movie seemed slow and pointless . a watered down version of baraka  which is the same idea but done better . i truly hope the third movie in this series will not follow the example of this waste .  ,0
i enjoyed the previous ittenbach movie that i  d seen   burning moon  . but while that movie was rather grim and nasty   premutos  seems to mostly play it for laughs . while its admirable how ittenbach made this movie with no money in his spare time  and the dvd documentary is worthwhile to see this   i found myself constantly battling not to fast  forward to the next gore scene . sure  there  s gore  and if that  s all you want then go ahead and enjoy . but be warned there  s an inordinate amount of lame comedy and tedious story exposition . many are comparing this to peter jackson  s movies  especially  braindead  . but looking at what jackson did on a similar budget in  bad taste   it  s clear ittenbach is lacking one thing that jackson has  talent .      for pretty good and plentiful gore effects  and for getting the most out of limited resources  but not worth the money i paid for it   ,0
corny  i love it  corny  just as the tv show was about   years ago  adam and burt rekindle the same on  screen chemistry that never seems to have left  they re  live old memories  plus the actors that play them from the     s show some behind  the  scenes things which are quite interesting to know .     s tv was corny escapism for so many of us back then  and this dvd is no exception  if you are familiar with the original tv show . the fight scene with the written boofs and bams or whatever is fantastic   the movie theater scene shows clips of the villains who passed away . at the end frank gorshin makes an appearance . he passed away not too long after this dvd was made  i believe  so it is to his great credit that he came back to again play a villain to adam and burt  just as he did to batman  robin so many years ago . he didn  t lose his touch  thanks to julie newmar to re  living a villain role  also . in conclusion i think that this dvd is for great memories  and i wish to thank both adam and burt for coming back and recreating these memories for those of us who remember the original     thanks  guys     ,1
a man brings his new wife to his home where his former wife died of an  accident  . his new wife has just been released from an institution and is also very rich  all of the sudden she starts hearing noises and seeing skulls all over the place . is she going crazy again or is the first wife coming back from the dead   br    br   you  ve probably guessed the ending so i won  t spell it out . i saw this many times on saturday afternoon tv as a kid . back then  i liked it but i was young . seeing it now i realize how bad it is . it  s horribly acted  badly written  very dull  even at an hour  and has a huge cast of five people  one being the director   still it does have some good things about it .  br    br   the music is kinda creepy and the setting itself with the huge empty house and pond nearby is nicely atmospheric . there also are a few scary moments  i jumped a little when she saw the first skull  and a somewhat effective ending . all in all it  s definitely not a good movie . . . but not a total disaster either . it does have a small cult following . i give it a  .  br    br   also try to avoid the elite dvd drive  in edition of it  it  s paired with  attack of the giant leeches   . it  s in terrible shape with jumps and scratches all over . it didn  t even look this bad on tv   ,0
nice character development in a pretty cool milieu . being a male  i  m probably not qualified to totally understand it  but they do a nice job of establishing the restrictive victorian environment from the start . it isn  t as bleak as it really was and the treatment of women was probably even harsher . what makes this go is a wonderful chemistry among the principal characters . each has their own  thing  that they contend with . once they come out of the rain and break out of the spider webs  they begin to interact and slowly lose their sense of suspicion . what i enjoyed about this movie is that it didn  t go for cheap comedy when it could have . it didn  t try to pound a lesson into us . the people who seem utterly without merit are really nicely developed human beings who get to see the light . i did have a little trouble with the alfred molina character having such an epiphany so quickly  but  within this world  it needed to happen . good acting all around with something positive taking place in the lives of some pretty good people .  ,1
this is the first out of the guinea pig series  and is one of the more infamous films out of the collection .  br    br   it took me a long time to finally man up and get my hands on a copy of this notorious group of films . i bought the guinea pig box set and decided to watch the collection in order by release date . so i popped this sucker in and sat down .  br    br   from what i had read on the internet  and realizing the content involved in this film  i was expecting to test my nerves in full force . this ended up not being the case .  br    br   the film focuses on a group of men who kidnap a woman and begin torturing her with the hopes of discovering the human breaking point  and how long a human can tolerate pain .  br    br   sounds like one sick flick right  wrong . the film fails to shock . this may be because i have become desensitized over the years do to my obsession with horror  but i think it is safe to say that any true gorehound could sit through this with ease .  br    br   on the other hand an individual who does not have a well knowledge of this type of film will most likely be overwhelmed and disgusted by the images they see on the screen . though it failed to shock me the film contains some pretty mean spirited and graphic scenes of violence . including the ripping out of fingernails  intestines thrown at an unconscious woman  and a needle through the eye .  br    br   overall i think for majority of the gorehounds on this board that you should just get your hands on a copy of this film for the novelty of it  but i suggest that for any new comers to these type of films that you should work your way up to this one .  ,1
my husband rented this from a video store thinking it was suspense .  he never reads the synopsis  .  br    br   well  it would be funny if the thing was watchable . it simply isn  t . the same thing over and over  no intrigue  and where did they find the leading man  . the leading man  michael des barres  is not even feasibly good  looking  especially for this role he is given . also  sexual harassment at work is something  if you want to see  rent michael crichton  s  disclosure  . at least michael douglas looked good in the early    s .  br    br   alexandra paul  who is usually watchable  plays an embarrassing scene here . there are also lighting effects cheaper than your at home web cam . don  t even waste time renting this .     .  ,0
definitely an odd debut for michael madsen . madsen plays cecil moe  an alcoholic family man whose life is crumbling all around him . cecil grabs a phone book  looks up the name of a preacher  and calls him in the middle of the night . he goes to the preacher  s home and discusses his problems . the preacher teaches cecil to respect the word of god and have jesus in his heart . that makes everything all better . ahh . . . if only everything in life were that easy . the fact that this  film  looks as if it was made with about     certainly doesn  t help .      ,0
this was a wonderful little american propaganda film that is both highly creative and openly discusses the nazi atrocities before the entire extent of the death camps were revealed . while late     and into     would reveal just how evil and horrific they were  this film  unlike other hollywood films to date  is the most brutally honest film of the era i have seen regarding nazi atrocities .  br    br   the film begins in a courtroom in the future   after the war is over  the film was made in       the war ended in may       . in this fictitious world court  a nazi leader is being tried for war crimes . wilhelm grimm is totally unrepentant and one by one witnesses are called who reveal grimm  s life since     in a series of flashbacks . at first  it appears that the film is going to be sympathetic or explain how grimm was pushed to join the nazis . however  after a while  it becomes very apparent that grimm is just a sadistic monster . these episodes are amazingly well done and definitely hold your interest and also make the film seem less like a piece of propaganda but a legitimate drama .  br    br   all in all  the film does a great job considering the film mostly stars second  tier actors . there are many compelling scenes and performances   especially the very prescient jewish extermination scene towards the end that can  t help but bring you close to tears . it was also interesting how around the same point in the film there were some super  creative scenes that use crosses in a way you might not notice at first . overall  it  s a must  see for history lovers and anyone who wants to see a good film .  br    br   fyi   this is not meant as a serious criticism of the film  but hitler was referred to as  that paper hanger  . this is a reference to the myth that hitler had once made money putting up wallpaper . this is in fact not true   previously he  d been a  starving artist   homeless person and served well in the german army in wwi . a horrible person  yes  but never a paper hanger   ,1

my siblings and i stumbled upon the champions when our local station aired re  runs of it one summer in the      s . we absolutely adored it . there was something so exotic and mysterious about it  especially when compared to the usual american re  runs  petticoat junction  green acres . . . you get the idea  . it had a similar feel to the avengers  not too much of a surprise  since it was also british and in the spy  adventure genre  .  br    br   i would love to see it again now   hopefully it holds up . i  ve mentioned this show to others and no one has ever heard of it  so i began to wonder if i  d imagined its whole existence . but the wonder that is the web has allowed me track down information about it . hopefully it will find a new generation of fans .  ,1
i saw this movie at the     palm springs international film festival and it is a movie and not a film since it apparently was shot by hbo to be shown on their cable network sometime this year . this movie presents page as a bondage and discipline fetish pinup and bd stag film actress who had enough talent to become a real actress . page was a little more than that and the film touches on some of her other roles in modeling but not enough to balance out the career of the    s pinup icon . this film is supposedly based on the book  the real bettie page  by richard foster . it  s shot in black and white for that      s nostalgia feel . i have the book called  bettie page the life of a pinup legend  that has a lot of great photos chronicling the career of page and i must say that this movie reproduces on film  with gretchen mol as page  many of those famous photo  s very accurately . mol herself with the bettie page black wig and brown contact lenses is bettie page . not only does she have the bettie page look but she has the smile and characteristics of her personality that came through the camera down perfect . and her body is as close to a replica of page  s as possible . terrific casting . the story is kind of thin and tabloidesque and certainly could have been a lot better . but this is a pretty good tv movie . i would rate it a  .  of a scale of   and recommend it  s viewing when it comes on tv .  ,1
ayone who whines about how this movie was crap or that it had no plot must have been looking for  jean de florrette  . hello  this film was made to be a random act of comedy and in no way involves a plot in any way shape or form . i would also like to remind these whiners that if you are going to flay the crap out of this film that they seem to be missing the point . this film is clearly made for people who don  t appreciate the so called  american humour  which seems to me just a pile of smutty crap . the point is everyone has an opinion and you should be a bit more appreciative that some peoples sense of humour may not be in line with your own before shooting your mouth off .  br    br   thankyou  ,1
what can i say    this movie was so dumb  stupid i thought it was a psychotic drag comedy  they should rename it  bitching pregnant cat fight   what a stupid waste of time  if you want to see  die die     i want your baby drag queen  jennifer tilly being her freaky self then just rent out one of the  chucky  movie  oh ya   the bride of chucky .  it  s more fun watching the two ugly plastic dolls  one of them jennifer tilly turned into the ugly female version of chucky  having squeaky plastic rubber sex then watching daryl hannah being pregnant  dumb  stupid  jennifer tilly grinding up her husbang in a food processor reminded me of my mother trying to do house work  ok it  s just bad     ,0
at first i was weirded out that a tv show  s main character could bring the dead back to life  but then i thought i  d give it a shot . guess what  i love  pushing daisies  and look forward to wednesday nights just to watch it  then for the next week i watch it a few more times on my dvr . the colorful characters  witty banter  fast  paced dialogue  and new unique situations draws me in and captivates from beginning to end . ned and chuck charles  relationship is interesting to watch as they work their romance around the fact that they cannot have physical contact . even detective emerson cod  s character has continued to grow in complexity . and olive snook  jiminy crispies  she cracks me up  the narrator  s voice is fun to listen to and the cinematography gives me the impression that i am watching a movie instead of a tv show . i have recommended my family and friends to turn on  pushing daisies  and they are hooked too    the show is well worth waiting a week for a new episode and if you have not seen  p . d .   i highly recommend watching it   ,1

poor ingrid suffered and suffered once she went off to italy  tired of the hollywood glamor treatment . first it was suffering the torments of a volcanic island in stromboli  an arty failure that would have killed the career of a less resilient actress . and now it  s europa    another tedious exercise in soggy sentiment .  br    br   nor does the story do much for alexander knox  in another thankless role as her long  suffering husband who tries to comfort her after the suicidal death of their young son . at least this one has better production values and a more coherent script than stromboli .  br    br   bergman is still attractive here  but moving toward a more matronly appearance as a rich society woman . she  s never able to cope over the sudden loss of her son  despite attempts by a kindly male friend .  sometimes i think i  m going out of my mind   she tells her husband . a portentous statement in a film that is totally without humor or grace  but it does give us a sense of where the story is going .  br    br   bergman is soon motivated to help the poor in post  war rome  but being a social worker with poor children doesn  t improve her emotional health and from thereon the plot takes a turn for the worse .  br    br   the film  s overall effect is that it  s not sufficiently interesting to make into a project for a major star like bergman . the film loses pace midway through the story as bergman becomes more and more distraught and her husband suspects that she  s two  timing him . the story goes downhill from there after she nurses a street  walker through her terminal illness . the final thread of plot has her husband needing to place her for observation in a mental asylum .  br    br   ingrid suffers nobly through it all  over  compensating for the loss of her son  but it  s no use . not one of her best flicks  to put it mildly .  br    br   trivia note if she wanted neo  realism with mental illness  she might have been better off accepting the lead in the snake pit when it was offered to her by director anatole litvak   it would have done more for her career than europa   .  br    br   summing up another bleak indiscretion of rossellini and bergman .  ,0
you know jason  you know freddy  and you know leatherface . now  get ready for the safety pin killer  that  s right  in killer workout  a dumb slasher movie if i  ve ever seen one  the unseen murderer dispatches his  or her   victims with an oversized  novelty safety pin . it is an odd choice to be sure  the kind of thing that deserves an explanation . naturally  the movie never even attempts to clarify where the killer acquired such a thing .  br    br   as the title suggests  an aerobics gym is under siege by a mad killer and everyone is a suspect . in fact  the movie gives so few clues as to the identity of the killer  just about everyone in the movie is a potential murderer until they get killed . and since just about everyone but the killer winds up dead  it  s really just process of elimination .  br    br   oddly  while the entire name cast is killed off  the aerobics classes continue in earnest . in fact  nothing is capable of stopping the dancing . while three men are murdered in the next room  the workout goes on . death isn  t even a factor one character dies  but is still seen prominently in the later workout sessions . director david prior knew what he was doing when named the movie killer workout and not logical workout .  br    br   cop chases  explosive tanning beds  and hundreds of shots of women  s exposed flesh are thrown in for good measure . much like the woman caught in the tanning bed  i felt very uncomfortable by the end of killer workout . finally  thankfully  the end flashed on the screen . what happened next  you got it  shots of the women working out . not even the end of the movie can stop them   br    br    ,0

von trier once explained how he created such strong involvement from the viewer with his movies by placing his movie world in about the middle of the real world and the imagined world . so as viewers we think we watch a  true  story while in fact we are thoroughly manipulated  often to the point that the movie works disturbing  dancer in the dark  or painful  the idiots  idioterne  . of course the dogme  films acted only as a vehicle for this theory  besides creating some welcome spotlight on von trier  .  br    br   the story is typical for von trier our hero is idealistic  seems to balance his relations with everybody else  but soon becomes the victim of the problems others have created in the past for themselves . the idealist inevitably has to reject society in order to stay idealistic and becomes the terrorist . mankind is spoiled and purity only leads to  self   destruction .  these elements were also very omnipresent in breaking the waves and dancer in the dark .  the movie is also full of cynical  even humorous  undertones about the role of the germans and americans in post  war germany .  br    br   as a technical achievement the movie is wonderfully designed shifting and fading washed  out colors  screen overlays  action on different overlays  with the shooting of the soon  to  be mayor as the most interesting  . in this movie we can see how good von trier  s handles film as a technical medium . in his later works he seems to step down from this  as if he is not longer interested in technical achievements because they become so easily available  .  ,1
for fans of     s hammer type horror films  this movie should be a treat . the only thing i didn  t like about the film was the fact that peter cushing was wasted on the worst episode . in general  however  this is a solid  spooky little movie . if this is not amicus  best film  it  s certainly one of them . the best episode  rightfully saved for last  is the one featuring jon pertwee as a horror film actor   it is really excellent . as good as pertwee was in this role  it  s hard to believe he didn  t do more of these types of movies . all in all  this is an entertaining movie  which scared the heck out of me as a child  and which still gives me the creeps to this day .  ,1

i thought that this was an absolutely charming movie centering around the lives of mary  kate  s and ashley  s characters sam and emma stanton  they are both trying to make both themselves and their parents happy but unfortunately  it  s just not that easy for them to actually do  i thought that this was an utterly charming and sweet movie and if you are a real fan of these marvelous young ladies then i  m sure that you  ll agree with me here  if you haven  t seen this movie yet then i say you really missed  out big time  and that you should definitely take the time out to see it now  this movie is a real winner  sincerely  rick morris  ,1
i saw this movie when i was a child . it blew me away . this was before the days of television  so a movie of this magnitude  could send a young kid into orbit . it so impressed me  that i went to see this movie for twelve consecutive days . the special effects used at this time were far ahead of its  time . sabu was a real delight  as was rex ingram as the genie . i found myself singing  i want to be a sailor  for months after the film left town . i would recommend this movie to any and everyone . i forgot to mention conrad veidt  who was as villainous a character as you  d ever want to meet . also  june duprez was never lovelier than she was in this picture . the color was outstanding . give this movie an aaa   ,1
previously  i wrote that i loved  titanic   cried at its ending  many times over   and i  m a guy in his    s . i also wondered about why this great movie  which won so many awards and was applauded by so many critics  was given only a  .  rating by imdb . com users .  br    br   well  i looked at the breakdown of the user ratings . while   .   of all votes gave it a   rating    .   gave it a  rating . these   .   of these irrational imdb users  in effect  pulled the overall rating down to  .  .  br    br   in my previous comments  i blamed this very unusual voting pattern  a sudden surge in  ratings  with a high   rating  dropping only gradually and then suddenly reversing course and jumping at the  rating level  on only one thing hatred for leonardo dicaprio . believe me  i  ve tuned into enough chat rooms to see the banter by young people  young men  mostly   who defame him left and right . they absolutely hate the man  and they will have no part in giving him any credit in  titanic  .  to answer one other user i am not talking about someone who just really doesn  t like the movie that much  and gave it a  or a   etc . everyone has  and is entitled to  his  her own taste . but no one can convince me that the imdb rating of only  .  overall for  titanic   pulled to that level by an inordinate number of ridiculous  ratings  is a fair reflection of the overall motion picture .   br    br   let me demonstrate my point by comparing the imdb user voting pattern of  titanic  to  randomly chosen box office and critical  bombs   there are many more  but these  will prove my point  .  heaven  s gate        was pulled from the theaters quickly after a very poor box office showing  and imdb voters  ratings were   .     ratings and  .    ratings  overall rating of  .   .  big top pee  wee        got  .     ratings and  .    ratings  overall rating of  .   .  cat people        got  .     ratings and  .    ratings  overall rating of  .   .  blind date        got  .     ratings and  .    ratings  overall rating of  .   .  jumpin  jack flash        got  .     ratings and  .    ratings  overall rating of  .   . what do all of these films have in common with  titanic   all of the percentages of their  ratings are lower     than  titanic   and none of these stinkers ever was nominated for a single award . again   titanic  got   .    ratings  compare that to the other  movies i just mentioned .  br    br   can there be any explanation other than the hatred of leo factor   br    br    ,1
this has to be the worst  and i mean worst biker movie ever made  and that  s saying a lot because the line of stinkers is long and smelly   br    br   now at least we know what happened to ginger after she was rescued from gilligan  s island  a frightened looking tina louise  she was probably afraid someone would see this mess   is a stranded motorist who is tormented by the most repulsive motorcycle gang in film history . but  don  t worry fans  batman  i mean adam west as a hick  town doctor comes to the rescue  pow  crush  boom  holy toledo batman   br    br   the only good points of this  bomb  are some cute women  some laughable fight scenes  and the still  sexy  tina louise   ,0
although i am inclined to agree with the other comments made by people who have seen this movie  i am ashamed to say i rather like it . not often can such a huge pile of   s pap be found outside of a wham  video  so it is most definitely worth a viewing    .   a night in my local store   . watch out for the insanely obvious seams and zip on the monster  s costume  the fact that the  hero  looks a lot like keith chegwin and such classic lines as the following evil wizard  type bloke  at last we meet kor . . .  kor  thrilling  isn  t it    br    br   amazing   i also like the fact that although the video box looks quite exciting with images of a castle surrounded by raging seas and a dangerous falcon  like bird carrying a handsome hero to safety  among other such  interesting and engaging  suggestions of what goes on in the actual film  none of them actually happen . no  i  m not joking . . . there really isn  t a raging sea or a ferocious bird  it  s just trying to make you interested . . . classic in my opinion . this film gets   for pure entertainment value    ,1
considered by almost all the critics to be the best of the johnny weissmuller tarzan films  i have no argument with that  although there are a couple of others i thought just as entertaining . one thing it  s the longest of the series that i  ve seen at    minutes . i  ve only seen six of them but this was longer than i  m used to and with the drawn  out action finale i thought the whole thing was a bit too long .  br    br   nonetheless  it is a good mixture of action  suspense and romance . the only things missing are color and stereo sound . the primitive special  effects don  t bother me  as that was all that they had back in the     s .  br    br   among some  this film is most noted for one thing skin   jane  never wore anything this skimpy after this film as the hays  code was instituted by the time the next tarzan film was made . her outfit showed what a great figure maureen o  sullivan possessed . the nude underwater scene  however  was not her  by a longshot . the woman under the water didn  t have a good figure at all  whoever it was .  br    br   there is plenty of action in here . up to the finale  it was not overdone  either . the ending went on for   minutes  though  and was so intense that it was almost too much to watch .  br    br   still  this movie offers about everything  except  boy   their adopted son   you  d want to see in a tarzan film  even o  sullivan doing her tarzan yell about a dozen times . with her pair of  lungs   that was no problem .  ,1
in order to avoid confusion  let me clarify a couple of points i am not a red neck . i am not even a moderate nor a conservative . quite on the contrary  i am a radical a libertarian . i  m not a wasp either  i was not even born in the states .  br    br   jorge luis borges used to say that there are some kind of folk who do not feel poetry  and that these sad people usually earn their living teaching poetry . this movie was made by and for people who do not feel poetry  by and for show  offs and i dare say  by and for people who have no sense of decency or  for that matter  respect for other people  s life or death  especially when the victims are thought to be mostly  bloody imperialists  killed in yankee soil .  i even find the original marketing idea of the eleven episodes of eleven minutes  nine seconds and one frame as particularly hideous and repulsive . just plain awful . why didn  t they assign a budget of as many dollars per episode as individuals were brutally murdered in the attack  the whole idea rests somewhere between mere stupidity and reckless fascism . anybody who is serious about film  making  and serious about life and death  should have angrily declined to participate in this recollection of innuendoes and non  sequiturs . with two exceptions the episode of burkina faso   almost amusing    and the one from india   which documents the story of a man who was unfairly and wrongly investigated in relation to the attack  on the basis that afterwards he didn  t return home and that he was an american muslim  and  truth be told  when the facts were known he was honored as a hero  . all other nine episodes  essentially and extremely boring and emotionless  can be listed in two different categories  br    br   first  i don  t care about the thousands of victims americans  foreigners  children  youngsters  adults  old  timers . . .  and can be resumed in pure boredom and lack of emotion . makhmalbaf  s  iran   lelouch  s  france   i  m afraid i  m going to commit an heresy since it  s lelouch  s  but maybe  his episode might be considered built upon an idea which could be regarded as almost original tanovic  s  bosnia  herzegovina   gonzalez inarritu  s  mexico   gita  s  israel   penn  s  usa   br    br   second  the bloody yankees deserve it  . and can be resumed in frustration and hatred . chahine  egypt  vindicates the suicide bombers loach  uk  considers the     reckless attacks were some kind of punishment for the alleged support of the usa to the chilean dictatorship headed by the serial  killer augusto pinochet  in fact someone should inform mr . loach that the victims of pinochet were not related to al  qaida and that chile is a south american country which sole existence mr . bin laden should have ignored  he ought to be informed too that the american government sanctions against the chilean dictatorship were harder than any other ciountrie  s and  imamura  japan  windingly points out that wwii is related the attack to the wtc . imamura has at least been coherent in this the supposed cause effect linking is entirely nonsensical  which plays well with his episode including a man who believes himself to be a snake . it pretends to be obscure . it is  instead  quite ludicrous .  br    br   there  s some kind of error shared by many  including some americans  and it consists in the belief that this movie wasn  t commercially screened in the states because of some kind of censorship . nothing further from the truth this movie wasn  t screened in the states because it is a complete fiasco . a fiasco of the wackyest kind . even in buenos aires  where peronism and other forms of fascism are nearest and dearest to the hearts of a sizable number of its inhabitants  and anti  americanism is in vogue  the movie was screened in living rooms hurriedly converted into theaters  and was applauded by a very select public the usual sad few who routinely lend their applause to other equally  quaint  spectacles . like the sight of a mcdonald  s fast  food restaurant or  perchance  an elderly jew  being burnt to ashes .  ,0
i was in a bad frame of mind when i first saw this movie . for some reason it clicked on all my levels  tensions in a family  loneliness and the want of someone to share your life with . it didn  t hurt that the someone to share your life with was such a beautiful girl as claire  cyndy preston  . i also bought the sound track to this movie  very hard to get  . loved it and hope it will someday come out on dv  ,1
my first question after seeing this film was   why is the title liam   if the intent was to tell a story from the boy  s perspective  it was not carried out well . of course there was the formulaic use of camera angles in the boy  s scenes  but much of the crucial action took place outside of his field of view . having a  main  character unable to speak  obviously suggesting the mute  powerless position of a child  makes it difficult to give that character much depth .  br    br   melodrama is defined as  dramatic or other literary work characterized by the use of stereotyped characters  exaggerated emotions and language  simplistic morality  and conflict  liam fits this definition to a t . the viewer is hit over the head with the typical stereotypes of the fire and brimstone catholic church in the stern school marm and the well  fed priest squeezing money from parishioners .  a stereotype which is becoming very tiresome .  what  s more   the jewish characters are money lenders and factory owners   br    br   much of the film was predictable . . . who didn  t think that we  d see theresa scrubbing the toilet after her mother had told her  no daughter of mine will scrub another woman  s toilet   i  m a fan of british realism if it  s done well . in my opinion  liam is not .  br    br    ,0
this is a good family show with a great cast of actors . it  s a nice break from the reality show blitz of late . there is nothing else quite like it on television right now either  unless you count joan of arcadia as being similar because it has a teen lead character too . anyway  clubhouse is worth a look because jeremy sumpter gives the main character  pete young  a kind of likability and naivet that is appealing without being overly sweet and cuddly . dean cain  christopher lloyd  mare winningham and kirsten storms round out the rest of the main cast members  and each is terrific in their role . i really like kirsten storms as pete  s sister betsy she is quite a pill  but she still cares about her mom and brother  even though she hates to show it . it may take a few episodes to really find it  s legs  but clubhouse is easily one of the best shows to come along in a good long while  so check it out people   you  ll be glad you did   ,1
i watched this film because i noticed that it had kari wuhrer in the cast . i have long had a theory about her  that she is a talented actress  but never seems to get to prove that  because she is always in this sort of low  budget b movie . she is still beautiful  and she is still trying to act over the unfortunate material i always see her in . this is no different . the film is often ugly and disturbing  but that doesn  t make it good . george wendt played against type  and that was so jarring that he gets recognition for his role . another note about ms . wuhrer . her breasts seem to have shrunk markedly since i saw her last . perhaps reduction surgery  or  more likely  removal of implants . this not a bad thing . she still looks great . i would like to see her in a better movie .  ,0
i was really hoping that this would be a funny show  given all the hype and the clever preview clips . and talk about hype  i even heard an interview with the show  s creator on the bbc world today  a show that is broadcast all over the world .  br    br   unfortunately  this show doesn  t even come close to delivering . all of the jokes are obvious  the kind that sound kind of funny the first time you hear them but after that seem lame  and they are not given any new treatment or twist . all of the characters are one  dimensional . the acting is  well  mediocre  i  m being nice  . it  s the classic cbc recipe  one that always fails .  br    br   if you  re muslim i think you would have to be stupid to believe any of the white characters  and if you  re white you  d probably be offended a little by the fact that almost all of the white characters are portrayed as either bigoted  ignorant  or both . not that making fun of white people is a problem  most of the better comedies are rooted in that . it  s only a problem when it isn  t funny  as in this show .  br    br   canada is bursting with funny people  so many that we export them to hollywood on a regular basis . so how come the producers of this show couldn  t find any   ,0
 . . . . may seem far fetched . . . . but there really was a real life story . . of a man who had an affair with a woman  who found out where he and his new wife were staying   and she killed the wife   making it look like a murder rape . . . . . . .  br    br   in her delusion she had told everyone that the man had asked her to marry him . . so she quit her job in wisconsin . . . and moved to minnesota . . . . . . . . . .  br    br   last i heard she was in a mental institution  security prison . . . .  br    br   she was still wearing the  engagement ring .  that she has purchased for herself . . . and had told everyone that he had bought it for her .  br    br   the events took place in a small town in wisconsin        and the murder happened in minnesota . . . . . .  br    br   there even was a feature story in  people  magazine . . . spring of      i want to say on page   . i remember this as i was in college at the time   and a colleague of mine had met the individual in the security hospital . . . .  ,0
the excruciatingly slow pace of this film was probably the director  s express intention  in order to convey what life was like growing up as a village teen in china . however  i found the combination of the glacially slow  plot  and the general filming style so impersonal as to be totally alienating  particularly to a western audience . at times i actually had trouble telling some characters apart  as they were filmed from such a distance . two hours in and i was totally past caring . as someone who is not only interested in music but is also very into the history and culture of china  and is by the way no stranger to chinese cinema   i couldn  t engage with a single character and found nothing to get my teeth into . it begs the question if i disliked it  who on earth would like it  give me zhang yimou  give me chen kaige . give me the work of just about any other chinese director i  ve ever seen . this sorry effort just doesn  t measure up at all . i  d be sorry to see chinese cinema judged against this benchmark .  ,0

in      paperhouse was hailed as a  thinking man  s horror film .  wow  you might say  sign me up . this thing is a mess . it features a one time young actress who has a range of like  to  . g . headley with a bad british  dubbed  accent  and a story with no chills  thrills or spills .  br    br   it isn  t even interesting psycho  babble . one will only laugh at its cheap effects and long for a showing of leprechaun  .  br    br   the story involves a girl with glandular fever who escapes in her dreams . what you get isn  t good horror  art house or even a decent after  school special . i found myself after the two hour point saying . . where did my two hours go .  br    br   the direction is uninspired and i wished it could even be pretentious . . . something interesting . . it seems like the producers were on lithium .  br    br   even in the dream world things are boring .  br    br   a short no on this one .  ,0
this is the biggest piece of crap ever . it looks like they spent more time  effort  and money making the dvd cover than they did on the actual movie . i really thought the dvd had been switched out with someone  s homemade porno until i recognized one of the actors from the cover . this movie looks like someone made it with a hundred bucks and a camcorder and they spent half of that on rats . the picture is really clear  but that  along with the very unfortunate lighting  cinematography  if you can call it that  production  acting  if that is actually what they are doing  and script  if they had one  makes this movie look worse than an old porno . at least the old porno has a point . this just looks like some peta members got together and decided to make a really disturbing  pointless psa about animals rights and feelings . this is so not worth the money or the time . it has nothing in common with the actual btk serial killer other than the name of the killer and that of some of the victims . the people who made this movie should be glad he  s not still free  or he might have come after them just for screwing up this movie so bad .  ,0
in order to hold the public  s attention for three hours  we were treated not so much to a family  s romp through four generations and    years of hungarian history  as to sexual liaisons with a sister  a sister  in  law and other adulteries . oh yes  there was also a totally gratuitous rape . having said all this  the first story of the relationship among the children of the patriarch was fresh and sensual  thanks to jennifer ehle .  ,0
maddy  debbie rochon  is a mentally unstable young woman with a troubled past who gets more than she bargained for when she goes to a pool party with a handsome coworker . when her date and his friends jokingly say they belong to a murder club   maddy takes it seriously and moves straight up to level   by bashing in the brains of a woman in a parking garage  for denting her car   . but is maddy also the one donning a plastic mask and killing off other members of the group or has someone else lost it   br    br   the plot of this film  originally titled make  em bleed  is very poorly conceived  full of holes and spirals completely out of control before a ludicrous  out  of  left  field twist ending . some of the dialogue is downright laughable . i didn  t have a problem with rochon  s performance  but the supporting cast was atrocious . however  i managed to sit through this full moon release thoroughly entertained . there  s plenty of skin and blood and it  s the perfect type of flick to sit around with a group of your buddies and pick apart . horror fans may also enjoy the cameos from brinke stevens and lloyd kaufman  as debbie  s parents  and julie strain  an early victim  .  br    br   score  out of    ,0
as with that film we follow the implausible if always engaging adventures of the  lead characters . but whilst c  j eschew sex for a girly trip back into childhood  this pair revel in their carnality even to the point of exploring homoeroticism . most of the sex they acquire from grudging or unwilling partners and yet  despite their deeply un  pc behaviour  everyone emerges smiling . like c  g  through it all they remain innocents at heart  rebels against the quotidien  the bourgeois  the restrictive . as someone else has commented  i wouldn  t want to know these  and it  s a minor miracle that their trip brings scenes of mostly comedy and very little tragedy  and what there is of that cannot be laid at their door  and thus for that reason  it left me beguiled but with a sweet taste in the mouth . dare i say that only the french can get away with films like this . and that is part of their genius .  ,1
this film contains more action before the opening credits than are in entire hollywood films of this sort . this film is produced by tsui hark and stars jet li . this team has brought you many worthy hong kong cinema productions  including the once upon a time in china series . the action was fast and furious with amazing wire work . i only saw the wires in two shots . aside from the action  the story itself was strong and not just used as filler . to find any other action films to rival this you must look for a hong kong cinema outlet in your area . they are really worth checking out and usually never disappoint .  ,1
absolutely the most boring movie i have ever spent my money on . this was a wrong choice for all these great stars to waste their reputations on . boring  boring  boring  each character was portrayed in a less than inspirational way . no acting talent shown  just reading a part . alec can play realistic characters normally  gwynyth made herself look ugly for an unrewarding part  annette needs advise on how to pick the movies she chooses to play in as do all these big stars who have left me disappointed at the way they have all allowed their talents to be smothered in a feature that leaves much to be desired in entertainment .  running with scissors  leads the public to anticipate great acting in a film that suggests experiencing tension and deep emotion . there was not one moment when the cast was able to portray any interpretation of this onto the screen . maybe it was the director  s fault     whatever .  ,0
anyone who finds this film boring is a hopeless bonehead who should stick to car chase movies and romantic comedies . this film is riveting and doesn  t have a boring moment . why  because it is comprised largely of intelligent dialogue between real people in a moment of crisis and details their efforts to survive that crisis . i repeat   intelligent dialogue  that is what characterizes nearly all of rohmer  s films  and that is why a lot of people don  t like them . they prefer action . fine  let them spend the rest of their lives watching action films  while those of us with taste and discrimination will continue to seek out films like this .  br    br   rohmer has always been accused of being  talky .  well  he is  but to me that  s a compliment  not a criticism . shakespeare was talky  too . is there a talkier play than  hamlet   whenever the subject  or theme  of a work of art consists of ideas and conflicts over values  there must of necessity be a discussion of these ideas and values  an that is largely what this film is all about . aristocracy and noble birth vs . egalitarianism loyalty to old friends that is put to the ultimate test when that friend takes what we believe to be a wrong path the value of human life and the responsibility to help save that life  even if the person possessing that life is not so nice  or even despicable .  anyone ever hear of dostoyevsky  or  crime and punishment    these are what this film is all about .  br    br   the two leads in this film are impeccable  as if they were born to play these roles . lucy russell  who is english and speaks french as her second language  is especially brilliant . do yourself a favor and see this riveting film . it may be the last film by this screen master .  ,1
sort of like a very primitive episode of  general hospital  set in a natal ward  and one for tough cases at that   this fast  moving programmer has a satisfying emotional impact   mainly because eric linden  as the distraught young husband in the main plot  is so palpably a wreck  and with such good reason . his expectant wife  loretta young  is brought to the ward at the beginning of a    year prison sentence for offing a lecher who probably had it coming to him ms . young  as always  doesn  t do anything to disinvite audience sympathy  and she  s a little too good to be true  though sympathetic and lovely to look at  of course . her difficult pregnancy and relationships with the other girls of the ward form the heart of the movie  and the outcome   not an entirely happy one   feels right . aline macmahon   one of the cinema  s few perfect actresses   in the apt words of film historian david thomson  exudes warmth and authority as the head nurse  and glenda farrell  as a none  too  willing new mom of twins  gets to croon  frankie and johnny  as a drunken lullaby . frank mchugh figures in another subplot  and he gets to show more range than warners usually permitted him . it  s scaled and paced modestly  and linden  s expectant  dad panic stays with you for days   this sort of part was often played for laughs  but he  s a terrified young kid in trouble  and very persuasive .  ,1

rzone is an awful movie  it is so simple . it seems they tried to make a movie to show the reel life . just like zappa did many years ago . but unfortunately denmark lacks good young actors . leon are by many still the little girl in  krummernes jul   and laura is simply not good enough to play such an important role . several times in the movie she plays with out soul and this is destroying the movie   br    br   even though i consider it a movie you ought to see . i do not agree that the youth are behaving like this  but i think it can show how it can end  if you are letting your child down . also it is important to support danish movies and new companies like  film folket    br    br   all in all i think people should see rzone . not because it is a great film  but because it is a movies which is dealing with important themes . i also think it is important to point out that there are some violent scenes in it  and actually it is in these scenes  laura is acting best .  like the ending where she is holding the gun   ,0
i have nothing against religious movies . religious people need something to watch on a saturday night  i guess . but what really ticks me off is when the write  up on the dvd box does not indicate this fact to the potential viewer . passing off religious propaganda as entertainment is not cool  bro .  br    br   and even if i was a religious person  i would have to agree with most of the other posters here  this movie was a mess . poorly directed  poorly acted  poorly edited  and the attempt at a soundtrack was hilarious . the fake accents were terrible  the characters were mainly stereotypes  and continuity was out the window . the only reason we sat through this lame waste of time was that it was too late to watch another movie instead . should have just gone to bed .  br    br   absolutely no redeeming qualities to this movie  unless you are the religious type who will immediately endorse anything that will preach your beliefs to the unbelievers  even if it  s a pile of garbage . if you aren  t  avoid this at all costs . do not be deceived by the box write  up .  ,0
this might be the worst film ever made  and is possibly worth seeing for that reason alone . streisand is laughably unbelievable as a young woman posing as a man in order to study judaism . the soundtrack is torturous  featuring barbara belting out some of the weakest blather ever put to film . and don  t even get me started on the plot . you will actually get more chuckles out of this film than many comedies because it is soooooooo terrible . the rampant ego of streisand  thinking she could somehow raise this stinker to oscar heights  led to this disaster . i  m pretty sure the novelist  isaac bashevis singer  hated this film and never forgave streisand . i can  t blame him . this movie is like watching a car wreck in slow motion for two hours with the soundtrack of  the sound of music  being played backwards on an old turntable . it  s truly that bad . i  m amazed that anyone from streisand enjoyed this movie on the level that it was intended .  ,0
warning . there might be spoilers ahead  if you care .   br    br   okay  the basic premise of this homegrown texas film is college kids  spookhouse  evil magic book  scary stuff . in practice  it equals a lot of time looking at the time to see how much longer this movie is going to drag on . a bunch of frat boys  along with assorted girlfriends  volunteers  is setting up a charity haunted house . the project is being presided over by a thoroughly repellent character  whose main purpose seems to be verbally  physically assaulting as many cast members as possible . i had a hard time believing that anyone would even attempt to work with this person in any capacity he  s nothing but rude and abusive to everyone  including his girlfriend and his buddy . regardless  the kids are visited by local character  annual pumpkin  carving champion  pumpkin jack   an elderly coot who is described as the  santa claus of halloween   and who drops off a load of props for the house  including an ominous book that figured prominently in the irritatingly strobe  flashed prologue  where a gaggle of robed cultists get turned into stir  fry  . needless to say  some damn fool starts messing with the book  and eventually most of the costumed monsters turn into real ones  and the remaining few normal folk have to try and survive . there  s some good stuff in this film  but not much everything is shot well  and the makeup effects are decent . on the other hand  the performers either underact  or overact drastically much of the plot makes little sense outside of a  this happens so that can happen  series there is hardly any musical score to speak of  just snatches of songs throughout the film and the movie takes an hour to actually get anywhere . that last problem is the most telling two  thirds of the   minute running time is used to repeatedly set up the characters . tom is a nice guy dating heidi the control freak  but he used to date jill  who is now dating dan the jerk  but she  s started a relationship kira the girl who wears too many shawls  capes . dan is a really big jerk  gary likes to play jokes  and steve  lily like to have a lot of sex . stuff that could have easily been dealt with in   minutes or so drags on and on  to the point where the lesbian  sex  scene  calm down  it  s pretty tame  left me looking for the fast forward button . that leaves us with half an hour of lo  calorie scares  a klunky ending and a deep  seated dislike of ol  pumpkin jack  who i blame for the whole mess . unless you can get this on some sort of deep  discount rental  and really have seen everything else in the store   put it back on the shelf and keep looking .  ,0
story of a good  for  nothing poet and a sidekick singer who puts his words to music . director danny boyle has lost none of his predilection for raking in the gutter of humanity for characters but he has lost  in this film  the edge for creating inspiring and funny films . strumpet is painful to watch and barely justified by the fact that it was made for tv .  ,0
a nice shirely temple short . child actors screaming their lines seemed to be the norm for that day and time . perhaps being  seen and not heard  needed to be made up for . aside from that this is fun . given the films era there are certain aspects of the thing  from a social viewpoint  that strike me as both very progressive and liberal . i won  t go into those here  i  d rather not spoil it for you but let you watch it for yourself and see if you spot those elements . as early on as it was its easy to see from this short the fascination that was already developing for temple . that makes it worth watching if you  re a temple fan . for others its a cool way to kill ten minutes while you  re waiting for your good night glass of milk to warm up on the stove .  ,1
i first learned of the wendigo many years ago in one of alvin schwartz  s  scary stories  books according to that story  the wendigo  after calling your name in the wind  drags you along  and then pulls you up into the sky and pulverizes you . while it sounds like a pretty bizarre notion  schwartz  s story turned it into a fairly coherent idea .  br    br   the movie  wendigo  doesn  t . it basically consists of every horror flick clich family moves to new house and strange things start happening  anyone who harms them is asking for it  and everyone had better listen to the old indian guy . i  ve seen this stuff so many times that i no longer bother to count .  br    br   anyway  avoid it . patricia clarkson and erik per sullivan  dewey on  malcolm in the middle   have done far better than this .  ,0

who likes awful  comedy  shows like little mosque on the prairie  the only two kinds of people i can think of who watch this are one  muslims and self  proclaimed liberal defenders of every ethnic group who are so thrilled there is a show about muslims that it doesn  t even matter if the show is good or funny at all  which it is not  . two  old people and people whose idea of comedy is incredibly predictable  badly written  stale jokes .  br    br   cbc needs to really take a look at what they are doing and who their audience is . if they keep only writing comedy for really old people then guess what will happen  their audience will die off soon and they will have no audience left . i  d be curious who even writes for this show  do you think it  s actually muslims  or hip  funny young people  no  i bet it is old white guys who have been writing the same jokes for the same kind of bad cbc shows since the      s .  br    br   when you look at the cbc comedy shows there are  air farce was only finally just taken off the air  thank goodness   but we still have lame ducks like this hour has   minutes and rick mercer that we are paying for  not to mention this poor excuse for  comedy  little mosque on the prairie . it is supposed to be offencive and funny  only the cbc would think this lame show is at all offencive or funny . shame on the cbc for squandering our tax dollars on shows only a few people would bother watching .  ,0
indian summer is a warm  multi  character film  that would make a fine afternoon film  with a bit of editing  .  br    br   the film begins in the past with a group of children being shown a moose  which sets the tone perfectly before cutting into the present  when a group of adults from the  golden age  of the camp are invited back again to spend a few weeks holiday by the head of the camp  uncle lou . the film then allows the viewer to spend time with these characters as they remember their times at the camp  and form new memories in their latest stay .  br    br   the film succeeds in the great way it brings across its characters in this gorgeous setting  and allows them room to develop without having to worry about plot developments . watching these people reminisce  and their relationships with each other is what the film is all about and why it works so well . it never goes to over the top and melodramatic  always keeping its warmth  charm and realism . i  ve never seen a film where nostalgia is captured so well  and found myself getting drawn in despite never having been to one of these camps as a child myself .  br    br   for a warm  nostalgic character movie  i sincerely recommend .  ,1
someone had a great idea let  s have misty mundae do her own  r  rated version of lara croft  firing two guns not only in skimpy outfits  but topless as well . it was indeed a great idea . the problem is that the people who had it couldn  t come up with any sort of script or budget to support it . therefore  we get a  film  that barely reaches medium length by replaying many of its parts  often in slow  motion   and was apparently shot entirely inside a garage . the appeal of misty mundae is still evident she is unbelievably cute and has a natural girl  next  door beauty . however her two female co  stars here  with whom she shares a lengthy lesbian scene  are nowhere near her league . if  mummy raider  was presented as a youtube video  i  d rate it higher  but as a  film  destined for dvd consumption it cannot get more than    a  out of  .  ,0
this film has been scaring me since the first day i saw it .  br    br   my mum had watched it when it was on the telly back in    . i remember being woken up in the middle of the night by her tearful ramblings as my dad helped her up the stairs .  br    br   she was saying something like  don  t let her get me  or something like that . i asked what had made her so upset and she told me that she  d been watching the woman in black .  br    br   so obviously i had to watch it and even though i was only eleven she let me . it scared the s out of me . i  ve been immune to horror films since watching this   ,1
this is easily the worst ridley scott film . ridley scott is a wonderful director . but this film is a black mark on his career . demi moore and viggo mortensen  both totally miscast in an overaggressive film about a girl going to the army . very stupid . and there is never one scene that is convincing in any way . it is really not difficult to make a film such as this . everything the crew makes could have been an idea of just anybody . the writers didn  t have much inspiration either many foolish dialogs that made no sense at all and some brainless action . i strongly recommend to stay away from this rubbish . i hope that the many talented persons involved in this project realize this type of film does not deserve their attention  and that in the future they will work on more honorable and more intelligent movies than this useless mess .  ,0

i have  words for you . sean bean . he is the only worthwhile presence in this film . but even so  don  t see this movie . even though he is good as the main villain  you don  t want to waste your time .  br    br   i didn  t care about the characters  except the little boy  and in fact  i didn  t really care if the star crossed lovers ended up together or died . the movie did not make me care or believe that these people cared about each other at all . i have read a lot of  classic  novels after seeing the movies and this movie made me not even want to read the book . the story seems so boring . but i may go ahead and read it to try to redeem the story in my head .  br    br   stay away from lorna doone . the actress who played lorna was also in sense and sensibility and she was much better in that . watch sharpe  horatio hornblower  a  e has great movies of novels like pride and prejudice . or miniseries like the forsyte saga . check them out  don  t bother with lorna doone .  ,0

disregard the plot and enjoy fred astaire doing a foggy day and several other dances  one a duo with a hapless joan fontaine . here we see astaire doing what are essentially  stage  dances in a purer form than in his films with ginger rogers  and before he learned how to take full advantage of the potential of film . best of all the fact that we see burns and allen before their radio  tv husband  wife comedy career  doing the kind of dancing they must have done in vaudeville and did not have a chance to do in their paramount college films from the   s .  george was once a tap dance instructor  . their two numbers with fred are high points of the film  and worth waiting for . the first soft shoe trio is a warm  up for the  chin up  exhilarating carnival number  in which the three of them sing and dance through the rides and other attractions . it almost seems spontaneous . fan of fred astaire and burns  allen will find it worth bearing up under the  plot  . i  ve seen this one  or  times  and find the fast forward button helpful .  ,1
prior to this film  i had only seen two films by director andrea bianchi the trashy zombie flick le notti del terrore        famous amongst horror fans for its unforgettable performance from man  child peter bark  and the enjoyably sleazy giallo strip nude for your killer . neither film was a particularly spectacular piece of cinema  but both were entertaining in their own special way  and the fact that they featured plenty of gore and nudity didn  t hurt  . massacre  however  is dull  dull  dull  despite quite a bit of splatter and the odd spot of gratuitous bare flesh .  br    br   the story  about a series of murders in a hotel where the cast and crew of a horror film are residing during their shoot  is confusing and oh  so boring when the blood isn  t flowing and the skin isn  t on show  the film is a real struggle to sit through  it took me four attempts to finish   with endless scenes of unlikeable characters bickering among themselves and doing very little of note .  br    br   the only point of interest about the film is that its producer  lucio fulci  used several of its death scenes to pad out his mega  gory movie cat in the brain  aka nightmare concert  . and if you  ve already seen that film  then there is very little reason to bother with massacre .  ,0
there were a lot of truly great horror movies produced in the seventies  but this film certainly isn  t one of them  it  s a shame the child isn  t better as it works from a decent idea that takes in a couple of sometimes successful horror themes . we have the idea of a vengeful child  which worked so well in classic films such as the bad seed and then we have the central zombie theme  which of course has been the backbone of many a successful horror movie . the plot is basically this young girl blames a load of people for the death of her mother  so she goes to the graveyard and raises the dead to get revenge  as you do  . this is all well and good  except for the fact that it  s boring  nothing happens for most of the film  and although it does pick up at the end with some nice gore it  s not enough of a finale to justify sitting through the rest of it . the film was obviously shot on a budget as the locations look cheap and all the actors are rubbish . there  s really not much i can say about the film overall as there isn  t much to it . the child is a dismal seventies horror flick and i certainly don  t recommend it .  ,0
spoiler warning  br    br   first of all i rated this movie  out of   .  br    br   the idea is good  but there are too many stupid errors in the movie  failing to make it the psyching drama that it might have been . first of all she never fights alone . after an initial very strange doubt from her mother  which is not believable when the mother proves to be so supportive and loving later in the movie  the rape victim is not alone .  br    br   she is also unbelievably naive always falling into the crew  s strange traps .  br    br   her friends are unbelievably nasty .  br    br   the thing that i find most unbelievably is that ethan fails to control the crew when he changes his opinon . ethan is very much the leader of the crew  hey  they even say so  and people seem to think the other guy is a jerk  but when ethan changes his opinion he just doesn  t manage to convince even one single person in the crew that he is right and that his former friend is wrong . everyone just simply hates him . . . why   the movie provides no explanation . how did he ever become the leader   br    br   a funny note is that my girlfriend thought i was watching beverly hills when she came in . two actors from the same successful tv  series . . . . a cheap way to get viewers   ,0

lots of reviews on this page mention that this movie is a little dark for kids . that depends on the kid . this isn  t a movie for a    year old it  s more geared toward the  years and older crowd . i saw this movie when i was    i absolutely loved it . at the time most animated movies were a little too childish for my tastes . this movie deals with more serious issues  and therefore has a little more emotional impact . in this movie characters can die  and be sent to hell  this gives a little more emotional weight to the scenes where characters are risking their lives . the good guys aren  t always perfectly sweet and nice  like other cartoons  . they have  real  motivations  like revenge  and greed  but also compassion and friendship shows that things aren  t always black and white .  br    br   excellent movie  ,1
ridiculous  looking little boogers that spawn foam and reproduce themselves . so far for the horror  elements this movie has . all the rest of munchies plays out like a really retarded comedy that  s so stupid you won  t find it funny anymore after about   minutes . i can imagine little kids cheering for these little boogers  but adults will be left with only those supposedly  smart  references translating to on  screen stuff like capt . kirk  s log entries from star trek  the most well  known scene from e . t .  a blatant statement from the filmmakers going  look  we  re cashing in on gremlins  success here   and a cardboard cut  out of clint eastwood telling us . . . what about his western movies exactly  that last one was totally lost on me . . . oh yes  and chemical waste disposal in caves seems to be a bad thing . don  t know where they got that idea from .  br    br   not to say that munchies is the most insufferable film to sit through  for that matter . it  s just really  really dumb . and if you manage to crack a smile while watching it  you  ll probably feel as dumb yourself for having done that after the film  s finished .  br    br   good badness  yes  but only if  dumb    retarded    ridiculous  are criteria you  re looking for .     and  well  uhm      .  ,0
  party girl  capitalizes on the tremendous charm of parker posey . in fact  at times  the movie seems to be a vehicle in which ms . posey is allow to play herself  as she normally is in real life .  br    br   the film  directed by daisy von scherler mayer  is a treat for ms . posey  s fans . ms . von scherler mayer takes us on a wild trip into lower manhattan to show us this aimless soul whose life is dedicated to have fun in the different clubs she constantly frequents . this is an era that still was more naive than what that area and the adjacent meat market districts became . at least  there are no pretensions in the films and we see down to earth people going about their lives in a normal way  if we can call it that way .  br    br   parker posey makes an amazing mary . it  s because of parker posey we enjoy the movie more than if another actress would have played mary . she is the whole picture . the rest of the cast is good .  ,1
i enjoyed watching this well acted movie very much  it was well acted  particularly by actress helen hunt and actors steven weber and jeff fahey . it was a very interesting movie  filled with drama and suspense  from the beginning to the very end . i reccomend that everyone take the time to watch this made for television movie  it is excellent and has great acting    ,1
pushing daisies is just a lovely fairy tale  with shades of  amelie   s aesthetic and romance . it  s got a beautiful palette  its shots well thought out and detailed  its names and dialogue whimsical and too cutesy to be real  its imagination great  and its romance deep .  br    br   watch the blue in the sky pop out at you  as blue can  t be found in the rest of the sets or shots  with few exceptions  .  br    br   watch a weirdly natural and totally satisfying song break out of a scene .  br    br   its score is gorgeous  its cast is supremely likable  there  s great music  and the two leading romantic stars can  t touch each other or she  ll die . how much more sexual tension do you need   actually  i had wished they found a way around this one  but c  est la vie  .  br    br   it is simply a show that it is a pleasure to spend an hour with  and i recommend it highly . there hasn  t been other television quite like it  and i would like to see more . it got me through a flu one crappy week  as it makes for good company .  br    br   bring it back   ,1
the same night that i watched this i also watched  scary movie    making for one messed up double feature . unfortunately for these killer tomatoes they could not stand up to the laugh riot that is the scary movie franchise . while i fought boredom here watching jokes that were silly and stupid  brutally dated and brutally bad  the more recent parody had me laughing out loud . how could i desire any more than that . director john de bello uses the basic premise that some sort of growth hormone has gone terribly wrong and turned the tomatoes into killers . but his main objective here is to slap around the disaster movie genre that was so big back in the day . the script reeks of stoner humor  and perhaps if you take illegal substances with your movie nights this could be your cup of tea . i  sober  was stuck watching a grown man go under cover as a tomato . and that one joke  that is never funny  where the discrepancy between the japanese speaking actor and the voice over is also here . some may giggle  i did not . they even had a hitler joke that wasn  t funny  and i thought all hitler jokes were funny .  br    br   the narrative of this film is so splintered  for no good reason  that it is nearly impossible to explain . tomatoes kill people  the government tries to stop it  bad jokes are told . their aim may have been correct as their targets include the media  consumerism  and paranoia  three things that still control our lives today  . oddly enough the main selling point of this film  those gosh darn tomatoes  really don  t make much of an appearance . and when they do  get this  they  re played by real tomatoes . that washed up gimmick did nothing for me as i get very little out of watching a pack of tomatoes devour a body thanks to the magic of stop action camera tricks . there is also a fear of going for broke at work here that prevents this film from being truly funny . the gag of having somebody fall asleep in nearly every scene may please some audience members  but more than likely it will be seen as an invitation to join in the fun .  br    br   i might also add that there does seem to be some old fashioned human egotism at work here . man eats tomato and that  s dinner  tomato eats man and that is a worldwide catastrophe . but that is just the way the world works . in the film the produce becomes evil because of genetic modification  but in the real world our produce  see taco bell  becomes evil thanks to neglect . and like those evil doin  green onions this film  s shelf life expired a long time ago . there are a few good chuckles to be had . the last shot was really quite splendid  but it was nowhere near enough to save this moderate stink bomb . i  m pretty sure there is a good movie buried deep within this concept  but the script needed to be filtered through about a dozen rewrites to get there . and by  there  i mean to the level of  scary movie  .       ,0
when i saw that mary louise parker was associated with this epic novel turned film  i was intrigued . being a fan of the book  i assumed she  d be playing tony  roz  or charis  but more so  i was intrigued to see how they would turn this very head  y  almost psychological  but not psychological thriller  novel in to a movie that would be accessible to those who hadn  t read the novel  and that would be at least mildly satisfying for those who had . the book is a complex reflection of society  women  and modern life  and i was interested to see how they used the  different narratives that lead to the unfolding of the story in a film . what they actually did was a crime .  br    br   the biggest error and confusing issue is why would oxygen  a network that advertises as being for women  take an amazing book about how complex  wonderful  and terrible women are and can be  and change the protagonist from  women to some dumb former cop with no real motive to be involved in the story  it seems like whoever adapted it took an easy way out by using this guy to straight up ask roz  tony  and charis about how they knew zenia and in doing that  they rushed through bulk of the book . in doing this though they muddied the story and cut everything that is great about the characters in it  aside from making it so the audience had no one credible to associate with . in the film  these women aren  t people  they are characters .  br    br   in the book zenia does fake her death  but the book mentions it to get this point across  while the film wastes      minutes focusing on this former cop running around and doing nothing of use . they tried to make this complex book an episode of law and order or csi .  br    br   it turns out that mary louise parker played zenia  which was so wrong . zenia is a catherine zeta  jones  angelina jolie  or maybe even a scarlett johnasson type . she is a woman men can  t not adore  and a woman that women are intrigued and threatened by  but in a  keep your enemies closer  kind of way . and once she gets closer  she seems totally genuine and trust worthy  despite your better judgment . she  s the kind of woman who  even when she loses  she wins she  s always still beautiful  still rich  and there are always still people out there who don  t know her game .  br    br   in the film  zenia didn  t take charis  s man  the blonde american draft dodger who was using charis in the first place . . .  but instead took august and tried to become her legal guardian  and apparently came back to be her lesbian lover as a lingering kiss at the coffee shop implies  . and zenia did kill the chickens before leaving with august  but it made no sense since all of the build up to it was removed . it  s was as if whoever wrote the screenplay was grasping at straws to satisfy those of us who read the book  but i think had i not read the book  i would have spent the whole movie confused  if i had bothered to stick with it at all .  br    br   and roz  s husband was dead before zenia came in to the picture  which was weird since zenia took roz  s business and home life in the book  which is why roz hated her so much  and she and zenia had conspired to kill roz  s husband years and years back . and according to the film tony and west had been dating forever . . . even at the party where zenia and west  in the book  had painted the whole place black and they made tony seem like this totally with it  and evil  bitchy  person who was always respected by everyone for her intelligence and popular for it . tony  s character was so wrong in this film . . . she seemed a little psycho and like the mastermind behind whatever conspiring was going down as opposed to the kind of gawky  mildly reclusive teacher that she was in the book . the film basically implied smart women are evil  beautiful women are evil  powerful women are evil  and women who teach yoga are off their rockers .  br    br   they basically tried to make it so zenia wasn  t necessarily as awful as she was in the book  and then  in the end  the three women convince this former cop  who  of course in the process of researching this  meets zenia and has an affair with her that is supposed to end with them moving to barbados or something ridiculous  which of course zenia bails on  to hide zenia  s body  which they found splat at the hotel she was staying at  but the film implies that one of the three women pushed her over the balcony  or they conspired together to do it . . .  and then zenia also managed to take all of roz  s money in the process . by the end of the film i was only half paying attention between commercials b  c it had spiraled so far out in space from what it could and should have been .  br    br   if you aren  t confused by this breakdown of the film  then maybe you would like it  because i have read the book and seen the movie  and from the movie alone i am ridiculously confused . it was terrible . i get that making a film out of that book is quite a task  but if you are going to take on the task  you should start by determining what in the book is unnecessary  instead of creating some useless character to be our alice in wonderland .  br    br   are there really no fluffier books that oxygen could be making at least half decent tv movies of   ,0
this work is a bold look into the mindset of men who find themselves in wheelchairs . this film never tries to tone it down  cotton candy  ize  or soft soap the angst  confusion  and pain of what these guys live with . that is its strength  i think .  br    br   but more so  the performances are fantastic  with well conceived and delivered dialog  which draws you in and makes you feel a part of the experience . the characters never attempt to block out the audience from knowing what  s on their mind  what  s in their hearts .  br    br   i found it plodding  but enjoyable .  br    br   it rates a  .     from . . .  br    br   the fiend  .  ,1
 . . . may seem like an overstatement  but it is not .  br    br   what is so hard to comprehend is  why didn  t they make more musical shorts like this  wasn  t the beauty of it totally apparent to everybody involved  i guess not . so many shorts were made for commercial reasons only  and with some luck there may be some artistic value in there . this is one exception  the only one   where it seems they were the director had a vision and clearly could appreciate the music as art . why didn  t anybody ever think to shoot lester or charlie parker on a live date  crazy  man .  br    br   a pity there were no sequels . if you  ve seen anything of similar quality please share it   ,1
anyone giving this movie a good review obviously must have had something to do with its creation . this movie is a painful suckfest . the acting is stiff  the stock generic soundtrack is laughable  the direction is bland and strangest of all  the teacher really isn  t all that attractive  making the student  s blatant advances all the more awkward  . the creative minds behind this trash should disband and spread out to prevent further displays of such concentrated craptitude . i  m certain that some starving kids in africa could have used the money squandered on this project . hell  the funds would have also seen a more enlightened purpose fueling a crack  addict at least someone would be getting some entertainment out of it . for the sole reason that it didn  t give me a terminal illness  i  ll give this film a two .  ,0
i hired this movie expecting a few laughs  hopefully enough to keep me amused but i was sorely mistaken . this movie showed very minimal moments of humour and the pathetic jokes had me cringing with shame for ever hiring it . . . aimed at an age group of       this movie will certainly leave viewers outside of these boundaries feeling very unsatisfied . worth no more than  votes highly unrecommended for anyone not wanting to waste  hours of their lives .  ,0
in iran women are prohibited from attending live sporting events because of the fear that they will be  corrupted  by bad language  close proximity to thousands of men  and the fact that there are no toilet facilities for women in the antiquated stadiums . based on an actual incident involving the daughter of the director  jafar panahi  s offside follows six girls  disguised as men  who are refused entry into the soccer match in     between iran and bahrain  a match that will decide whether or not iran goes to the world cup . in a departure from the bleak  minimalist films we have been accustomed to from iran over the last ten years  offside is an exuberant comedy that has a patriotic fervor and a universal appeal but contains enough subversive social commentary to warrant its prohibition from screenings in iran .  br    br   shot with a digital camera using non  professional actors who are more than up to the task  the girls try to sneak into azadi stadium in tehran but are arrested and placed in a holding area outside of the stadium . they are guarded by three young army conscripts  safdar samandar  mohammed kheir  abadi  and masoud kheymeh  kaboud  who express ambivalence about their task but are pledged to follow the rules . the women are soccer enthusiasts  not political activists and cheer for iran  s victory but this does not deter the soldiers from detaining them while they wait for the girls to be transported to the vice squad and an uncertain future .  br    br   outspoken rather than acting like victims  they continually question the soldiers about the rationale behind the restrictions  making their absurdity quite obvious . although they can hear the crowd noise  the women cannot see the action but achieve a minor victory when they persuade one of the soldiers to provide a running commentary on the game . one of the funniest sequences takes place when a female  prisoner  is escorted to the men  s room by a soldier . the young recruit then must cope with a near riot when he has to prevent anyone else from using the facilities while the girl is still inside .  br    br   little by little  to paraphrase adlai stevenson  that which unites them turns out to be greater than that which divides them and the unlikely antagonists rally behind their country and root for the victory that will send iran to the world cup . although the point is made early and often and the film sags a bit in the middle  offside makes a telling point about a society where a political elite with a medieval social mentality has to contend with an growing group of educated and politically astute citizens . one can only hope that world pressure and the awakening of its own people will force the ayatollahs to come to terms with the   st century .  ,1
so . . . we get so see added footage of brando . . . interesting but not exactly oscar worthy stuff . susannah york was hardly a slouch . new scene where lois finds out clark is superman is slightly unbelievable in that he doesn  t notice that there are blanks coming out of the gun instead of real bullets . real bullets would have penetrated his clothes and then bounced off him onto the floor but forget that . . . let  s listen to donner make fun of lester  s version that made more logical sense . the president talks of the zod  defacing  the washington monument when it was originally mount rushmore . tweaking that scene made that line quite absurd . superman  s  freedom of the press  line sounded silly compared to  . . care to step outside  which was delivered better and had a fitting connection to clark  s earlier scene in the truck stop . then there is the ending with the  turn back the world to go back in time  effect . it turned back everything in the whole movie and made you wonder where exactly the rocket aimed for hackensack  n . j . ever went since it doesn  t free zod and company any more .  ,0
you  ll probably never see it  but the uncut version is about    better than the one you can buy . put it another way once you  ve seen it in its original form  the current version is only half as good .  br    br   it  s still wildly creative and sick  a total success on so many levels .  br    br    ,1
anyone who has a remote interest in science fiction should start at the basics . everyone says star wars and star trek are the best science fiction films to begin at  which is fine but the truth is the terminator and this movie  soylent green  are far better choices than those series . soylent is probably science fiction  s best kept secret . it remains one of the biggest  yet most forgotten films but the impact of its setting is becoming more a reality with each passing day . charlton heston overdramatizes his role  yet it works . edward g . robinson  in his final role  makes the most out of it in soylent green more than anyone else and his final scenes are touching .  br    br   it is manhattan in      the world is overcrowded and food is an unbelievable fortune  a small jar of strawberry jam costs      . a big executive for the soylent company is murdered and police detective thorn is on the case .  br    br   the secret of soylent green is not a mystery if you do research on the movie . soylent is enjoyable to watch  but the whole screenplay is a joke . it is just as cheap as the entire production . the screenplay and the over dramatics of the actors made the movie  yet were completely hilarious . everyone seems to be a moron and no one knows the rules  specifically cop thorn who likes to just waltz into people  s apartments  peruse around shamelessly and steal anything he wants . the character  s interactions keeps your attention on the movie  but still you realize that soylent green sucks . an enjoyable piece if you have the time  but do not expect anything more .  ,0
i would say for it  s time  this movie was awesome . . . and yes if you have no desire to become a christian  then why bother watching it . i saw this movie after i had already been saved and found it to be very moving . i see now they have taken these movies to another level and have created the left behind series . . . they run a close comparison and definitely are more modern to reach people . i think in order to actually judge this movie  you should see it    there are  or  of them in the series if i am not mistaken . . . don  t use our comments to judge  see the movie for yourself   god will bless you if that is why you are watching them .  ,1
a linear travel within a non  linear structure . it  s a fact that time  in   monkeys  flows in this come  and  go between present  future and past . however  the movie  s linearity can  t be avoided it  s the very work of the projector  the unfolding of the narrative .  br    br   what we can see underlying the temporal theme is a reflection on the inevitability of our actions . the world of this terry gilliam film is a world with little space for free  will .  br    br   right from the beginning we are informed about a schizophrenic  s prophecy  according to which a plague would rule the earth in      forcing the few survivors to live underground  the only place not affected by the virus .  br    br   cole  s  willis  mission is clear return to the mid    s to investigate whatever and whoever is related to the release of the virus . there  s no way to change the past all that can be done is gather information that can help the scientists of the present  that  for us viewers  is the future  find the cure . not to change what happened  the past is inevitable   but make the present better .  br    br   in his  returns  in time  cole gradually comes near a striking dilemma his life in the past is better than his life in the present .  br    br   the latter is dark and dehumanizing  controlled by totalitarian scientists that elect  volunteers   this word is incisively ironic  to embark on the journeys to the past .  br    br   the scientists have not yet reached the highest level of achievements in time travel  and cole ends up on wrong dates  this will  later in the plot  work as a proof of his sanity for the psychiatrist kathryn  stowe  .  br    br   we can see  through the evolution of the story  that linearity and non  linearity interlace in a circular temporality .  br    br   there is more than one moment in which the scene that is the first and ends up being almost the last  and certainly the climactic  appears . it modifies itself  according to the evocation of cole  s memories  that come up in his dreams .  br    br   in an airport  a man is shot dead while running  armed  toward someone else . a blonde woman runs after the murdered one .  br    br   this is the scene that connects the past  in which cole is a kid that visits the airport with his parents   the present  the time of the narrative  and the future  adult cole  throughout the narrative  cole has the feeling of having already lived the reality he is experiencing now . his prophetic dreams are the proof that it is impossible to escape or avoid what happened . the agents that shoot him stop him from killing the mad scientist  doctor peters  morse   that is the responsible for the dissemination of the disease .  br    br   what was can  t be changed . and  in cole  s case  what was is what will be . eternally .  br    br   a film not quite well understood for many . to me  nothing less than a masterpiece .  br    br   other good movies with similar theme the back to the future trilogy  that has another angle regarding the  mad scientist  character  and although it shares the atmosphere of decay  particularly in the second film   it is way more optimistic than gilliam  s work  that is an odd hollywood picture  .  br    br   in another register  there is  wild strawberries   one of bergman  s masterpieces  that involves a striking and enlightening travel to the past through dreams and reminiscences .  br    br   i  ve never watched  la jete   but only because i can  t find it .  ,1
this is a delightful movie that is so over  the  top that my wife  daughter  and i found it irresistible . the plot is just crazy but  rings true  to the world of soap operas in all its outrageous improbabilities and impossibilities .  br    br   i particularly enjoyed kevin kline  s and sally field  s performances . i don  t anyone better than kline at playing thickheaded . field  s character  s truly desperate need for attention and affirmation   and her almost bipolar swings in mood   played nicely against the background of field  s famous  infamous    you like me   oscar exclamation . people who can take themselves with such a large grain of salt are all too rare in this world .  br    br   i think this is the only movie where i didn  t find myself impatient with whoopi goldberg characterization i thought she was  spot on  in every note she struck . robert downey jr .  teri hatcher  cathy moriarty  and elizabeth shue were also first  rate as well . just a great movie if you  re in the mood to go along for the ride and laugh   ,1
return to cabin by the lake does not  in any way  stand up to the original . with only one main character  stanley  returning for the sequal  the film is not even worth the  hours of your time . i am a huge fan of the first film  the story line and acting was really good  but this is one movie that i will never again watch . it is basically equal to what the sequals to urban legends and blair witch were like  but with much worse acting . i  ve personally seen better acting in soap operas  it is so pitiful that you just have to laugh . i  in no way  recommend this movie to anyone  watching it will just detract from the first .  ,0
this movie is a rather odd mix of musical  romance  drama and crime with a sniff of film  noir to it . it  s basically one messy heap of different genres  of which none really works out like it was supposed to .  br    br   this movie is an attempt by mickey rooney to be taken more serious as an actor . he  s a former child  star who always used to star in in happy comical  and musical productions at the start of his career . in this movie he picks a different approach  although the musical aspects are still present in the movie  . but his role is actually quite laughable within the movie . i mean mickey rooney as a tough player  he  s an extremely small boyish looking man . he actually was in his    s already at the time of this movie but he seriously looks more like a   year old . hearing him say babe to women and hearing talking tough to gangsters who are about  times bigger than he is just doesn  t look and feel right . he simply isn  t convincing in his role .  br    br   because the movie mixes so many different genres  the story also really feels as a messy one . somewhere in it there is a crime plot and somewhere in it is a romantic plot  line and one about living your dream but none of it works out really due to the messy approach and handling of it all . it just isn  t an interesting or compelling movie to watch . lszl kardos is also a director who has done only   movies in his lifetime  despite the fact that his career span from     till     . he must have been a struggling director who had a hard time getting work into the industry and instead once in a while was given a lesser script to work with . his movies are all unknown ones and normally also not of too high quality .  br    br   let  s also not forget that this is a     s movie but yet it more feels like a     s one or perhaps even as one from the     s . this is of course mostly due to the fact that this movie got shot in black  white . generally speaking black  white movies from the     s often have a cheap looking feeling over it and this movie forms no exception .  br    br   it  s a rather strange sight seeing mickey rooney and louis armstrong and his band as themselves performing together in a sequence . it wasn  t the only movie armstrong appeared in though and he would often pop up in these type of movies  often simply as himself . i guess jazz lovers can still somewhat enjoy watching this movie due to its music  since there is quite an amount of it present in this movie . the movie actually received an oscar nomination for best original song .  br    br   an awkward little movie and outing from mickey rooney .  br    br        ,0
this series was just like what you would expect from mr . spielberg . it is truly one of those frighting  funny  childish shows that you won  t forget . just like outer limits  another great show  this little series does what not a lot can . it was great  and deserved to run longer . it was a great show  that even kids could watch  though some of the shows were a little scary when they wanted to be  but all of them always had a moral at the end  like the twilight zone  that made you realize what situation you didn  t want to end up in  or ones that you did . i remember watching some of these on sci  fi when i was    and even now  i still enjoy seeing them when i can . truly a fun  imaginative show . i loved it  and still do .  ,1
this movie is just funny . mindless  but funny . to enjoy this movie completely you can  t have a perception of how a film like this goes and just enjoy all the side jokes and puns which are involved with the film . i still find the bit at the start funny when he says  want a beer . . . . . . . . cock  . funny stuff . but what makes the film decent is the fact that it doesn  t try to hard to create a serious spin on the film  too many comedies try to have serious aspects which you just don  t believe . but this is different and just focuses on being funny . i must say though  yasmin bleeth is terrible in the film and adds nothing but the  main guys  coop  remer and squeak are very funny to watch and make the film great to watch  ,1
first off  the movie was not true to facts at all . i just saw the documentary a few days earlier and the movie wasn  t anything like it . first of all nash was a genius at mathematics and this is what the movie should have been about not a story about a man who was cured and who found love at the end and so on . also there are a lot of scenes that were just plain wrong  the scene where he rode around with a bike at the campus happened in his early university years not after it . in my opinion russell crowe didn  t fit to this part at all since he doesn  t look the intelligent  individualist type  therefore he really couldn  t play one . it would have been great if it would have focused more on the mathematics  similar to pi  and not the over  dramatized lovelife . at this level abm was too hollywood  ish and too superficial to be great . personally i think he wasn  t mad nor paranoid and he was onto something since people of that caliber tend to know more than we  lesser mortals  .      ,0

the film is about a young man  michael  who cares for the elderly . one day he decides to kill some of the relatives of his clients . around the same time he decides to model his killing after the zodiac killer of the    s . he gets in touch with the author of a book about the zodiac killer and they form a friendship . michael has a gun  aparently the only gun  as it seems to be in the hands of some of the other actors  only not portrayed as the same gun .  and he goes out a  killin  . original .  br    br   this is a great film if you like b movies . i thought the idea of the movie was good  but the editing and the acting really drowned the plot . i thought the  blood  was just too fake  the lighting was horrible in some places  and the dialog was just too standard . the movie was shot on video  which is okay  but the editing of the film just made for some weird  plan   scenes . not a bad movie for fans of the b  movie genre  but if you want something with a bit more polish  move on to something else .  ,0
while i was the video store i was browsing through the one dollar rentals and came upon this little gem . i don  t know what it was about it but i just had a gut instic about it and wow was i ever right .  br    br   the story centers around two girls who have just survived a school shooting . one of the girls is alicia a teenage reble who is the only witness for the full attack and another is deanna another survivor who survived a bullet to the head by some miracle . thrown together by fate  they slowly begin a painful and beautiful display of healing and moving on .  br    br   i just hate it when amazing movies fall through the cracks . because wow what a performance by busy phillips and erkia christensen not to mention the rest of the cast  my only complaint is that the dvd was sorely lacking in special features . oh and some of the jump cuts in the movie were kind of jarring . but all in all a excellent movie .  ,1
i never was an avid viewer of  crocodile hunter   but did occasionally see an episode  or a bit of an episode  and when the news spread about steve irwin  s death from a stingray attack in      it certainly caught my attention . this movie  with steve and his wife  terri  playing themselves  but in a fictional story  was released in      but i didn  t hear of it until several years later  and even after that  it took me a while to get around to seeing it . well  now i have seen it  and after looking here first  more than once   and seeing its rating  i was not surprised at how unimpressive it turned out to be  though it could have been a bit better . apparently  it  s supposed to be a comedy  so a major problem with it is that it isn  t very funny at all .  br    br   a u . s . satellite beacon falls down from space and lands in australia  where it is swallowed by a crocodile  while steve and terri irwin are on a mission to capture this crocodile from a place where it terrorizes the cattle on a ranch owned by the crazy brozzie drewitt  and are unaware of what  s inside it  two cia agents are sent to australia to retrieve the beacon  the agents are assisted by jo buckley  and the ranch owner and her dogs might make the mission more difficult for them  on steve and terri  s mission  they face other types of dangerous wildlife  not just the crocodile  and since they have no clue that the croc has anything unusual inside it  when steve sees the cia agents after them  he mistakes them for poachers   br    br   not only did i not laugh once while watching this film  the only part that really made me smile was steve irwin using a big snake to scare off one of the cia agents . apart from that  i don  t think i found anything even mildly amusing . it  s also a bit of an incoherent mess  switching back and forth from the australian outback to the cia headquarters  and it seems like clips from  crocodile hunter  and clips from an action thriller  or something like that  put together for some reason . also added to that mix are the ranch scenes  which also seem to be from somewhere else  and as funny as brozzie drewitt  played by magda szubanski  is supposed to be  she  s not . at one point  we see her farting  so we have a fart joke  a major clich in modern comedy  are they so hard to resist   i also found the typical  crocodile hunter  scenes  with steve wrestling crocodiles and holding other dangerous creatures and talking about them to viewers  to be tedious  but i guess the fact that i was never a devout fan of the show didn  t help .  br    br   steve irwin was admired by many as a conservationist  and is sadly missed by them  while there are also those who say he messed with nature and had it coming to him . no matter which side you  re on   the crocodile hunter collision course  is not a well crafted movie . i  m sure it does help if you  re a big steve irwin fan  but even if you are  there  s no guarantee that you would like this movie  as some fans clearly haven  t been impressed . in fact  it seems that some of them have found this movie to be worse than i have  so maybe it won  t help . like i said  there  s no guarantee . i would say whatever you may think of steve irwin and his show  this movie was unnecessary . the attempt to combine what is usually seen in  crocodile hunter  with a fictional story unfortunately failed  and a viewer may find that this film seems longer than ninety minutes   ,0

it is always sad when  fringe  movies such as this are overlooked by the majority of filmgoers .  panic  is a wonderfully compelling and poignant study of a character who feels trapped in the pointlessness of his own life .  br    br   william h . macy  as alex  is as convincing as always . this fine actor seems to have a special talent for pulling at your heartstrings  no matter how flawed his characters may be we may not always condone the lifestyles of the protagonists he plays  but the emotions of fear and confusion that he evokes in us are often all too painfully familiar . the title   panic   initially seems paradoxical  given the lack of overt emotion . at one point alex tells his doctor that he rarely gets angry . yet  as this story unfolds  it becomes increasingly obvious that rage and desperation  not indifference  are the driving forces behind this man  s existence .  br    br   more than once i was reminded of his performance in  fargo   another strongly character  driven movie . in both  fargo  and  panic  we witness a middle aged man who somehow seems to have stepped out of synch with the rest of life . he has lost his way  and the only way back deceptively appears to be though the darkness . he knows he is making bad choices  but desperation overpowers self  control and common sense .  br    br   alex connects with sarah  a   year old woman  mesmorizingly played by neve campbell   whom he meets in a doctor  s office . thematically  this union is less coincidence  more the work of fate . alex finds a certain comfort being with sarah  sensing perhaps that she is a fellow drifter  like him  someone who has lost her way and is floating aimlessly through the rest of her life  waiting powerlessly for its inevitable conclusion .  br    br   opting for movies such as this is a shrewd and convincing way for neve campbell to answer those critics who question her acting abilities . too often it is the characters she has played who are the weakness  offering campbell no depth in which to flex her acting muscles . this performance  however  may be an eye  opener for many .  br    br   in a perfect movie world  not only would there be many more films like  panic   but also they would reach and be appreciated by a much wider audience . if you watch movies for the richness and depth of characterization  rather than merely the latest state  of  the  art special effects  then  for you   panic  is unmissable . a .  ,1
prior to watching  dahmer   i thought no movie could be worse than  freddy got fingered .  i was wrong . to sum  dahmer  up  it  s a story about a gay serial killer which features almost no killing and almost entirely consists of dahmer  s encounters with gay men before they were killed . there is no plot to be found  and it serves no purpose as far as telling us anything about  dahmer .  all you  ll learn about dahmer from watching this movie is that he liked to have sex with men . horrible acting  horrible directing  horrible writing  horrible everything . . . if you have to choose between watching  dahmer  and projectile vomiting for three hours  go with the vomiting . . . . it wll be less painful . . . . .  ,0
this is  in my opinion  much better than either of the       s versions  but is still not all that good . it feels dated  probably because it is  but it does stand up well compared to other bbc      s period pieces such as mansfield park and northanger abbey .  br    br   the length of this adaptation allows for a much better adaptation of the book than either of the     s versions  and st john rivers is at least covered  although not very well . timothy dalton is very good as rochester  but the actress playing jane is much too old . there is definitely scope for a tv adaptation of this length that has more than a tenner spent on it .  ,1
long before  brokeback mountain   about   years before    deathtrap  was the first time i ever saw two men passionately kissing on screen  and frankly  i was shocked . i understood it in terms of the plot  and it didn  t really upset my sensibilities  not much   but it was the first time i ever saw it  at least  in a  mainstream  movie . i thought it was a gutsy move for its time  and took courage for them to try it  especially christopher reeve  in the midst of his time as pg  rated superman . male bisexuality on screen may have hit its stride with  brokeback   but it  s interesting to note this much  earlier incarnation .  ,1
this one will get reviews all over the map because it doesn  t comfortably fit any mold . it  s horror   but not a splatterfest . it  s equal part suspense as well as horror   yet without the usual hollywood screams and jerky camera .  br    br   the feel of the movie is spare and lean with next to no special effects because i think you should listen and watch the faces of the characters .  br    br   forget that brendan is a graduate of the buffy universe . that  s a red herring . he is acting here .  camp  is a misreading of the tone of this story . adrienne barbeau is giving a rock solid performance   so she must believe the script has something to say . we all know the sorry excuses where the actors plainly don  t care anymore and are just waiting for the director to snap  cut  and get their paychecks . this is not the case  here .  br    br   forgive the fact that the bodies begin to fall with almost mondo  funny regularity . i don  t think the intent was humorous   but to keep you off balance .  br    br   think of it less of a horror  movie  and more of a horror  play  on a stage   that decrepit whitewashed house . then you might see it  s really about paranoia  fear  and spiralling madness set in an isolated someplace  usa .  br    br   and it is twisty . time travel  mind control  secret experiments and nazi  s who may not be dead . . . yet .  br    br   i say rent it and give it a try if you  re in the mood for something a little cerebral . this would be a good choice for a saturday midnight sit down .  ,1
  br    br   i really liked this film . one of those rare films that hollywood really does not make anymore . william h macy is just great as the hit man with a soul  and neve campbell is just flat out fantastic as the woman who puts his life on the track of redemption .  br    br   if you have a chance  see this film . it earns it  s praise  ,1

at the beginning i was happy to know about a new superman movie  i though that will be great but it wasn  t .  br    br   is a bad copy of the richard donner work  lex is again a villain that makes no more else  even played by kevin spice .  br    br   the evil plan is the same of the first movie of donner just a lot forced .  br    br   the script is predictable and simple  all stuff luthor finds in a museum or an old lady  .  br    br   the story is the wrong thing  it must be the kevin smith script and may be it could be better .  br    br   i just hope a sequel without brian singer and with a new talent director to do something new and not a copy .  br    br   all read you later  ,0
i remembered this as being one of my favorite books as a child and had been wanting to read it to my  year old daughter for a while now . i knew the movie was coming out soon so we went to the library to get the book and they gave us preview passes for the next day  we rushed home and spent the afternoon reading the book so we could compare . wasn  t necessary . the only thing in common between the book and the movie is the main characters  first name  the fact that there is a bet  and a whole lot of worm eating . oh yeah  i almost forgot  the kid who cooks most of the worms likes to present his masterpieces with a french accent . how the kids know each other  the number of kids involved  how the bet came about  the number of worms that must be eaten  the time frame in which he has to eat the worms  how they are cooked  progression of friendships  climax scenes  etc .  nothing is the same . but somehow  it did not ruin the movie for me . the characters are all enjoyable  and the film did not leave me disappointed . word of caution for parents  there was one moment when you could hear the adults in the room collectively draw their breath and that was when billy  s little brother referred to his penis as a  dilly dick  . the embarrassing part came when my daughter proceeded to ask those sitting around us   does anybody know what a dilly dick is   lol . that and an occasional  shut up  is as foul mouthed as this film gets . my daughter thought she might get sick around worm  and   and was holding the empty nacho container just in case  but was fine by worm  . she and i both really enjoyed the film and had a wonderful time sharing the experience .  ,1
there are few uplifting things to say about this  but i can mention matt dillon doing his best to make something out of nothing and the many split screens and graphics that are worthwhile . as most race movies suffer from the premise that car lovers are not that intelligent  we end up with movies like this .  br    br   lindsay lohan who surprised so much in mean girls has to make better decisions which roles to take . here she can only fail .  br    br   children will only be mildly entertained because it tries to appeal more to adults than children  although still pretty dumb  . the ones in the theater i saw it with showed no real interest after a couple of minutes . and as a family sports movie this is horrible . the better moments are in the beginning at the scrapyard creating some sentiment and later in the car  bash fest creating some tension . if you develop a car as a central character you have to develop it better than here . after a few obligatory race scenes you are in for the best part being able to leave the multiplex in your own car .  ,0
although this was obviously a low  budget production  the performances and the songs in this movie are worth seeing . one of walken  s few musical roles to date .  he is a marvelous dancer and singer and he demonstrates his acrobatic skills as well  watch for the cartwheel   also starring jason connery . a great children  s story and very likable characters .  ,1
this is one of those movies that  s difficult to review without giving away the plot . suffice to say there are weird things and unexpected twists going on  beyond the initial superficial  tom cruise screws around with multiple women  plot .  br    br   the quality cast elevate this movie above the norm  and all the cast are well suited to their parts cruise as the irritatingly smug playboy who has it all  and then loses it all  diaz as the attractive but slightly deranged jilted lover  cruz as the exotic new girl on the scene and russell as the fatherly psychologist . the story involves elements of romance  morality  murder  mystery  suspense and sci  fi and is generally an entertaining trip .  br    br   i should add that the photography is also uniformly excellent and the insertion of various visual metaphors is beautiful once you realize what  s going on .  br    br   if you enjoy well  acted movies with twists and suspense  and are prepared to accept a slightly fantastic philip k dick style resolution  then this is a must  see .  br    br        ,1
ok  i would not normally watch a farrelly brothers movie . i can  t recall ever watching one . i also don  t recall watching a jimmy fallon movie . alright  i did watch taxi  but i said penance and was forgiven for that mistake . but  this movie had drew barrymore and i just think she is the cutest thing . i don  t know what it is about her  but i just smile the whole time i am watch her . she just captivates me that way . i mean i even watched adam sandler just to see her in   first dates . how sad is that  this wasn  t the greatest baseball movie  it wasn  t supposed to be . it was a love story about a sad puppy that hung on to the only thing that never let him down until he found something worth giving that up for . it had a predictable ending  but there was so much on the way there that made it worthwhile .  ,1
the second half of steven soderbergh  s revolutionary bio on che guevara deals with his last campaign to export revolution to bolivia . in order to maintain his saintly visage of che soderbergh conveniently leap frogs the mass executions he presided over after the revolution in cuba and the folly of his congo adventure   this is the history of a failure  he writes in the preface of his congo journal  to concentrate fully on che  s attempt to rally support to rise up against the government in bolivia . it would turn out to be a disaster and guevara  s final act .  br    br   what plagued the first chapter follows suit here as soderbergh slows his film to a crawl to study the beatific countenance of the contemplative guevara once again being played like james dean in east of eden by bernicio del toro . the problem is guevara has little success in gaining converts and he soon finds himself and his starving comrades being swallowed up in the heart of darkness bolivian jungle . unlike werner herzog in the magnificent  aguirre  the wrath of god soderbergh fails to utilize the jungle  s metaphorical possibilities to heighten the desperation of the guerrillas . he seems more concerned with keeping che  s nimbus above his head than exploring the panic setting in on the dead enders . there is one herzogian moment where che sits astride an obstinate horse kicking and screaming to get it moving but overall soderbergh  s mise en scene remains flat  sloppy and uninteresting .  br    br   in both of his films soderbergh shows he is clearly a che groupie and because of it his focus remains myopic and narrow . he spends too much time building his monument to che and too little in developing his relationships with key players in his saga  especially fidel castro . making matters worse he does it with a slow and dispassionate approach that never catches fire . one would think he was steeped in enough eisenstein and vertov to realize that sweeping change is showcased a lot better with sweeping style .  ,0
gunga din       is based on rudyard kipling  s poem . the movie is directed by george stevens . it  s set in india during the   th century where three british soldiers have to stop an evil guru and his murderous cult . gunga din is a marvelous adventure war comedy with plenty of thrilling moments . the three leading men are brilliant . cary grant is sgt . archibald cutter  victor mclaglen is sgt .  mac  macchesney and douglas fairbanks jr .  the son of the legendary you know who  is sgt . thomas ballantine . let  s not forget the other fine players who include sam jaffe playing gunga din himself in a brilliant way . the beautiful and gifted joan fontaine is emaline stebbins . it  s awfully fun to watch the difficulties of tommy  s and emmy  s wedding plans . gunga din is awfully lot of fun . it can be funny  it can be thrilling . it can be everything a good movie requires .  ,1
the minute i started watching this i realised that i was watching a quality production so i was not surprised to find that the screenplay was written by andrew davis and was produced by sue birtwhistle both of these brought us the excellent     production of pride and prejudice  so my only gripe here is that emma did not run to  or  or maybe even six episodes like pride and prejudice . the acting was superb with i think prunella scales excellent as miss bates but i loved kate beckinsale and mark strong just as much . the language is a delight to listen to  can you imagine in this day and age having a right go at someone without actually uttering a swear word  samantha morton was excellent as miss smith in fact the casting was spot on much as it was with pride and prejudice . i liked it so much that i watched it twice in two days   so once again thank you bbc for another quality piece of television . i have seen the paltrow version and it is okay but i do think the bbc version is far superior . an excellent production that i am very happy to own on dvd     ,1
this film is being described as a comedy  but it wasn  t a comedy at all . like any panahi film  it was a very realistic drama depicting the common thread of social inequity and hypocrisy . but it was very funny much lighter than the director  s dark and serious the circle  my favourite iranian film  . the resourcefulness of the girls and the banter between them and the soldiers was both completely believable  as if it were a documentary  and completely hilarious .  br    br   the filming the actual match and aftermath was astonishing . it added a realism much like australia  s kenny  of course a very different film .  br    br   the performances from all the non  professional actors  soldiers and girls  were very credible . it was very moving to see the passion  disappointment and excitement of these girls . anyone in this country who thinks muslim girls wearing a chador are any different to their own daughters should go see this film  it will be a real eye  opener .  br    br   to me  the soldiers represented the current paradigm . they started out with stock  standard official policy responses to all the pleas of the girls . as the film progressed  they found it more and more difficult to maintain this stance . when what seems like all of teheran breaks out into wild celebration  everyone is caught up in it  and the ridiculousness of the current policies is obvious to one and all .  br    br   it was a very moving and unexpected ending  and gave the film a really nice blend of emotions  frivolity  drama and social commentary . though it  s adult cinema  i think mature  minded children from about seven onwards would really appreciate this film  as long as they can read subtitles  .  br    br   it is remarkable that a repressive country like iran is able to produce films of such quality by the likes of panahi and kiarostami . perhaps the constraints there force directors to be extremely resourceful . australian  and other  film makers could take a leaf out of their book .  ,1
this is a must see for anybody who loves thriller  s specially political thriller . one scene that stands out is milgram experiment it is shot to perfection very rarely do we get to see a movie shot and scripted the way this movie is presented .  br    br   the movie starts with a kennedy like assassination and a three member team is constituted to investigate the assassination . however one of the member does not agree with the final findings of the committee . as per the terms set that member would initiate a one man investigation into the assassination . this investigation gets him involved in into to deep and dark secrets of high office politics and the way they are controlled .  ,1
i first saw this movie back in the early     s when it was first released . room with a view was also newly out . enchanted april had so much more to offer  i found it much more real and earthy  the characters more believable for being  normal  . by the end of the film i felt the same as i did when i first saw the bbc production of pride and prejudice  i was yearning for the characters to find what they were looking for whether it was isolation  peace  liberty or love . you get a sense throughout that italy is so far removed from everything they have ever known  that they are so decadent for taking a risk and leaving behind all that is humdrum and constricting . but in the heat of the spring in april  everyone  s lives loosen and unravel  in line with the victorian corsets  and are slowly rebuilt to everyone  s satisfaction . what a little gem of a film  how come it isn  t more well known   ,1
this is certainly one of the most bizarre films ever made  even for fellini . about the only one more bizarre is his satyricon . this is a two and a half hour romp through a strange nightmarish world of decadence  opulence and sexual challenge . sutherland makes a curiously unappealing casanova and the odd goings on in a series of unrelated vignettes taken from the great lover  s autobiography fail to engage the viewer . the art direction and costume design are however outstanding . the academy missed on not even nominating the former but did itself justice by rewarding an oscar for the latter . also nominated  oddly  was the disjointed  pointless and almost inacessible screenplay . go figure   the film on video is only    minutes    minutes short of the original running time . this viewer was grateful .  ,0
the film is bad . there is no other way to say it . the story is weak and outdated  especially for this country . i don  t think most people know what a  walker  is or will really care . i felt as if i was watching a movie from the    s . the subject was just not believable for the year      even being set in dc . i think this rang true for everyone else who watched it too as the applause were low and quick at the end . most didn  t stay for the qa either .  br    br   i don  t think schrader really thought the film out ahead of time . many of the scenes seemed to be cut short as if they were never finished or he just didn  t know how to finish them . he jumped from one scene to the next and you had to try and figure out or guess what was going on . i really didn  t get woody  s  carter  private life or boyfriend either . what were all the  artistic  male bondage and torture pictures  from iraq prisons  about  what was he thinking  i think it was his very poor attempt at trying to create this dark private subculture life for woody  s character  car  . it didn  t work . it didn  t even seem to make sense really .  br    br   the only good thing about this film was woody harrelson . he played his character  car  flawlessly . you really did get a great sense of what a  walker  may have been like  say twenty years ago  . he was great and most likely will never get recognized for it .  br    br   as for lauren  lily and kristin . . . boring .  br    br   don  t see it  it is painful  unless you are a true harrelson fan .  ,0
this movie was absolutely ghastly  i cannot fathom how this movie made it to production . nothing against the cast of the movie  of course  this is all the fault of the writing team . you take the old average plot  let  s dance our way out of being poor and destitute  or step in this case . but this one lacks any semblance of a true plot  or at least one that anyone would care about . with canadian speaking actors in what is supposed to be an american setting  this film falls very flat . on a positive note  the directing was pretty good and cinematography was pretty decent as well . looks like the production budget was very generous as well . my only request is that this team leave the writing alone and go find actual screenwriters to help them bring words alive on film . net result  how she move is how she sucks .  ,0
an intriguingly bold film weaves the seemingly effortless camerawork with some superb casting and an explosive soundtrack to plot the damaging effects of the crime and corruption of the santiago underworld on  naive young brothers from the southern city of temuco .  br    br   film debutant daniella rios is the seductive erotic dancer gracia  working in the nightclub owned by the face of the new mini  wave in chilean film production  alejandro trejo . the elder brother  played maturely by nestor cantillana  is easily convinced to become trejo  s lead henchman  after a night at the stripclub to celebrate younger brother victor  s  juan pablo miranda  seventeenth birthday . from the establishing shot of this opening scene  the film explodes into neo  noir exploration of everything the outside world doesn  t usually expect to see in this country so stereotypically conservative and catholic .  br    br   gracia  s charms of seduction attract the three men like bees to honey  although the circular narrative of the three  way fantasy romance revolves around the linear portrayal of major international drug deals between trejo  s men and the  gringo   eduardo barril . power relations become a vital theme  as society  s outsiders merge in a mini  family . the prostitute holds an exotic spell over all the chilean men in the film  emerging from her ambiguous position in the periphery of society  and is seen as holding the key to all three men  s futures . the relationships between trejo and cantillana become important  as the boys  parents are conspicious by their absence  one assumes they still live in temuco  . therefore it is trejo  el padrino  who  adopts  cantillana  and effectively  makes him  as a man in the city . miranda rapidly becomes the desperate outsider  as his dependency on his  father figure   cantillana  becomes increasingly strained by jealousy over the beautiful gracia . however  miranda remains trapped by the constraint of still being in school  he is dependent on cantillana  who is dependent on trejo  for the money to survive . trejo  in turn  is under the thumb of the  gringo   and his wealth has been accumulated through drug deals and well as his strip clubs . the figure of gracia acts as a time bomb viewed as a beautiful firework  she wraps a web of beauty inside the patriarchy but the strain can only lead to one climax .  br    br   as the tensions of these power relations come to head  gracia remains ambiguously elusive . the viewer is never sure which male figure she will commit to . the film concludes tragically and explosively in a shoot out which realigns power relations and erases half the major male protanganists . the final shot of miranda  s beaten face speeding down the panamericano highway is despairingly powerful . the boy has been sucked in by the lure of the city  s underworld  yet has lost his only visible family  and his woman  who is his only friend in the film . he has nothing . the overriding metaphors are bold and brave . this is a gangster film in chile . the notions of family  no sex before marriage etc  are abolished  and instead the harsh realities of the other side of santiago  s coin are displayed in all their savage glory . trejo beats rios brutally  rios and miranda make love in a cinema reel room  a whore having sex with a minor she barely knows . the  gringos  are seen to have a financial hold over this small latin american nation  but not through the copper mines  through the illegal path of drugs .  br    br   waissbluth  s triumph is in his presentation of this dark underworld  which raises so many social questions  more perhaps than the record  breakingly successful sexo con amor  within a slick  smooth firecracker of a film  which place this film firmly alongside sexo con amor  taxi para tres  and el chacotero sentimental  as cinematic evidence that chile is well and truly artistically alive and kicking in the post  transition period   years after the censorship of the military regime .  ,1
for most younger viewers out there  they probably have no idea who buster keaton was . so  because of this  they probably won  t feel nearly as sad when watching this film as i did . i happen to be a silent comedy freak   having see just about every keaton film still in existence . my being a huge fan made this film very painful from start to finish . this is because during his silent days  keaton was a very vibrant and creative comedian . he was amazing in his physicality and his films were almost never dull . however  in a move that movie historians still are baffled by  at the end of the silent era  keaton gave up his independence and became a stock mgm actor . instead of being a great creative force  mgm now saw keaton solely as an actor   and they wrote scripts for him that had no respect for what made him great . at first  these films with mgm were not that bad  such as the cameraman  but with talkies  the studio really blew it   putting him in several films with jimmy durante . durante  s humor was based on his gift for gab and was abrasive . keaton  in contrast  was quiet and based on action . two more unlike and incompatible actors would have been hard to find . as a result of this deadly combination  keaton made some truly dreadful films .  br    br   now this isn  t to say that speak easily is a terrible film . no  instead it  s just more of a time  passer and an amazingly unfunny one at that . in fact  if you go into the movie assuming it  s a comedy  it will probably make the film harder to enjoy . instead  it  s sort of like a drama with a few comedic elements . it is not a film that will produce belly laughs   especially for keaton fans .  br    br   the film begins in an odd setting . keaton is cast as a college professor whose entire life is teaching . he knows nothing of the world and has his nose stuck in his books . in a bizarre move  keaton  s servant tricks him into believing keaton has received         from a dead relative   hoping that this would spur keaton to get out and enjoy life . this is amazingly contrived but somehow it manages to work . not terribly well  but it works .  br    br   keaton immediately leaves school and goes on a journey to new york to have some fun . on the way there  he meets up with an incredibly untalented theater troop . because he knows nothing of the world  he doesn  t seem to realize they stink . and  because he thinks he  s rich  keaton decides to take them all to new york to perform on broadway . however  just before the show opens  his friends find out that keaton is not rich . so  they decide not to tell keaton and try to keep him away from process servers that want to close the show . they assume that if the show is a hit  then they can pay off the debts and everyone will be happy . however  they forget that the show itself stinks . what are they to do  and  will keaton get the nice girl  get roped by a gold digger  thelma todd  or be flat broke and alone  if you care  see the film .  br    br   as for keaton  he has few stunts in the film  though there are some dandy ones near the end . instead  keaton just kind of walks through the part in a very subdued manner . there  s really little to love about this film or hate . it  s just blah . . . . when it should have been a heck of a lot better .  ,0
jet li  is one of the best hand to hand combat fighters in the world . he has been for over   years and he puts others in the genre to shame . while he is big in asia  he is almost unknown here in the us .  br    br   black mask is supposed to be a breakout movie for him  but it fails horribly . first of all  it is dubbed . while it may have camp value  the dubbing isn  t even close and it is flat in tone   it seems inappropriate for the ordinary movie viewer . secondly  the director in this movie  daniel lee  does a horrible job . he cuts scenes so fast  at times  you don  t know what  s going on . other times  the camera shakes and wobbles . fans see jet li  s movies for the fantastic martial arts . however  the director edits the scenes so fast that you don  t even know who  s who half the time  other times  a scene is left hanging  ie li is beginning to cut a hole in the floor of a jeep  while the badguys arm their guns  two seconds later  both li and the love interest are already under the car   other scenes are so improbable  that they cross over the point of being completely ridiculous  killer cd roms  just give him throwing stars      . li  needs a director who is less prone to machine gun cutting and more to creating a cinematic mise  a  scene . the added rap  techno music goes from being okay to intrusive . the plot has possibilities but are all squandered by cartoonish characters that take away from any credibility that this movie strives for . and are we really to believe that the love interest would not recognize simon  because he has a half mask on  wouldn  t the hair  lower jaw  or voice give it away   br    br   if you want to see a jet li movie  try iron monkey or his classic shaolin temple . this disjointed mess is a complete waste of time . . . . .      ,0
i guess i am coming late to the party . i just saw this     version of bye bye birdy on sky tv . i didn  t know it existed and was fully prepared to see the     film version when i turned it on .  br    br   i played albert a long time ago and i am thinking of putting on an amateur production of the show because i remembered it as being so much fun to do . i was not impressed with this newer version . it just wasn  t enough fun . it was not colorful . it lacked the exuberance of youth . the lighting was bad . no one seemed to mention this fact . this is not a moody musical  it is bright and up beat . the lighting decision was a poor creative choice .  br    br   bye bye birdy is a farce  a comedy of errors . i got no sense of that in this version . the lighting was awful and it dulled the overall performances . the dance numbers seemed anemic as well . we do have music videos these day . at least the dance numbers should have measured up to some of the best of those  or how about some of the best of broadway . the choreographer was asleep at the wheel it seemed .  br    br   although all the actors were supremely talented  there were some really bad casting choices . vanessa williams is not latin  and with so many talented latin performers out there  wouldn  t it have been more correct to cast one of them in the role of rosie . vanessa is african american  lovely and talented  but bad casting . jason alexander  s effort was astounding  he always does intelligent work  but he just wasn  t albert . he was miscast and i think that is obvious to most people who see this version .  br    br   the medium of film is not the medium of stage . there needs to be translation from one medium to another . the exuberance and the flash of stage musical must be translated to film . there is no merit being faithful to a stage script when it is being filmed . the spirit  the essence of the production must be brought forth . to me the     film production of bye bye birdy was bright and lively  while the     production was as gloomy as the lighting and as lackluster as the dance numbers . it turned out to be an unfortunate waste of effort by many really talented people .  ,0
having just finished cronicles of the heroic knight mere minutes ago i find myself extremely please but questions still loom over me . while it would appear that the first  episodes or so are actually a retelling of the events of the first record of lodoss war the truth is that they really aren  t . it would appear that the creator of cothk had a different vision as to how the original ended  and that may be the reason that the first  episodes occur  but i do not find that to be the case . cothk does say it starts  years after the war of heros which parn was a part of . i think the director made the first  episodes seem so much like a recap of the original just to give the viewer a small reminder and an introduction to characters and their deeds done because they appear much less after the series kicks into spark  s story . now  once the series does kick into spark  s portion we find ourselves kicked up another   years    years now since the war of heros  . spark and his crew do  in some cases  resemble parn and his crew once the journey kicks into gear  especially the love story that brews between spark and neese . i also thought several times throughout cothk that i threw in the original series and if it wasn  t for spark  s long blue hair i know i would  ve pressed stop more than once to make sure the right disc was in . by no means do i consider these major set backs however  the writers did a fine job in crafting believable characters and a remarkable storyline . the only thing that makes me hurt is that ashram and wagnard return . ummmm . . . how    don  t get me wrong both are great villains even though ashram  s only villainous trait is that he supports the marmo . perhaps i missed something during the coarse of the series that explained that part . as far as sequels go though  i highly recommend cothk . i place both cothk and  even more so  the original record of lodoss war far above the lord of the rings trilogy . both of these are more epic than anything i  ve ever seen or read . i highly recommend this .  ,1
my score for this crap      for the technical only . everything else is very bad .  br    br   another film that makes no sense . clearly it seems that creating a good script for film or television is almost a impossible mission .  br    br   while it  s easy to understand why politicians never say the truth  they are among the biggest liars on the planet  it is difficult to understand how to make films so pathetic .  br    br   we must believe that taking people for morons . perhaps it was reason to believe  since    of the films are crap . because they are stupid and ridiculous and very bad scenarios .  br    br   when you look at the price we give oscars  we understand better why we continue to make films any more ridiculous than others .  br    br   and oddly enough it was always money for such nonsense . but it was not for education and health .  br    br   if you still want to listen to this st  press super fast forward button  at least   x  .  ,0
the secret of kells is one of the most unique  beautiful  and eye  popping animated films i have ever seen . before watching this film  i was convinced that nothing could give up a run for its money and that it was a shoo  in to win in this category  but i found in kells a serious contender .  br    br   the secret of kells tell the story of a young orphan named brendan  who lives with his uncle  the abbot of kell . the abbot is a loving guardian  but perhaps a bit too strict and much more concerned with fortifying the wall around the town from a coming attack by vikings than he is at nurturing the boy  s imagination . when the legendary brother aidan  who looks surprisingly like willie nelson  shows up and takes the boy under his wing  brendan goes on a journey into the woods and meets a lovely forest nymph named aisling who takes a liking to him  and saves his life more than once  . with aisling  s help  he attempts to save the town and help brother aidan complete the mystical book whichlegend has itcan turn dark into light .  br    br   see my full review of the secret of kells at http   theoscarsblog . blogspot . com          movie  review  secret  of  kells . html  ,1
saw this in preview  great movie  wonderful characterizations  witty and intelligent dialog  actors were fantastic  peter falk will be up for an oscar  paul reiser was charming  photography was marvelous reiser was at the theater when we saw the film  and he gave a vivid account about the making of the film  it had been a long dream of his to write a semi  autobiographical account of relationships between sons and fathers  and more specifically between him and his father  this was achieved in a dramatic and entertaining fashion  the supporting cast was well chosen and gave the film a feeling of family  i recommend this film to anyone who is longing to see intelligent drama and wonderful performances  ,1
where the hell are all these uncharted islands where prehistoric monsters lurk  evil doctors perform their experiments  madmen hold the ultimate karate championship  and the uber  rich hunt humans for sport  i had no idea there were still so many uncharted islands out there  but if you take into account the number of movies that utilize one of these mysterious islands as a location  you  d have to assume that there are at least   of these suckers out there . it always winds up feeling so damned convenient and i immediately deduct points from any movie that uses this hackneyed device . hammerhead is the story of a mad scientist who is conducting experiments on one of these uncharted islands  so the movie already had a lot to make up for before it even began .  br    br   the island in this movie used to belong to dr . moreau  but has recently been purchased by the re  animator himself  jeffrey combs . old jeffrey is doing some kind of cutting edge stem cell research  which has led him to start working with sharks while searching for a cure for cancer . if that sounds familiar  that  s because this is roughly the same basic set  up as the smart shark facility in deep blue sea  not to mention a host of other nu image movies . so apparently  jeffrey  s son was dying of cancer which prompted our mad doctor to start experimenting on his progeny . he did some kind of super fancy gene splicing and so forth  turning his son into a shark  man .  br    br   william forsythe leads a crew of unknown actors to the island to look into the doctor  s experiments . if someone would have given him a sailor  s hat  william would have been a dead ringer for the skipper from gilligan  s island . in typical bond villain fashion  the doctor decides that all of these intruders would make nice chum for his son . not chums  like buddies . . . chum  like shark food . so enter shark  boy who starts stalking the skipper and his cohorts all over the island . they  of course  make half  hearted attempts to escape and are thwarted over and over again while being chased by a guy in a rubber shark  man suit .  br    br   the movie didn  t make up any of the points that it lost for taking place on one of those dastardly deserted islands . it  s funny that this movie is called hammerhead  it made me think of an old joke . why do you hit yourself in the head with a hammer  because it feels so good when you stop . that  s pretty much how this movie is . the only reason to watch it is because it feels so good when it  s over .  ,0
the movie and acting are not bad and jay hernandez does a good job playing calito brigante but the movie forgets it  s suppose to be a prequel to a hit movie . the makers of this prequel clearly did not watch the original carlito  s way or at least did not care about continuity . this movie is a prequel which means the original movie has already laid out some history for us and this movie should end where the original begins or at least lead up to it . not one of carlito  s close old friends from the original make an appearance in this movie  they  re not even mentioned . luis guzman  pachanga in the original  is in the movie but he plays a completely different character . the original takes place in     and the prequel takes place in        . considering this movie takes place less than  years earlier  wouldn  t you think one of carlito  s long time friends would make an appearance  in the original  carlito start  s out being released from jail after spending  years in jail . that  s only a few month  s between the end of the prequel and the start of the original  semi spoiler we know from the beginning of the original  carlito has spent  years in prison so when the prequel gives us this hollywood happy ending it  s an insult to the intelligence of fans of the original . what happen to gail  it  s the lack of continuity that made this film go direct to video release .  ,0
  the   year old virgin  exists in a world i don  t understand . a world where an electronics store employee can tell his boss to  f off  and broadcast videos of his naked ass throughout the store and not get reprimanded . a world where it  s really funny to go drunk driving and smash into other peoples  cars . a world where it seems okay for a boss to sexually harass her underlings . a world full of raging and offensive stereotypes of ethnic minorities . and a world without any funny jokes  i am absolutely shocked at the seeming chorus of viewers who liked this movie . i thought every scene was like a bad saturday night live sketch  not very funny to begin with  and stretched out beyond all rational thought . the chest  waxing scene went on forever .  br    br   the characters  aside from carell  were totally one  note . and the romantic elements were completely contrived  particularly the scene where keener finds porn in carell  s apartment . that was just lame .  br    br   and i also found the  aquarius  sequence totally annoying and excessive . i hated hated hated this movie   ,0
wow . who ever said that edward d . wood jr . never influenced anybody  this steaming pile of donkey excrement is a perfect case in point it makes  the violent years  look like  casablanca    santa claus  also makes keith richards  worst flashbacks look like my first nocturnal emission . i  ve had nightmares  you know  waking up and sweating bullets  that will never come close to the visceral terror that santa claus unearthed from the seemingly pure soil of my very being . however  i can think of some parties where this film might actually go over well . also  if you  re looking for the perfect example of a santa  satan dichotomy on vhs tape  look no further . don  t check out this movie  as i  ve been notified the mst  k version is now available . move over satan  here  s  santa claus  .  ,0

this stirring western spins the tale of the famous rifle of the early west that was coveted by one and all . james stewart is the cowboy who wins the prized winchester in a shootout  only to lose it in a robbery . the story details stewart  s pursuit of the rifle and a certain man through the film . the rifle changes hands time after time  as though the owner is fated to lose it through violence . the picture has plenty of action and suspense as stewart closes in on his quarry . a great cast supports stewart here  namely stephen mcnally  dan duryea  millard mitchell  john mcintire and jay c . flippen . shelley winters seems miscast here and the purpose of her role is rather obscure . tony curtis and rock hudson  teen heartthrobs in later years  have brief but good roles .  ,1
this movie is just plain bad . weak story  weak directing and below average acting . the thing that really irritated me was the blatant advertising  constantly  for a well known internet provider . it is obvious some scenes are written to do just that  advertising . this movie is a slap in the face to anyone who payed money for this .  br    br   do not watch this  it not worth your time .  ,0
i loved this movie . it was so well done  great acting and drama and historically accurate . i love romy schneider movies . this one rocks  not as great as sissi but still rocks   br    br   and scorpiolina  she commented and said french dubbing . well this is originally a german movie not french . so yea . second of all there was a plot  maybe your not familiar with history . oh and her mother played the part of her governess  not her teacher . and the storyline was actually not cinderella but queen victoria  maybe u missed that detail .  br    br   but anyway . . . . yea the history in this movie is great  i love historical movies and queen victoria is very fascinating  i love all the historical stuff . like that guy that was trying to manipulate her mom . and when she ran away and met her future husband and he showed her the  new type of dance  waltzing . when waltzing was new it was considered kinda scandalous because the couples dance so close . yea her governess was like oh my god   br    br   and also the clothes  i love the clothes . the styles are great  hoop skirts are awesome . and of course romy always looks very pretty .  ,1
not for people without swift mind or without a drop of balkan blood in their veins . if you don  t have any of these you can not understand it . and if you don  t understand  you can  t enjoy it .   for example if you think picasso is a name of a car produced by citroen  probably if you see a picasso  s painting you just will walk by it  deciding that it  s a trash  work of some street painter .   so do not judge  before trying to understand it   in the end i think it  s a must for every one with open minds . still my n  remains the shawshank redemption  and remember that not all things can be put in frames . because there are things in this world  that any frame just won  t fit .  ,1
spoiler   i love branagh  love helena bonham  carter  loved them together in  mary shelley  s frankenstein   but this   br    br   i can understand an actor  s desire to stretch  to avoid the romantic stereotype . well  they did  but really  the script droned on  bonham  carter  s clothes were tres chic  and the occasional speeded  up  madcap  sequence could have been an outtake from a beatles  movie  or the old rowan and martin laugh  in .  br    br   i never got the point  other commenters say the branagh character was a dreamer . i never felt that . he was a loser  and not very bright  and certainly not endearing . the business with the bank robber disguise was merely painful to watch . certainly not amusing .  br    br   bonham  carter  s realistic  one supposes  attempts as realistic speech were harder to understand than the first   minutes of lancashire accent in  full monty .   br    br   the poetic ending  with him high on a hill with her buried under the monstrosity of his airplane was too orchestrated . was there a choir of angels  or merely a soundtrack   br    br   go back to the classics or something with a spine and an arc to it . donate this to pbs .  br    br    ,0
a sequel to angels with dirty faces in name only  the angels wash their faces suffers somewhat from the usual shenanigans of the dead end kids . as a matter of fact  with the presence of the dead end kids and ann sheridan this should have been treated as an actual sequel to angels with dirty faces  at least for continuity  s sake .  br    br   speaking of ann sheridan  she is the one true shining light of this movie . to paraphrase a clich  ann sheridan could read from a phone book for two hours and i would buy the dvd   br    br   another virtue of this movie is the chemistry between ann sheridan and ronald reagan . unfortunately  this aspect of the film is kept too far in the background . for a better example of the sheridan  reagan duo i would recommend juke girl or kings row .  ,1
this movie is similar to darkness falls  and the boogeyman       but it  s also much more graphic than both  and not as good as either . it  s also slow and fairly predictable . it  s also got shades of deliverance and the amityville horror . plus  we get some new age flavour thrown in the mix and some of those scenes come off as a motivational  inspirational sermon . really  this movie is a hodgepodge of almost everything . even though it is gory  the makeup effects are not very realistic looking . in fact they look kinda cheap . aside from all that  there is some really awful clichd dialogue . and i won  t say when  but there is a point where a couple of the character  s actions were not authentic or believable  given the circumstances . nobody in their right mind what would have acted this way . once you watch the movie  you  ll know what i mean . there  s also some gratuitous nudity for nudity  s sake . it just wasn  t necessary at all . the good news is that the acting was actually pretty good . better than this movie deserves . so  after carefully weighing the evidence  id say this movie was passable  but not good . my verdict for the tooth fairy      ,0
i watched lion king more times that all my friends put togther . having a baby sister . . you know how it is . by now i memorized both the plot and the lines . after lion king  came out i was like ok well let me see . . . the second one was significantly weaker . . . then i saw an ad for lion king  and    . . . i was like ok there we go again . after watching the     i was like wow . all my expectations  for repetitevness  were broken . a truly lovely and original plot keeps you glued to your seat for the entire time . i have noticed that the cartoon was filled with so many comical moments that roflmao will apply here     .  br    br   i definetly recommend seeing the cartoon .  ,1
the idea ia a very short film with a lot of information . interesting  entertaining and leaves the viewer wanting more . the producer has produced a short film of excellent quality that cannot be compared to any other short film that i have seen . i have rated this film at the highest possible rating . i also recommend that it is shown to office managers and business people in any establishment . what comes out of it is the fact that people with ideas are never listened to  their voice is never heard . it is a lesson to be learned by any office that wants to go forward . i hope that the produced will produce a second part to this  idea  . i look forward to viewing the sequence . once again congrats to halaqah media in producing a film of excellence and quality with a lesson in mind .  ,1
this review contains spoilers for those who are not aware of the details of the true story on which this movie is based .  br    br   the right to be presumed  innocent until proven guilty  is a basic entitlement of anyone in a civilised society but according to fred schepisi  s partisan but sadly convincing story of a famous australian murder trial  it was not granted to lindy chamberlain  accused of killing her baby . the story suggesting her innocence was unlikely  a dingo was alleged to have taken it   but those implying her guilt even more so  and there was no solid evidence against her . but the australian public was transfixed by the possibility of her guilt  and the deeply religious chamberlains appeared creepy when appearing in the media  and the media themselves  of course  were anything but innocent in this process  . so although cleared by an initial inquest  they were later prosecuted and convicted . although chamberlain was eventually released  this shamefully only followed the discovery of new evidence  proving  their innocence  something no defendants should have to produce .  br    br    a cry in the dark  is well acted throughout  especially by meryl streep  who puts on a convincing australian accent  at least to this pom  s ears  and manages keep lindy sympathetic  to us  while still conveying how she managed to become a national hate figure . the scenes where she actually gets imprisoned are simple but heartbreaking  because we believe in the characters as real .  br    br   regardless of the accuracy of its portrayal of this story  something i can  t comment on   the wider theme of this film will ring horribly true to anyone with a passing knowledge of the british popular press and its ruthless habit of appealing directly to their readership  s least charitable instincts . no legal system will ever be perfect but the current cry against asylum seekers in contemporary british tabloids comes from exactly the same pit of evil as the voices that put lindy chamberlain away . i  m not a religious man  but the bible still contains some killer lines  if you  ll excuse the pun  .  judge not lest ye be judged  is one of them .  ,1
anyone who visited drive  ins in the     s    s  and   s  must have seen a film or two by american international pictures  a distributor that resembled     s giant cannon films . wherever movie  goers ventured  aip would be right there to supply the latest en vogue titles  in the   s came horror movies like  voodoo woman  and  the undead  in the   s were frankie avalon  annette funicello beach comedies and biker flicks like  the glory stompers  and into the   s  aip churned out grindhouse  level trash like  cannibal girls  and  sugar hill .   br    br    dillinger   released in      is one of the more  highbrow  aip efforts that capture the true spirit of drive  in film  making it is one of those uneven  over  the  top flicks that satisfied the masses  thirst for entertainment  craftsmanship and common sense be damned . on the whole   dillinger  is typical for its era entertaining and worth a couple of hours  but certainly not memorable . heavy on action and short on both acting and historical fact   dillinger  was a fair effort by screenwriter  director john milius   magnum force   but certainly left room for improvement in his extensive career .  br    br   the     minute  dillinger   epic for aip  s scope  follows the quest of fbi midwest chief melvin purvis  played by academy award winner ben johnson . purvis was the investigator who sought revenge for four fbi agents killed in a     kansas city ambush that helped gangster frank nash to escape justice . at large were the men who supposedly plotted that breakout  including expert bankrobber john dillinger  warren oates   pretty boy floyd  steve kanaly   and psychopath baby face nelson  richard dreyfuss  . dillinger eventually joined forces with floyd and nelson  taking along homer van meter  harry dean stanton  and harry pierpont  geoffrey lewis  . he also hooked up with billie frechette  michelle phillips   a prostitute of french and indian extraction . while taking place over several months in         dillinger  is basically a chase film  with purvis  s entourage looking to run down and kill off the men wanted by j . edgar hoover .  br    br    dillinger  has a documentary feel  listing dates and places while johnson supplies loose narrative as purvis . milius keeps an honest depression look  using authentic fashion  cars  weapons  and buildings he also sprinkles around black  and  white photography and stock footage of gangster shootouts . the film is never boring  moving at a quick  if haphazard  pace . the action scenes are dillinger  s strongpoint  edited competently by fred feitshans jr in his last professional effort . thousands of blank ammunition rounds must have been used to make this film  not to mention pounds of explosives . this film is certainly not for the squeamish  with people getting shot and dropping dead all over the place . the violence  while gratuitous  brings some understanding of the mayhem that organized crime dumped on american life .  br    br   this film never transcends its exploitation status  however  because the needed writing just isn  t there . john milius  somewhat overrated as a filmmaker  places way too much emphasis on action . the action scenes  mostly blood  filled shootouts  are impressive and comparable with any major crime film of its era  including      s  bonnie and clyde .  but we simply don  t get to know much about dillinger and his gang members as people the vital relationship that develops between dillinger and frechette is barely touched upon  with the pair meeting in a bar during one scene and cavorting as lovers just ten minutes afterward . melvin purvis also seems to wander in and out of the storyline  becoming a prominent figure only when milius needs to keep the film from unraveling . all too often  the film takes on a shoot   em  up persona when its characters could have been explored in detail .  br    br   aside from this  the picture  s main crime is ignorance of historical fact . while many say that  dillinger  is just a film  it  s films such as this one that create fables and make them permanent . those with knowledge of gangster history will point out that john dillinger was not the last of his ring to die  as milius  s screenplay and the film  s documentary style encourage us to believe . in fact  dillinger died before baby face nelson and homer van meter he also was said not to be carrying a gun on the night of his death  nor did he have billie frechette in tow . while these inaccuracies might make for high drama  there is no reason why milius couldn  t have stayed with the facts and written a great story around them .  br    br   warren oates  s performance as dillinger is quite good  although he sometimes looks unconvincing . oates is humorous and nicely portrays how dillinger became consumed by his larger  than  life image in the american press however  we never really feel the menace he invoked in his lifetime . ben johnson gives some life to purvis  suave but rather flat . michelle phillips brings emotion to the billie frechette character and it  s really too bad that milius  s screenplay didn  t flesh out her relationship with dillinger . we never learn what drew her to a cold  blooded killer  other than the stereotype of an easy  going girl who is attracted to men of danger . the supporting roles with kanaly  dreyfuss  stanton  lewis  and a briefly  appearing cloris leachman  are acceptable for such talent .  br    br   as a piece of     s exploitation   dillinger  appears doomed to retail bargain bins  which is exactly where i picked up mgm  s dvd release for   .   . the film is nicely presented in widescreen  a must for drive  in flicks  with subtitles in french and spanish . dillinger  s theatrical trailer is supplied as a lone extra . largely forgotten except by gangster movie fans and drive  in enthusiasts  the film doesn  t really call for much else in way of supplementary material . for fans of the genre  it  s certainly worth checking out .  br    br    out of   br    br   roving reviewer  www . geocities . com  paul  johnr  ,0

i used to watch this on either hbo or showtime or cinemax during the one summer in the mid    s that my parents subscribed to those channels . i came across it several times in various parts and always found it dark  bizarre and fascinating . i was young then  in my early teens and now years later after having discovered the great arliss howard and being blown away by  big bad love  i bought the dvd of  wilder napalm  and re  watched it with my girlfriend for the first time in many years . i absolutely loved it  i was really impressed and affected by it . there are so many dynamic fluid complexities and cleverness within the camera movements and cinematography all of which perfectly gel with the intelligent  intense and immediate chemistry between the three leads  their story  the music and all the other actors as well . it  s truly  cinematic  . i love arliss howard  s subtle intensity  ambivalent strength and hidden intelligence  i  m a big fan of anything he does and his interplay with debra winger  s manic glee  they are of course married  has that magic charming reality to it that goes past the camera .  i wonder if they watch this on wedding anniversaries  . . . . . . .  big bad love  should be the next stop for anyone who has not seen it it  s brilliant .  and  dennis quaid in full clown make  up  sneakily introduced  angled  hidden and displayed by the shot selection and full bloomed delivery is of the kind of pure dark movie magic you don  t see very often . quaid has always had a sinister quality to him for me anyways  with that huge slit mouth span  hiding behind his flicker eyes lying in wait to unleash itself as either mischievous charm or diabolical weirdness  here as both  . both howard and quaid have the insane fire behind the eyes to pull off their wonderful intense internal gunslinger square  offs in darkly cool fashion . in fact the whole film has a darkly cool energy and hip intensity . it  s really a fantastic film  put together by intelligence  imagination  agility and chemistry by all parties involved . i really cannot imagine how this got funded  and it looks pretty expensive to me  by such a conventional  imagination  less system  but i thank god films like this slip through the system every once in awhile . in a great way  with all of its day  glo bright carnival colors  hip intelligence  darkly warped truthful humor and enthralling chemistry it reminds me of one of my favorite films of all time  grosse pointe blank  . . . . . . . now that  s a compliment in my book   ,1
a previous reviewer said the movie is not all that bad . what       the movie glorifies child molestation . oh  but sylvia kristel was naked in it  so let  s give it  out of   stars . why not a full    because the filmography was  agonizing   the child  s looks of shock were  unrealistic   and the fat friend was  irritating .  nowhere in the review does the reviewer express any outrage that an american movie in     featured scenes of a child having sex with a grown woman . i happened to catch this steaming loaf of a movie while staying at a hotel that had showtime . to me  even if the fat friend had acted up a storm and was a deserving of an oscar  i would still have to give the movie only  star . that tv  s howard hessman starred in the movie at the same time as he was appearing in wkrp is particularly ridiculous . but don  t take my word for it   ,0

  so there  s this bride  you see  and she gets crushed to death by this statue that falls on her on the day of her wedding . then  get this  a year later  her former fianc falls in love with a beautiful psychic and then  that beautiful psychic gets haunted by the ghost of the disgruntled dead bride who wants to keep her from stealing her boyfriendhe heit  ll be hilarious  .  polite chuckling .  br    br   this  i like to envision  is how jeff lowell  the man who dreamed up  over her dead body   presented his concept to the studio execs over there at new line cinema . the big mystery is how those very same corporate bigwigs could then turn right around and green light the project  allowing lowell to direct the film as well as write the screenplay .  br    br   for if you think that no movie could ever possibly be as bad as this original premise sounds  then clearly you have another think coming . the only way in which it might have worked is if the writer had simply gone crazy with it and turned it into a no  holds  barred satirical farce . instead  wanting to ensure that he delivered a fuzzy  inoffensive and warmhearted romantic comedy  lowell engages in boring half  measures every step of the way  tamping down the absurdity in favor of drab conventionality . indeed   over her dead body  is so thoroughly inept and unfunny that it  s hard to know where exactly lowell thought he was going with it . virtually every set  up  joke and sight gag in the film is flat  footed and poorly executed  with even the actors themselves seemingly aware of their predicament . how else to explain the halfhearted  lifeless performances of paul rudd  eva langoria parker  lake bell and jason biggs in their various roles   br    br   i choose not to blame the actors  some of whom have proved their talents in better vehicles in the past  that is particularly the case with rudd  . but lowell and those studio execs sure have some  splainin  to do .  ,0

according to john ford  s lyrically shot  fictional biopic of abraham lincoln  s life his greatest faults may have been an obtuseness with woman and an ability to dance in  the worst way .  ford  s camera has only praising views to reveal of mr . lincoln  s early life . but for what the film lacks in character complexities it makes up for in beauty and depth of vision . uncharacteristically beautiful compositions of early film  what could have been a series of gorgeous still frames  ford has a unique eye for telling a story . the film sings of the life of a hopeful young man . henry fonda plays the contemplative and spontaneously clever lincoln to a tee  one of his best roles .  br    br   the film concerns two young men  brothers  on trial for a murder that both claim to have committed . in classic angry mob style  the town decides to take justice into their own hands and lynch the pair of them  until honest abe steps into the fray . he charms them with his humor  telling them not to rob him of his first big case  and that they are as good as lynched with him as the boys lawyer . what follows seems to become the outline for all courtroom  murder  dramas thereafter  as abe cunningly interrogates witnesses to the delight and humor of the judge  jury and town before he stumbles upon the missing links .  br    br   the film plays out like many john ford movies do a tablespoon of americana  a dash of moderate predictability  a hint of sarcasm that you aren  t sure if you put in the recipe or if ford did it himself . despite the overtly  hollywood  feel of the film  and overly patriotic banter alluding to lincoln  s future presidency  the film is entirely enjoyable and enjoyably well constructed  if you can take your drama with a grain of salt .  ,1
i loved the first two movies  but this movie was just a waste of time and money  for me and the studio  . i  m still wondering why they made this horrible movie . the thing with the plastic gun and with the toy car  that can go into another house are ridiculous . joe pesci and daniel stern in the first two movies were so funny  but the terrorists in this one are so stupid and not funny . believe me this movie is just a waste of time .  ,0
a reasonable effort is summary for this film . a good sixties film but lacking any sense of achievement . maggie smith gave a decent performance which was believable enough but not as good as she could have given  other actors were just dreadful  a terrible portrayal . it wasn  t very funny and so it didn  t really achieve its genres as it wasn  t particularly funny and it wasn  t dramatic . the only genre achieved to a satisfactory level was romance . target audiences were not hit and the movie sent out confusing messages . a very basic plot and a very basic storyline were not pulled off or performed at all well and people were left confused as to why the film wasn  t as good and who the target audiences were etc . however maggie was quite good and the storyline was alright with moments of capability .  br    br    .  ,0
jeopardy has the feel of being a stock movie of sorts  one of the movies that the studios pumped out inbetween big budget  box office ones . it  s a mere   minutes and doesn  t feature many sets  and the only star is barbara stanwyck . but what a star  of course .  br    br   stanwyck is a tough lady once again as she runs into an escaped convict while seeking help for her trapped husband in the mexican desert . the majority of the movie is focused on how she deals with her captor  who wants her to submit to him in exchange for his help . some psychological battling there .  br    br   it  s a surprisingly effective little movie  its short length makes it taut  and that stanwyck is great should go without mention  but i  ll still praise her every time  .  ,1
i went to see ashura as     fantasia festival kickoff . man  that was one cool kick off . the director was supposed to be in montreal for the canadian premiere  but due to health reasons  he  s still in japan . . . oh lord i hope he gets better and makes plenty of other movies .  br    br   the plot is pretty simple  but somewhat original . . . the demons are roaming in edo in japan and swordsmans called  demon wardens  are slaying them and fearing the rebirth of ashura  the demon goddess who  s sleeping and supposedly is very kick  ass .  br    br   it brings us to izumo . . . some kind of elite swordsman called  demon slayer  and his buddy jaku who  s the typical violent jealous asshole . . .  br    br   seems boring  well now it thickens . . . .  br    br   izumo took his retirement from killing demons since he slayed a young kid on the  impression  that he was the demon  he never knew  but he did killed her . so izumo went on with his life and recycled himself in kabuki theater . in a boat joyride on a nice night  izumo spots a girl hiding on a bridge and it changes his life and restart to slay demons . . . for the good cause  the cause of love . . . and damn . . . the guy knows how to handle a sword and to pull an entertaining massacre .  br    br   izumo carries the movie as far as playing goes . . . he is the total package . . . he knows how to fight  hell yeah he knows   he  s witty  he  s intelligent and he has that grit . you never have to yell   no izumo  it  s a trap  the guy already knows it he has that common sense . he  s really the perfect hero .  br    br   as far as cinematography goes  the esthetics are pretty interesting . it  s by far  the movie that looks the most like a manga . it  s creamed full of special effects and nothing  at all cost will prevent this movie to look realistic . . . it  s pretty amazing . lots of colours an  unreal  photography  other than that . . . it  s pretty straightforward . . . but like i said  the main character is carrying the movie a must see  a tale lead by masterful hands  ,1
what is  cry freedom  like  it is simply great and unique experience about making of south africa and how black people in that country were repressed by white people . main character of the story is donald woods  kevin kline   chief editor of the newspaper daily dispatch in south africa . woods writes several articles  where he speaks critically about views of steve biko  denzel washington  . soon woods meets biko and he changes his views about him and he also begins to understand what authorities are doing to black people in south africa  right from the top  even from the chief of police  . when biko dies in police custody  woods decides that he have to write book about him and that no matter what he has to publish it . but woods must escape from his country to get that book published and he must also put his family on second place  so world can find out the truth .  br    br   attenborough managed to make a good movie about people  with main message that black and white are the same  cause we are all people . story leads us to south africa and this  movie  is great way for the whole world to learn what happened in that land and i  m disappointed that only     people rated this movie . this is movie from which we all can learn something . although it is a bit long  this story couldn  t be presented in any shorter way because director wanted to show us how hard was for woods to get that book published after death of biko .  br    br   also relationship between woods and biko was shown great  just like families of those two people and all the problems they are going through . but sometimes sacrifices must be made  biko  s death  so the truth could be reveled  woods book  .  ,1
a must see by all  if you have to borrow your neighbors kid to see this one . easily one of the best animation  cartoons released in a long  time . it took the the movies antz to a whole new level . do not mistake the two as being the same movie  although in principle the movies plot is similiar . just go and enjoy .  ,1
broadway and film actor  turned  director john cassavetes  from rosemary  s baby  creates a masterpiece with this     film . it stars gena rowlands  john cassavetes himself  ben gazzara  joan blondell  paul stewart  zohra lampert  laura johnson and there is a cameo by peter falk . the premise of the film an aging stage and film actress  gena rowlands  re  evaluates her life after an obscessed fan dies in a car accident trying to get her autograph . the movie has a slow pace and a dark  moody  frightening quality . it has a    s cinematic look and it even reminded me of polanski  s rosemary  s baby without the supernatural horror . the fears here are the ones every successful actress has  she is getting old and she will become useless in her career . furthermore  she feels she has lived a life that lacks any true spirituality  humanity and merit . she has lived only for her career  she has no children  doesn  t do charitable deeds  etc . the gradual disintegration of her personality is the meat of this film . she is falling apart . she  s in a crisis . gena rowlands really gets into the character  s tormented psyche and acts the part quite well . she is a terrific actress and this    s film is a refreshing contrast to the often violent films of the period and or the disaster movies or adventure thrillers . it  s a movie with lots of deep  seated emotion but has a cold  cynical feeling  as if cassavetes is criticizing the mainstream movies and actors of the    s generation . either that or this movie is a product of the    s which was itself cynical in many aspects  nixon  s deception  watergate  vietnam  etc . although the production values are not great  and this film is not well  known  it  s a very haunting film with haunting moods . kudos to the underrated and late director cassavetes who died in the late    s .  ,1
i admit  the first time i watched even cowgirls get the blues  i didn  t think it was very memorable in any regard . but now after viewing it the  th time  i admit that it has very much grown on me . the characters of sissy  ms . jellybean  and the countess have become very endearing . and the romance between sissy and jellybean seems very sweet . though the plot is very weak  i think the satirical humor more than makes up for it . then there  s the kick  ass soundtrack which features the tremendously talented k . d . lang  who reminds me a little of patsy cline  at her best . i can  t think of any movie that has  grown on me  after an inauspicious first impression  as much as cowgirls has .  ,1
this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen it  s extremely boring with lots of boring dialog and has some very annoying characters and a laughable looking creature . the only reason i watched this piece of garbage is because it was on that  disc horror set i got . the plot is preposterous and totally stupid as is the finale . no blood what so ever except a few bloody marks on the creature  and a couple of bloody gunshot wounds . the acting is terrible   . richard cardella is terrible as the sheriff and was quite laughable plus his character is annoying . glen roberts is the comic relief and was not funny at all  . mark siegel is extremely annoying and was also not funny  . bob hyman is decent but not much more then that . richard garrison is annoying and had no chemistry with kacey cobb what so ever . kacey cobb is so so here and had no chemistry with richard . overall avoid this piece of garbage at all costs  bomb out of  .  ,0
with the exception of about   sublime minutes with hb warner on the celestial train  this was   minutes of jaw  dropping horribleness  the acting was atrocious  but the story is what i really found appalling . the acting was wooden and stilted  even by early talkies standards  the exceptions being lee tracy and hb warner  neither of whom can do wrong  . rose hobart was absolutely horrid and lifeless as julie  as she likewise was in      s dr jekyll and mr hyde  an otherwise excellent flick  . and the rest of the cast was worse  there being no words to describe their awfulness .  br    br   worse than the acting  however  was the story . for some unknown reason  julie loves liliom  a cad and user of women with no redeeming qualities whatsoever . he marries julie but doesn  t support her  instead lying in bed all day or hanging out with his low  life criminal pal  lee tracy  . and  oh yeah  he never has a kind word to say to julie and he regularly beats her . julie loves him nonetheless and continually makes excuses for him  which only seems to make him more abusive . what  s even sicker is that this movie presents this story to us as a love story . somehow we are supposed to see julie as a noble character whose pure love redeems liliom . wtf   br    br   the last    of this movie takes place after liliom has killed himself  a robbery plot goes awry and liliom plunges a knife into himself rather than being taken in by the police  . as he lay dying  he tells julie  i beat you all the time  but i  m not sorry for it .  when he at last dies  she finally tells him she loves him .  neither character ever said  i love you  to the other while they were alive .  after his death  god  s chief magistrate gives liliom one more day on earth so that he can  do something good  for his unborn daughter . the price for this is   years in hell . after   years  liliom is allowed one day on earth to see his now    yr  old daughter . he approaches her in the front yard of her home and tries to cajole her into letting him  do something good  for her he tries to get her to play cards  he tries to give her gabriel  s horn  but she  s not interested and rebuffs him . so he slaps her . he . slaps . her . and then he disappears back to the afterlife . looking on  we see his daughter tell julie about this . the girl says the slap didn  t hurt  that it felt like a kiss . this is supposed to be the movie  s magical moment . the girl asks her mother if such a thing is possible  and julie replies that  someone can be beat you and beat you and beat you and not hurt you at all .  then the music swells and liliom rides up to heaven in the celestial train . blech   br    br   there was one saving grace to this film  and that is the interview between the chief magistrate  hb warner was truly magnificent here  and liliom on the celestial train . the magistrate had some very profound things to say to liliom about life and second chances and death . this scene alone made me bump this rating from  to  stars . regarding liliom  s suicide as a means for escaping his problems  the magistrate says  people suppose that when they die  their difficulties are ended for them . you thought that by killing yourself that you would cancel all your responsibilities . it is not as simple as that . on earth your name is still spoken your face is still remembered . as long as one is left who remembers you  so long is the matter unended . until you have been completely forgotten  you will not be finished with the earth  even though you are dead .  some great sublime transcendental stuff amongst some of the most horrible trash i  ve ever seen .  br    br   by the way  this story has apparently been filmed many times both as  liliom  and as the musical  carousel .   ,0
this movie is a fantastic movie . everything about it in my opinion was top notch from the acting to the directing . i know mr . garfield was blacklisted in the      s but the majority of his other films are on video if not dvd . that being the case  why isn  t this one  a friend recorded it off of tcm for me but to have it on dvd would be great . for special features they could have say a marine historian talk about the battle and if mr . schmid  s wife or son are still alive they could be interviewed as well . anyway this is a great movie and i highly recommend it . if it ever is put out hopefully it won  t be colorized . colorizing it would in my opinion just ruin the whole effect of the film . the battle scene was quite realistic as far as a      film would go . mr . garfield did a superb job of portraying mr . schmid . some actors might have been tempted to overact the part of mr . schmid  s disability but i feel he got it just right . i sincerely hope they come out with this movie on dvd someday as a tribute to the courage of al schmid and all the other marines who sacrificed so much for us in world war two .  ,1
i just finished watching this movie . it wasn  t ridiculously bad  but i  m really disappointed with it . i  m not really sure why someone would make a movie like this . it was marginally entertaining  but i feel like the people making it had a lot of disagreements on what they were making . monday  the writer was in charge tuesday  the director wednesday  the guy who gets the coffee etc . it almost seems like they really wanted to make a couple different movies  but only had the time and money to make one .  br    br   someone else commented that the acting was really good  but i  d have to disagree . then again  if the actors were able to keep a straight face during the filming  perhaps they  re better actors than i give them credit for .  br    br   the back of the dvd gives the impression that the movie would be a mystery . . . something along the lines of a historical law and order or national treasure . it starts off like that  but then  out of nowhere it takes a turn towards a bad episode of the twilight zone  or . . . what was that other show that wasn  t as good . . . a bad episode of the outer limits .  br    br   my main complaint about the movie is that it is just so played out . there  s the evil guy with spiked white hair . there  s the love interest  who  when she first appears  the wind actually blows through her hair . seriously . once you realize it  s a christian movie  the end is also pretty easy to spot .  br    br   the cinematography was poorly done  especially in the opening scenes  way to put your best foot forward . it wasn  t atrocious for most of the movie  but there was the occasional ridiculously bad shot of an old lady  praying  arms up in a dark room while lightening is striking  the sort of thing that just makes you a little bit embarrassed to be watching the movie .  ,0
as other viewers have mentioned  this film was an interesting experiment in photography . the colors are comic book bold . i think the director got carried away with his  artistic vision  over the look of the film instead o badly needed attention to content . despite its stellar cast  the performances are lackluster and the story nearly incoherent . madonna was likely cast purely as a stunt to get pre  release press . a good thing as her appearance here lent some credence to her album  i  m breathless  music inspired by the film dick tracy   which was a stratospheric hit  due in large part to the inclusion of dance  hit  vogue   which is not in  nor has the slightest relation to this film  . i  d guess the major portion of money from this film came from tie  ins to madonna  s  i  m breathless  album .  br    br   if you watch it at home  by end  titles  you  ll think  there  s two hours out of my life i  d like to have back .  save yourself the wasted time  do not bother with this .  ,0
what a dog of a movie . noni hazelhurst  s performance is quite good  but it sits amidst a jungle of abhorrent scriptwriting  mediocre direction and wooden acting from the bulk of the cast . many of the characters are woefully miscast  particularly the ever overrated colin friels .  br    br   very little works in this pretentious garbage . much of the  character development  is done through a silly  angst  ridden voice over and frequently completely contradicts the behaviour of characters on  screen . in fact  it  s hard to even figure out who the voice overs are talking about because they describe such different characters to who we see on screen  how are we meant to know colin friels  javo  is meant to be an erratic  violent and unreliable junkie  one of these silly voice overs tells us . for crying out loud  the nature of his character is half the point of the movie and the only thing that lets us know is a flippin  voice over  the real killer is the characters . everything about them . their clothes are perfectly maintained and look fresh from the rack  despite the fact we are constantly reminded they are meant to be artsy paupers . they are all absurdly well  spoken for  junkies  . none seem to have any real comprehension of life on the skids or on smack and yet this is meant to be the case with most of them .  br    br   monkey grip deserves no more attention than a weekday tv movie matine . crud like this  perfectly well shot and technically presented  but a clich  driven angsty drama that shoots so wide of being plausible and meanders about for hours without really going anywhere . at least noni gets down to her birthday suit at every given opportunity . there  s no other sane reason to endure this junk .  ,0
i recently bought the dvd  forgetting just how much i hated the movie version of  a chorus line .  every change the director attenborough made to the story failed .  br    br   by making the director  cassie relationship so prominent  the entire ensemble  premise of the musical sails out the window .  br    br   some of the musical numbers are sped up and rushed . the show  s hit song gets the entire meaning shattered when it is given to cassie  s character .  br    br   the overall staging is very self  conscious .  br    br   the only reason i give it a   is because a few of the great numbers are still able to be enjoyed despite the film  s attempt to squeeze every bit of joy and spontaneity out of it .  ,0
a fun concept  but poorly executed . except for the fairly good makeup effects  there  s really not much to it . there are obvious problems for example  after taking what seems to be weeks and weeks to get from fat to normal size  the main character seems to go from normal size to deathly thin in days . . . and once he  s deathly thin he stays pretty much equally deathly thin for what seems to be a long time .  br    br   in any case  the movie has far worse problems than that   the cinematography is decidedly low  budget  tv  show quality and most of all the acting is pretty awful all around . robert john burke seems to always be trying for some kind of weird snarling charlton heston impersonation and is literally painful to watch . . . the only scary thing is that lucinda jenney and kari wuhrer are both even worse .  br    br   the only reason why i  m giving this movie as high as i am is that once the movie enters its last    or so and joe mantegna  s character takes over  the movie develops a fun  campy  cheesefest slaughterhouse  feel  and the gangster  s crazy schemes for tormenting the totally obnoxious gypsies are somewhat fun to watch . the ending  if predictable  is also nicely mean . avoid unless you  re a king  o  phile or are really psyched up at the idea of the voice of fat tony from the simpsons terrorizing a gypsy camp .  ,0
this movie should be shown to film school students as an example of what not to do . the original kicked some major tire squealing butt  this horrible disaster breaks the cardinal rule of bruckheimer films  which is we all know they suck  but they have great action . this film has no action . this film is boring . where are the cars  where are the chases  where  s the tension  where  s the suspense  where  s the rush  where     this isn  t really a movie at all  it  s a bad commercial .   cars in   hours  that is wrong . they have  days to steal them  the ad is wrong . how bad is that  the leads acting is stiff  wooden and forced . the villain  the cop  the others . . . who cares . they utter their pointless lines  they serve the illogical plot . they slog through it the best they can as the music video director says  don  t worry we  ll make a lot of fast cuts and no one will notice how bad the film is  or  we  ll fix it with lots of loud music  the  script  isn  t really a script at all  it  s more like a list of cliches with an ending that is a total ripoff of        warning  possible spoiler                                       the fugitive . the biggest crime of all is the underuse of vinnie jones  man . . . . this is the baddest  coolest mofo since jules in pulp fiction . and what do they do   they make him a mute who  s hardly in the film  make vinnie the main villain and he could have saved the film . how could they have been so dumb  how  how  why  the original film is very entertaining with a cool trick at the end that gets the driver away . the original has a great   minute chase that delivers  go find the original . or if you  re craving some real car chase action go rent ronin . the chases in ronin raised the bar by which all other car chases will now be judged . bruckheimer and cage had all that money  all those resources  all that experience  and they can  t even come close to matching a film made   years ago for          how can that be  you feel like you got ripped off after seeing this movie . where i was once excited to see coyote ugly  remember the titans and pearl harbor  now i say god help us all .  br    br    ,0
there were a lot of things going against this movie for me before i watched it .  br    br   first  i was a typical high school senior  in a shakespeare class i didn  t really even like  much less understood half of  shakespeare would be no more than unintelligible without me pouring all my concentration into his almost encrypted plays . . . encrypted with his extremely difficult to understand language . . . . and then i still wouldn  t get most of it .  br    br   second  it was  hours long  i never thought that could be a good thing .  br    br   well let me tell you something . this movie was so masterful  so beautiful  i actually understood all the language as it was being performed . now  the script was followed to the letter in this movie  the same script that was incomprehensible to me in shakespeare class . and here i was my mind opening and me understanding it . i was doubting myself while watching the movie almost  but lo and behold . . . when performed  and only then  shakespeare comes to life . so this version of hamlet showed me that shakespeare is indeed a master  who wrote great stories . when i saw it on the big screen  especially in the high budget major motion picture style  with beautiful cinematography and photography   and acted amazingly by brannagh and cast  somehow . . . . i understood what was going on . what was being said . the language is awesome and passionate . it allows for more raw emotion . . . when words can  t describe something  maybe shakespeare  s words can .  br    br   i still hold to this day that fist of the north star  animated  english dub  is the greatest movie ever made . no movie provides more sheer entertainment . but for a movie to come close to dethroning fist from that position  which hamlet did   it came close  is truly amazing . . . . awe inspiring . it wasn  t a movie . it was an event .  br    br   even more amazing  it made me appreciate shakespeare . wow . powerful . powerful is the word . one of the rare  truly powerful movies out there .  br    br   this gets  hundred trillion stars out of infinity stars . yes yes .  br    br   by the way  all you kids out there in a shakespeare class . . . forget it . you  re wasting you  re time . you have to see the plays performed . only then will justice be done to them .  ,1
i totally agree with the review by a reviewer of variety that the film is never quite as funny  lively or insightful about the creative process as its premise would seem to warrant . narratively it is messy and the lighting is really problematic . if the film is supposed to be character  driven the poor lighting doesn  t enhance the acting and it is sometimes difficult to observe the facial expressions of the actors . many non  south africans will have difficulty in following the spoken english in the film and some of the local humor will be lost in the process . i watched the film at the cape town world cinema festival last year . comments and reactions to the film ranged from unwatchable and sloppy to a welcome departure from the films about our painful past . unfortunately bunny chow won  t be remembered as one of the bright lights of the south african new wave  but some of the remarkable films about our apartheid history will indeed be rated among our best in our    year old film history . not surprisingly the film disappeared from cinemas in cape town only two weeks after its release and from most of the cinemas in durban and gauteng . it has clearly limited appeal among south african audiences .  ,0
this is an absolutely charming film  one of my favourite romantic comedies . it  s extremely humorous and the cast is wonderful . though laurence olivier is mostly associated with his shakespearean work he shows in this film that he is by no means restricted to play only classical theatre . he manages the transition from the cynical divorce solicitor  who tries to avoid women and their traitorous ways  to the lovesick puppy that falls for lady x played by merle oberon effortlessly . the dialogue is wonderfully witty and refreshing and the atmosphere enchanting . ralph richardson was a delight to watch as well . i highly recommend it .  ,1
during the first  seasons fairly odd parents was as tasty as hard candy  bright and sweet and addictive . now it  s as tasty as pepto  bismol . and unfortunately pepto  bismol is what you  ll need after viewing the more recent episodes  where all the sweetness has been replaced by insults and violence resulting in no laughs . cosmo  once one of the more endearing nick characters  has devolved into an abusive unfunny cretin that the cast of family guy wouldn  t even want to know . timmy has become a selfish arrogant jerkwad that bart simpson would happily beat the snot out of  and given timmy  s snottiness  that would take a lot of beating  . and poor wanda . . . a real charmer who  s become the victim of her husband and godchild  she  s now labeled a  nag  for caring about the well  being of others . plus cosmo  s stupidity causes pain to everyone else but he  s never punished for it  nor does he learn any lessons . which pretty much sums up butch hartman  s attitude towards kids they  re crude  vulgar and not too bright . thank god this crummy toon has been cancelled  along with butch hartman  s darling  danny phantom . at least butch got what he deserved  unlike cosmo .  ,0
this is by far the most incredible movie i have seen in a long time . the actors gave wonderful portrayals of the characters in the movie . the story was accurately portrayed . the story starts out with a young woman from the british isles and her father traveling by steamboat to nauvoo  illinois . she has become a member of the lds church and he has not . he thinks she is ridiculous for making the trip and is discouraging . she encourages him to read about joseph smith  the prophet . this is where the story of the prophet joseph smith begins . the movie accurately portrays his life and some of the history of the lds church at the same time . it was graphic at times  but was needed . the emotional expression was very believable  which caused my emotions to spill out . filming was awesome . the way in which the story was presented was touching . after the movie was over  we just sat there unable to moved . i was stunned . for people who know very little of joseph smith  the mormon prophet  i would encourage you to see this . if nothing else but to gain some understanding of his life . for those who are members of the church  i would encourage you to see it . it will increase your testimony of this most incredible man . this is a must see .  ,1
now look  i won  t lie to you  but i only got this movie for   .   from a friend because it had danni filth  the lead singer of the ever popular death metal band  cradle of filth  in it . i expected of course violence and gore at its finest  as that is what mr filth can be portrayed as  amongst a plot line .  br    br   but dear god  i was oh so wrong . this movie seriously bites  big time . being a low budget film  haha  wait  make that zero budget   this obviously lacks the beautiful howard stern orchestra musical scores and the spielberg special effects . nope  it  s all one camera  bad angles  and bad blood scenes .  br    br   take for example when our star and violent fiend  mr filth  violently kills a mugger . a grab at the throat  and blood spits out  but oh my  it looks like there  s a juice packet filled with fake blood in the man  s shirt .  br    br   to you cradle of filth fans you  ll hear two songs throughout the movie  but with the camera angles and shoddy filming  they drag the overall pleasure of the song down .  br    br   my final comment steer well away from it . it  s blood  gore  breasts  and hey  even a shoddy story to go with it . so if you like appalling violence  near no voices  yes  there  s hardly any words in this movie   then by all means  buy it . but if shoddy movies isn  t your thing  then avoid it . don  t waste your money .  ,0
oh god  what an idiotic movie  incredibly cheap with fake special effects  the creature is played by one guy in lame costume  and stupid plot . all dialogues are unbelievably bad and these actors  ha  ha  ha   . . . they  re simply ludicrous . for example i have never seen so annoying characters like in this junk  these dumb kids or pregnant woman with his husband and many more  . all in all  this is a great entertainment if you  re drunk . avoid it like the plague . am i drunk  i don  t think so . . .  ,0
i went into this expecting not to like it i figured it would be terribly worthy and earnest  and rather plodding and dull .  br    br   it  s actually far better than that  and i found myself really enjoying it . i don  t know too much about queen victoria beyond what most know  married to albert  who died young  and she mourned him ever after . seeing the circumstances she grew up under was fascinating in fact i found myself wishing i  d seen more of the story  and i imagine we may see a sequel at some point .  br    br   visually the film is stunning . the sets and costumes are incredibly lavish without being too gaudy and over the top . the acting is top notch from everybody involved .  br    br   in a word  it was great   ,1
when reading a review from another user  saying that it  s a terrible game  i could not stand idle and do nothing   br    br   well  this game is great  from the news clips  with two real persons  full of humour sense and credibility    to the story  i find it very good  i only complain about the enemies start blinking when they die  until they disappear and some frustrating situations on the leila vr missions  when riding the bike  here and there . . .  br    br   except that  it  s a great game  with a great story  good graphics  excellent characters  great soundtrack . . . i recommend it  surely  it can be a bit old  but still enjoyable  at least  on the dreamcast . . . but the ps  version shall be the same .  ,1
this movie was a fantastic comedy . it had a lot of comedians star in it like akshay kumar  rajpal yadav  paresh raval and john abraham .  br    br   rimi sen was good at playing akshay kumars wife and so were all the air hostesses . mr hot as mac  akshay kumar  and mr cool as sam  john abraham  are two fashion photographers who like the same girl maggie  neha dupia  . when john abraham cheats on his work he becomes akshay kumars senior and akshay kumar gets really jealous because his flat has to be given to john abraham and neha dupia starts liking john more . akshay kumar wants to be better than john abraham so he finds a flat and he is going out with three different girls  nitu chandra  nargis bagheri  daisy boppana  .  ,1
idiotic hack crooks  a babe  a safe  a plan and a baby . add them all up and you get the best comedy you  ve never heard of .  br    br   even with some a  list star power  at least a  minus . . . okay  b  plus   this movie got very little publicity .  br    br   but that does not diminish its genius .  br    br   terrific writing  solid delivery and a believable group of characters . some truly classic lines  and a fun twist at the end .  br    br   this is not some watered  down  nutty professor  comedy . these are low  life bad guys . they speak low  life bad guy language and they do low  life bad guy things . but they do it for your amusement and entertainment  and they do that well .  br    br   one of the best comedies i  ve ever seen .  ,1
be warned neither zeta  jones nor mcgregor plays the main part as the poster would have you believe . their roles are in fact minor .  br    br   the film stumbles badly between exaggerated comedy and realistic drama  with neither being really engaging . especially i find it impossible to muster much sympathy for the main protagonist  not to mention his screwball friends and sex obsessed fianc . the plot drags terribly  and i turned this one off after about     unusual for me  as i like to finish what i start . the good acting and beautiful setting takes it from  to  stars .  br    br        ,0
if you hate redneck accents  you  ll hate this movie . and to make it worse  you see patrick swayze  a has been trying to be a redneck . i really can  t stand redneck accents . i like billy bob thornton  he was good in slingblade  but he was annoying in this movie . and what kind of name is lonnie earl  how much more hickish can this movie get  the storyline was stupid . i  m usually not this judgemental of movies  but i couldn  t stand this movie . if you want a good billy bob thornton movie  go see slingblade .  br    br   my mom found this movie for   .   at wal mart . . . figures . . . i think i  ll wrap it up and give it to my grandma for christmas . it could just be that i can  t stand redneck accents usually  or that i can  t stand patrick swayze . maybe if patrick swayze wasn  t in it . i didn  t laugh once in the movie . i laugh at anything stupid usually . if they had shown someones fingers getting smashed  i might have laughed . people  s fingers getting smashed by accident always makes me laugh .  ,0
to make it short and not to spoil everything this film is about kip  giovanni ribsi   a car thief  who messes up a big delivery of stolen cars    in total  . he is then threatened to be killed by the man who gave him the order  . the objective now is to get   cars stolen in  days  with the help of randall  nicolas cage   a retired  booster and also kip  s brother and a couple of old friends of randall  s . as you can see this is the same old  big bro  needs to get lil  bro  out of trouble routine and of course randall is the best thief there ever was . of course as in all other movies there are also a few setbacks and surprises you never would have thought of  but at times it is predictable too  so there is nothing fancy about the story .  br    br   you are by now probably wondering why this is about   times the hot stuff  since there are only   beautiful  fast  cool and expensive cars to be stolen . well the other hot item in this film is sway  angelina jolie  who will be a big star  trust me    . she is not only very convincing in the role as a car theft  but she is pretty hot too . ok not hot as in pretty  but hot as in damn cool and sexy . she was very believable in this role  probably because she is some kind of a wild woman in real life too  don  t believe me  read her biography  and for the sexy part well just see for yourself man . i only know  that she plays the kind of girl i like in this film  because she is not too mainstream  a bit alternative look and she even comes with a tattoo .  br    br   ok the only downsides i felt while watching this movie was  that there is not very much action  there is one totally unrealistic scene  the story is only ok and that there are not much jokes . hey but after seeing the whole film i must say who cares . why must i say that  well because it was still entertaining had a couple of cool car chases good music some bruckheimer scenes  where the combination of music and the lines of actors make your eyes go wet   good actors who all did their jobs pretty cars one cool  wild  sexy lady  yes  i mean mrs . jolie  and last but not least very nice and cool tools to boost the cars with . so some downsides here but still a pretty good and entertaining movie . all in all the best way to describe this film is that it is an overall ok movie with a cool  feelgood ending .  br    br   as for nicolas cage  well he is actually one of my most favourite actors in the action genre nowadays after such good films as the rock  con air  face  off  snake eyes and finally this one . plus what actor has had so many good action  thriller  s in the last years and such successful ones  well no one    maybe jackie chan  but he is one of my favourites too . one thing that is true though about mr . cages bruckheimer films is that they keep getting worse . the rock  was a clear   con air was a nice  and this well this clearly is a  . not that that mark is bad . does it not show that his films under bruckheimer keep getting worse and that maybe cage has to think longer before he accepts a role in a movie and probably he should make a few less movies  no it doesn  t show us that  because almost all of cage  s films were successful in the last few years  except for  mm and bringing out the dead .  mm was not great  i admit that  but that was never cage  s fault and the story seemed good to me . about the latter film i can not say anything  cause i have not seen it yet . one thing though i know for sure  if bruckheimer would have asked me for those three films  i would have said yes to all of them . i would have said yes to the rock  because the story was great and because you would get to play with sean connery and ed harris . i would have said yes to con air  because there would be a lot of action in it  because the story was good and because you got to act with john malkovich and ving rhames . in this one i would have starred because i would have gotten a big paycheque  i would have been able to ride some cool and fast cars and because i would have been able to kiss angelina jolie  can  t wait to see her in that lara croft outfit  . this one was a good choice of mr . cage and it certainly was worth a look at in the theatre .  br    br    out of    ,1
this is one of my all  time favorite films  and while it may move too slowly for some  it  s well worth seeing . a corporate lawyer  richard chamberlain  is dragged into a case involving  city  aborigines  and this is no ordinary case . ok  a man has died but it wasn  t exactly a normal killing . there has also been a greater than average amount of rain lately  and the atmosphere of most of the film is somewhat claustrophobic  oppressive . the aborigines are harboring a secret and refuse to spill the beans . this has a lot to do with white men making assumptions about  city  vs .  tribal  aborigines  and of course no abo in the big city would practice tribal ways . uh huh . chamberlain is having strange dreams and he is somehow the key to what  s happening  although no matter how many times i  ve seen this i can  t quite grasp the exact connection . this is a very eerie and creepy film  and is a fine example of peter weir  s ability to create tension out of nothing . the ending is a little ambiguous but i take it literally  it  s the easiest way out and the scariest .   out of   and highly recommended .  ,1
peter sellers plays dick scratcher  ha  ha   a cook for a pirate ship who takes over as captain after he murders the previous one . although he  s witnessed a treasure being buried  he begins losing his memory and the treasure map he obtains becomes blank . thus  dick is forced to find someone who can see and communicate with ghosts  do you place an ad for that   and help lead a path to the treasure . it  s mind boggling how anyone could have bankrolled this pointless film . former goon spike milligan replaced medak as director  and given medak  s talents in the film the ruling class  you can probably guess which of the grainy  poorly lit scenes had milligan in the director  s chair . peter boyle makes a brief appearance in the film  s first   minutes as the doomed pirate captain . he  s probably quite thankful that young frankenstein was released the same year this was filmed and canned  so that he can keep this off his resume . franciosa looks dashing as the handsome power  behind  scratcher but he and seller both look pretty desperate  with even sellers  makeup and hair looking quite terrible . they had to know this movie was bombing even as they were filming it . with lines like these  i can understand any possible unease  br    br   pierre  about to be hanged  you  ll pay for this .  br    br   scratcher no  i won  t . i  ll do it for free .  br    br   and that  s one of the good jokes . it  s amazing to me that much of sellers prolific material is still in the vaults  but this was made available on vhs more than   years ago  how about someone stepping up to the plate and releasing in the us the well  received british tv program  a show called fred  starring sellers  milligan  and directed by the great richard lester   ,0
a single mother  diane keaton  finds herself working several minimum  wage jobs . when she gets fired  she finds that she is unable to support her sons  michael seater and colin roberts   the latter of whom has asthma . then she goes to her friend and starts selling drugs . soon enough  she gets addicted to the drugs that she is selling . her life comes crashing down  especially when her kids  namely her oldest son  find out the truth and threaten to leave her . then  she struggles to redeem herself with the help of her kids but can she protect her family from the drug lords who she worked for   br    br   wow  this lifetime movie has some of the best acting i have ever seen  diane keaton overacts a lot  and her character comes off as crazy but she was extremely convincing . she is much better suited to drama than to comedy . however  the best performance in the movie comes from michael seater  who plays her oldest son . he is perfect as the responsible son who is still young but trying to be the adult in the family . his acting was especially great in the scenes where he confronts his mom about the drugs . colin roberts  who plays the younger son  also does a great job .  br    br   a movie well worth watching  especially because of the acting from michael seater and diane keaton   ,1
care bears movie   a new generation isn  t at all a bad movie . in fact  i like it very much . yes i admit the dialogue is corny and the story is a bit poorly told at times . but darkheart  while very very dark is a convincing enough shape shifting villain  and hadley kay did a superb job voicing him . speaking of the voice acting  it was great  nothing wrong with it whatsoever . the animation is colourful  and some of the visuals particularly at the beginning were breathtaking . the songs and score are lovely  especially growing up and forever young  the latter has always been my personal favourite of the two . the care bears  who i do like  are adorable  and the human children are well done too . and the ending is a real tearjerker . all in all  harmless kiddie fun .     bethany cox  ,1
i would have left the movie halfway through if i hadn  t been with people who liked it . the movie is based on real incidents  but it  s so over the top it didn  t feel real at all . i have some psychological background  hang out with a lot of psychotherapists  and have known seriously crazy people  so it  s not that i think people like this don  t exist . but in the film  the only characters who seemed consistently human were augusten  s father  alec baldwin  and the young augusten  jack kaedin  .  although evan rachel wood was an intriguing diversion  very sexy with a wicked sense of fun  . there were a few amusing moments  but the overall tone of the movie was grim  bizarre  and nasty . what a waste of an outstanding cast  as i watched them go through their turns  i just felt like i was watching an acting class . this was brought home during the credits  when a couple of people were shown just sitting there  not acting  not talking . those few moments were more entertaining than the previous  hours .  ,0
rather than move linearly from beginning to end  this story line of a gay couple impacted by aids  orbits  in time around their  perfect day .  the film is organized as a life remembered in asynchronous fragments rather than in a sequential flow as one directly experienced .  br    br   the narration has its lyrical moments  particularly in describing the impact of loss anticipated or experienced . the dialog unfortunately lacks such grace . the script frequently compels the actors to say startlingly stupid or insensitive things that seem utterly out of character at the moment . on their second accidental encounter  clearly smitten with each other  sensitive phillip encourages a reluctant guy to tell him about his difficult week . but the moment guy begins to open up  phillip  an english major  blurts out  you  re not a crisis fairy  are you   later  watching his lover  s naked  chiseled body stride across the bedroom toward him  our young shakespeare in love begins to render the beauty of the moment in words   the way you cut through space . . . . i can  t even describe it    but lacks the verbal skills to complete his thought . this kind of drivel continues through the aids hospice scenes  bejeweled with lines like   what made me think death would be all neat and tied up with ribbons   and  you make florence nightingale look like nurse ratchet .   br    br   the film often suffers from a bruising lack of subtlety . unlikable characters are far more jarring and steamroller  flattened than they need to be . phillip  s thoroughly annoying friends   an arrogant trust fund brat and a whining  needy dweeb   maintain a running caustic diatribe about every one crossing their path . such patter could offer a writer a wealth of opportunities for clever social commentary  but sadly  their remarks are merely unpleasant  ungraced by wit or insight . it  s hard to know if our scriptwriter intentionally crafted intellectually limited characters or if he was simply running his tether  s perimeter .  br    br   the plot may be what most appeals to and resonates with those who praise this film . it does seriously explore      s us middle class gay life first encounters  courting  coupling  nesting  the complexity of open relationships  friction and fracturing  dissolution  physical abuse  rapprochement  forgiveness  terminal illness  death and survival . leads phelan and spirtas give fair to good performances rendering complex characters over time . their fetching good looks help explain both the chemistry that held these two together through insensitivity and selfishness as well as the chemistry that helped some some viewers overlook this film  s painful weaknesses . the decision to chop the plot arc into tidbits and present them in out  of  sequence flashbacks added complexity without any evident dramatic utility  and in several cases left the sequence and thus the implications of a given event unclear .  br    br   could i recommend the film  to sticklers for literary and technical quality  absolutely not  for easy going viewers in serious need of an aids survivor catharsis or in the mood for a guilty  pleasure tearjerker with a little eye candy thrown in  maybe . but better written alternatives exploring the impact of aids on relationships of that era include philadelphia  and the band played on  longtime companion  angels in america  an early frost  parting glances  love  valour  compassion  and even jeffrey .  ,0
this film quite literally has every single action movie cliche and all of them work to its advantage . straight from lethal weapon gary busey wisecracks  shoots and chuckles through this film with such reckless abandonment it can  t help but amuse and entertain . there are tanks  helicopters  machine gun battles  grenades and ice cream vans and if they aren  t good enough reasons to watch this film then how about the best one . . . danny trejo . and if you don  t know who danny trejo is then you probably won  t like this film .  ,1
this movie is really wack . there is really nothing nice i can say about it  besides the moral truth expressed in the film  s climax concerning people in the neighborhood participating in the fight against crime . besides all that  the film had nothing no good shots  no good acting  and no good script . i give this film a f and a  out   .  ,0
if you have seen friends  the writing will feel very familiar . especially the last  or  seasons of friends often share the same comedy setups .  br    br   the show is about a group of people whose connection is that they shared the same class when they were still rather young  about   years old i think  . now  they  re in their mid  twenties  and they meet again on a class reunion . this is where the series starts .  br    br   a typical episode deals with multiple story lines at once . they  re usually not connected in any way . each story line is cut up into multiple sections  which are then shown in a mixed order .  br    br   the sketches is where my problems lie with this series . as in the later seasons of friends  it  s often a rather silly setting with hard to believe situations . one of the main characters does something really stupid that  s hard to believe . the situation is then heavily exaggerated  as if it wasn  t silly enough . if you  re into this kind of in  your  face humor  then maybe you  ll like this series . for me it is a great turn  off .  br    br   the reason i started watching friends is because of the first few seasons . there are interesting and especially credible story lines  with some romance in it that makes you root for the characters . the class has none of this . the characters are simply too forced and stereotypes are pushed too far . it  s therefore not possible to relate to them and like them .  br    br   at least with friends  it took several seasons before it ran out of steam and the character traits were all milked out . but in the class  it seems it has run out of steam before it even started .  ,0
watching this last night it amazed me that fox spent so much money on it and got so little back on their investment . it  s the kind of disaster that has to be seen to be believed .  br    br   i  m sure that the first morning of filming raquel welch dusted off the shelf over her fireplace to prepare a spot for the academy award she would surely win for this daringly original movie . oops . that  s not what happened .  br    br   the infighting on the set was detailed in print by rex reed and this helped the movie attain a reputation before it was even released . when it was finally released there wasn  t the usual three ring circus of publicity . if i remember correctly  in houston it opened at drive  ins and neighborhood theatres and never played any of the big venues .  br    br   i lay most of the blame on director michael sarne  who was hot after having directed  the not all that good  joanna  a film with music about young people in swinging mod london .  br    br   if i recall correctly  fox wound up firing him and piecing the film together the best they could . that  s why scenes play out in no particular sequence and characters appear and then vanish . an impressive supporting cast  kathleen freeman  jim backus  john carradine  andy devine and others  is wasted with nothing to do .  br    br   to expand it to feature length there are numerous clips from fox movies featuring stars like carmen miranda  in amazing footage from the gang  s all here  andlaurel and hardy  who never dreamed they  d be playing in an x rated movie .  br    br   the x rating is due to occasional language numerous sexual perversions however  none of the characters seem to be having any fun . maybe somebody involved with the film had a warped puritan sensibility and figured that if they could make these things unappealing it wasn  t bad to exploit them .  br    br   this was one of the  youth  pictures that nearly bankrupted hollywood in the      s . one writer joked that easy rider  which was made for pocket change  was the most expensive movie ever made because so many films followed which tried and failed in the worst way to duplicate its success . sixtyish  once honored directors like stanley kramer and otto preminger made movies like rpm and skidoo in an effort to attract a young audience . white directors and writers attempted to make films to attract a black audience . those movies are locked somewhere in a vault and the two named and many others from that genre have never  as best i know  been out on home video or cable . they  re the studios  deep dark secret .  br    br   raquel welch  s performance in this is  all things considered  very good . with the right direction and script she could played the type of sassy liberated women rosiland russel and barbara stanwyck specialized in . she looks great and has awesome costumes . mae west is the liveliest seventy  something actress i  ve ever seen . on the one hand it  s kind of heartbreaking to watch her attempt to capture her glory from years gone by  but i  m sure she needed the money .  br    br   if you want to see a big budget x  rated movie from this era check out beyond the valley of the dolls  also from fox  because it doesn  t take itself seriously . it  s crazy kids playing with the equipment at a major studio . myra breckinridge tries to say something . there just wasn  t anyone who wanted to listen .  ,0
for anyone that loves predictable movies with an awful soundtrack  lack of dialogue  clichs up the wazoo  and also stereotypes that just happens to be typical of an american film  look no farther . dreamworks whether wanted to save money on acquiring voice talent  or really wanted to create an animated episode of national geographic either way  they succeeded in delivering a rather bland and boring movie . spirit stallion of the cimarron is a bore fest that sends mixed signals to kids and adults  and also fails to entertain despite the oh  so  cutesy theme of animals triumphing over humans . after looking past the wonderful animations  what you have remaining is nothing but a big mess .  br    br   spirit is about a stallion that from the beginning of the film looks like quite a handful  as he is a horse that cannot be tamed  calmed  nor controlled . because of this  he rises and becomes the leader of his group of high  spirited horses  which includes his mom . but  his life of freedom and running around comes to an abrupt halt as he is captured by a group of americans in the process of connecting the wild west with the rest of the country . during this  spirit  never actually named that throughout the entire film almost  befriends a courageous native american  and a fellow female horse  and also has a lot of run  ins with the cynical and cruel army folks that apparently don  t believe in giving up .  br    br   why must movies mix computer animation with traditional  it comes off looking rather meshed  something spirited away suffered from as well . best example is when a train is chasing after spirit you see the hand  drawn spirit running from a computer  animated train . it would look much better if it were one or the other  but not both unless you can really pull off some nice effects . beauty and the beast  s famous dance sequence uses computer animation  but it is nowhere near as obvious as the train or the snow in this movie . the opening sequence was the best  looking part of the film  kind of sad to see the rest of the movie slide a bit downhill in terms of quality . a little scene has multiple i mean multiple similar shots of just a general  s face  quite repetitive and annoying in my opinion .  br    br   the kids might enjoy this flick  but with lack of dialog  song  and motivation  it might be a perfect technique in making hyper children fall asleep . while disney becomes criticized for its animated musicals  they wind up becoming much more entertaining than a more realistic approach to telling a story like this one . bryan adams has no place in this movie  and why does hans zimmer stay away from using a western theme in this movie  when it is a story taking place in the old west  soundtrack sounds a bit off if you ask me . at least they are using realistic noises of horses  two points for that . yet  if you are going to refrain from making horses talk  why even have a narrator interrupt every so often  which just so happens to be the main character himself   br    br   native americans are nice  and the western folks are evil  native  killing  horse torturing  rowdy  psychopathic monsters that must be destroyed . more or less  this is what spirit is showing us . it reaches a point in which they are trying so hard for the viewers to hate the travelers of the wild west they even had a scene of several horses pulling a huge train up a hill  and another scene of them destroying an entire village of natives . now  the person spirit befriended happened to betray him  on more than one occasion  yet that is forgivable  apparently because he is not a soldier that or because he has the sassy female horse .  br    br   spirit isn  t exactly a victim we should feel sorry for the viewer is supposed to sympathize with spirit despite him putting his entire group of horses at risk  wreaking havoc  and even perhaps resulting in some off  screen deaths that are quickly shoved aside because oh no  spirit is in trouble  this film gets quite rhythmic  as we see in multiple instances spirit escaping from chains  kicking people around  destroying property  freeing horses  and then getting captured again    all in this same order too . the writers also seem to have an obsession with cliffs because they are sprinkled all over the movie for an old west film  they certainly have very little room to roam .  br    br   bottom line this is most certainly no disney movie  as a matter of fact that is a bad thing  even though it was what they were aiming for . so  instead of the typical musical  we get a boring film that becomes predictable  dull and slow in multiple instances . even the decent animation becomes inconsistent when the computer work gets thrown in . everything about this movie was just wrong from the ideals that back then americans that were not native were evil buffoons  to the soundtrack and musical score that just seemed so far off . kill bill vol .   which pretty much has nothing to do with the old west  has more of a western feel than this movie . do yourselves a favor and totally skip this by all means necessary . thank you .  ,0

on the surface  this is an above  average post  war romantic comedy . beneath the veneer  it is mgm character actor stunt  casting at its funniest .  br    br   the leads are straightforward  but all the secondaries are cast much against type . margaret hamilton  aka wicked witch of the west   edward everett horton  professional obsessive  compulsive fussbudget   and sig ruman  the marx brothers  nemesis in  night in casablanca  and the always  wonderful  night at the opera    playing a well  intentioned gang trying to bring the two leads together  instead of driving them apart as their  usual  characters would do .  br    br   it also pokes fun at many romantic  comedy conventions  which is another indication that this could be not so much a  straight  romantic comedy  as it is a wry send  up of the many post  war romantic comedies  their   dimensional  stock characters .  br    br   i  ve seen it only once  with interruptions  so i can  t be positive  but this movie may be one of those that worked better in the context of the time at which it was made  but is less successful now that viewers  see  these secondary characters through a completely different lens . i  m assuming this is the case when i give it  stars . i thought it was hysterical .  ,1
imagine pulling back the mask of a lethal assassin and finding barbara cartland there . . . that  s what happens with this film .  br    br   the opening showed promise  but soon it drops all pretenses of being a thriller  or even an imaginative love story  and the only reason they made this story becomes abundantly clear to fill a gap in their female viewing market by creating yet another re  hash of  mis  understood  brooding bad  boy   andrei  meets  innocent  whimsical beauty   paula  .  br    br   rather than waste any time in creating an original premise  the filmmakers went straight for the money  shot the bad boy being tamed by said whimsical beauty . thence follows a string of insincere and heavily  clichd love scenes sprinkled with pseudo philosophical  poetic fluff . andrei  s admission of being  eponymously  a  poet  is levered in to round out the perceived qualities a byronic hero should have  but even when we  re told in heavy  underlined writing who and what he is  it  s still difficult to believe it  or care .  br    br   for a byronic hero  antihero to work  the story needs subtlety  style and innovation  all of which are utterly absent here . this is not a modern day phantom of the opera  it  s just what happens when a weak and rather silly woman  with loose knicker elastic  dates a bad man  who  after meeting her  seems as dangerous as bunny slippers .  br    br   the performances might have saved this film  had they been any good the female lead is preoccupied with looking sexy and  otherworldly   no matter how forced or ridiculous and poor dougray scott appears to have been drugged as he shambles through his part . this is not his best work . the glimmers of interest were brought by jrgen prochnow as  vashon   and andrew lee potts as the young photographer  brother . a better movie would have offed the sister and kept the brother instead .  ,0
hardly a masterpiece . not so well written . beautiful cinematography i think not . this movie wasn  t too terrible but it wasn  t that much better than average . the main story dealing with highly immoral teens should have focused more on the forbidden romance and why this was . . . should have really gotten into it instead of scraping the surface with basically  because mom says we can  t .  some parts should have been dropped altogether or reworked to have more importance to the plight of the two main characters . couple times i was wondering if the writer  director was a fan of george lucas  classic american graffiti . not that it  s wrong to be a fan of that movie but to make your movie at times look like that  i mean come on  worst part of this was that madchen amick had such a small part  i mean double come on   she was the only one  in one or two lines  who actually tried a southern accent .  take a good listen  it was there even though her character was from california  doh    maybe if she was the star others could have followed and we would have had a more authentically sounding movie . oh well  what can ya do when you have a director who  s just a director and not an artist  also . too bad . overall i give this a b  and that  s being a little generous  cause i  m partial to ms . amick .  ,1
surreal film noir released soon after the  real   genre  defining classics  the maltese falcon    double indemnity  and  the postman always rings twice .  welles films shouldn  t be evaluated against others . he was playing by different rules . in fact  he was playing . this starts where other femme fatale films leave off  so the vaguely logical  but interesting  whodunit is embellished with a display of wellesian scenes  typical rapid  fire style   dialog  lots of  hard  boiled  philosophy   and unusual acting  good hayworth presumably intentionally one  dimensional  . to welles  genre  may have meant  formula  but he seemed to like using  mysteries  as backgrounds for his  entertainments .   ,1
ok  so i rented this clown  like  chainsaw  massacre  esquire film  not expected much  but i did like the novel approach to a serial killer film .  from the back of the box is the following synopsis   at first  it was just a joke  a myth around the campfire  for five friends staying at a remote cabin in the texas woods . but when they began to disappear one  by  one  replaced by scattered  bloodied body parts and voodoo effigies  the remaining few scramble for their lives . but he  s out there . and he  s sick . and all he wants is blood . . .  so obviously from the get  go it doesn  t make sense why is this clown in the woods to begin with  why a clown  why are their dolls with the word  food  drawn on them  why why why  hardly anything gets answered in this  hour   min . bore fest except where this clown lives . the characters are dumb guys  dumb girls  and a hell of a lot of bitchiness . one in particular is a girl whom they brought from a restaurant up the road  whom they thought they should help because she was getting hassled by some guy she knew . what warrants that as an excuse to bring a girl into your circle of friends or their cabin  she  of course  begins planting seeds of jealousy  having the men have sex with her by feeding their dumb minds everything they want to hear .  br    br   the music was an average affair  standard frantic keyboard music like in every horror film without differences  . the actors seemed to be brought from some soap opera the way they complained and whined about everything . the idea that the main guy in the film takes this girl to the cabin as their first date makes for a horrible date  but of course  she unrealistically gives herself to him on the first night of getting to know him . there was hardly a budget spent of anything  it seems  but there was a clown outfit and plenty of cheap    store dolls lying around in the woods  which was a horribly bland place to shoot this whole movie  been done too many times  . i was also waiting for the clown to jump into the house to kill the remaining  characters of the film  in through the glass maybe   but nothing exciting like that ever entered the film . i guess you were just supposed to like the clown being a killer or something .  br    br   i had to give the film a  . it was an interesting premise  clown as the texas chainsaw massacre character  essentially  and i  ll give them a star for acting serious all the way through when the movie could  ve totally been a b  movie  style video  but they opted for the more legitimate style of video . but ultimately  i probably would  ve felt like renting the killer klowns from mars video again before going back to check this out . ah  but that cover art . . . pretty awesome drawing .  ,0
after watching this  i had lost a little respect for christopher lee  this has passed over time  . this film was utter garbage . first  they tried to recreate the ending from the first  howling   with incredibly bad make  up . then they try to turn it into a sad excuse of a werewolf porn film  the plot sucks and the whole film is just awful     a brother of a werewolf victim from the first film  from the look of it  it was supposed to be dee wallace stone  teams up with lee and another woman to destroy the group of werewolves  lead by sybil danning  who seems to be naked all the time .  br    br   this is not even worth renting  unless you want to waste your time and money watching the nudity .  . try to catch it on cable instead . it would be so chopped up  it may actually make sense .  ,0
david and bathsheba is a lavish hollywood biblical picture produced out of   th century fox by darryl f . zanuck  directed by henry king and starring gregory peck king david  susan hayward  bathsheba   raymond massey  nathan   kieron moore  uriah  and jayne meadows  michal  .  br    br   the film is based around the second old testament book of samuel from the holy bible . it follows king david  who as a child had slain the giant goliath  and now we find him in adulthood as the second king of israel . a tough and assured king  david however has affairs of the heart causing great problems . for once he spies bathsheba taking a shower rebath  it  s the start of a journey encompassing adultery and betrayal a journey that will end in the judgement of god being called upon .  br    br   typically for the genre  david  bathsheba is a large  grandiose production . from its excellent set designs to it  s positively gorgeous technicolor photography leon shamroy  it has enough quality to warrant sitting along side the best the genre has to offer as regards production values . untypically  tho  the film is sedately paced and relies on    of its worth being driven purely by dialogue . this is not one for action fans or anyone who needs some swash to go with their buckle . this is a very humanist picture  in fact lets not beat around the burning bush here  it  s a biblical love story flecked with sins of the heart . but that is no bad thing at all  because breaking it down we find it  s very well acted peck has a stoic yet vulnerable thing going on real well  hayward is pushing it to the max  and it be a fine story directed with knowing skill by the often forgotten henry king . and although some of the dialogue is admittedly cringe inducing  the character flow is never interrupted as phillip dunne  s  the ghost and mrs . muir  oscar nominated screenplay holds the attention throughout .  br    br   sometimes a forgotten picture in terms of the biblical  swords  sandals genres  most likely because it is a talky piece that has heart as its main selling point   but really it  s well worth the time of anyone interested in the most lavish of genres .      ,1
i had intended to commemorate the   th anniversary of marcello mastroianni  s passing with numerous unwatched films of his that i own on vhs however  given my ongoing light  hearted christmas marathon  i had to make do with just this one  as it happens  it features one of his best performances  and he was justly oscar  nominated for it  with the film itself being likewise honored  . this was also one of   collaborations with that other most widely  recognized star to emerge from italy  sophia loren both  incidentally  are playing against type here  she as an unglamorous housewife and he a homosexual   br    br   by the way  the film  s title has a double meaning the leading characters are brought together on the historic day in which hitler came to italy to meet mussolini  the event itself being shown in lengthy archive footage   but it more specifically refers to the stars   brief encounter  in which they share moments of friendship  revelation and  briefly  passion  though each knows that a return to their normal existence is inevitable  which leads to the film  s abrupt bittersweet ending . this is virtually a two  hander  with all other characters  save for the nosy concierge of the apartment block in which the story takes place in its entirety  which include loren  s gruff and fervently patriotic husband  surprisingly played by john vernon  appear only at the beginning and closing sequences   still  the cramped setting doesn  t deter director scola  for the record  this is the  th film of his that i  ve watched and own  more on vhs  and cinematographer pasqualino de santis  so that the result  though essentially low  key  is far from stagy the camera is allowed to prowl the various sections of the large building  observing the proceedings intimately or dispassionately as the situation requires  but always keenly .  br    br   the narrative  of course  depends entirely on the performances of the two stars for it to be convincing  and they both deliver  their on  screen chemistry is quite incomparable   it  s interesting  however  that while loren walked away with the prizes in their home turf  it  s mastroianni  s moving yet unsentimental outsider  the film  somewhat dubiously  does seem to equate his sexual deviance with anti  fascism   who generally impressed international audiences   ,1
well  maybe not immediately before the rodney king riots  but even a few months before was timely enough . my parents said that they saw it and the next thing you know  the police got acquitted and la got burned to the ground . it just goes to show the state of race relations in america . the plot has white mack  kevin kline  and african  american simon  danny glover  becoming friends after simon saves mack  s life in the black ghetto . meanwhile  movie producer davis  steve martin in a serious role  thinks that gratuitous violence is really cool . . . until he gets shot . there  s also some existentialism in the movie mack and his family come to realize that they aren  t living as they really want .  br    br   it seems that  crash  has somewhat renewed people  s interest in race relations  but this one came out much earlier . maybe we  ll never be able to have stable race relations in this country . but either way   grand canyon  is a great movie . it affirms kevin kline as my favorite actor . also starring mary mcdonnell  mary  louise parker and alfre woodard .  ,1
designed only to annoy  or amuse  any self  respecting intelligent person . if the director  s intention had been for the viewer to dislike the title character  then it would have been okay  but i know that there is no such thing as a hollywood director who  d make a critique of america  s pro  marxist   s movement  especially not a filmmaker from the   s . there is so much idiotic dialog going on here  that sometimes i wondered if i wasn  t actually watching a comedy . you wouldn  t be at fault for thinking that this is a satire  that  s how nave the movie appears . spacek has been in her share of leftist movies which brings me to the obvious  inescapable conclusion that the redhead hick is one of those hollywood liberal morons . but  i mean  aren  t they all  nice boobs  but st for brains .  ,0

ida lupino was one of the few women to break through the directorial glass ceiling in hollywood under the studio system . not surprisingly  she also tackled proto  feminist themes that  when touched at all  were approached in so gingerly a manner that it was seldom quite clear what was being talked about . in outrage  she treats rape and its aftermath  and though throughout the short movie it  s referred to as criminal assault   she leaves  for once  no doubt about what happened .  br    br   mala powers  in her official debut  plays a secretary  bookkeeper at a big industrial plant she lives with her parents but is engaged to a swell guy  robert clarke   who just got a raise and now makes    a week . leaving the plant after working late one night  she finds herself being stalked . in the ensuing scene  the best in the movie  she tries to escape her pursuer in a forbidding maze of buildings and alleys but fails .  br    br   when she returns home  disheveled and in shock  the police can  t get much out of her she claims she never saw her attacker  who manned a snack truck outside the factory  . trying to pretend that nothing happened  she returns to her job but falls apart  thinking that everybody is staring at her  judging her . she goes into a fugue state  running away to los angeles on a bus but stumbling off at a rest stop .  br    br   waking up in a strange ranch house  she learns that she  s been rescued by tod andrews  a young minister in a california agricultural town . she lies about her identity and takes a job packing oranges . the two fall vaguely in love  but it  s clear to andrews that powers is keeping dire secrets . when  at a company picnic  she seizes a wrench and cracks the skull of jerry paris  who was trying to steal a kiss  the truth about her past comes out . . . .  br    br   it was a courageous movie to come out in      and that may explain and excuse some of its shortcomings . lupino never recaptures the verve of the early assault scene  and the movie wanders off into the bucolic and sentimental  ending up talky and didactic . yes  lupino had important information to impart  but she didn  t trust the narrative to speak for itself . her cast  pleasant but bland and generic  weren  t much help  either  reverting to melodramatic postures or homespun reassurance . but outrage was a breakthrough  blazing a trail for later discourse on what the crime of rape really is  and what it really means to its victims .  ,1
if the crew behind  zombie chronicles  ever read this  here  s some advice guys  br    br    . in a  twist ending   type movie  it  s not a good idea to insert close  ups of every death in the movie in the opening credits . that tends to spoil the twists  y  know . . .   br    br    . i know you produced this on a shoestring and  to be fair  you worked miracles with your budget but please  hire people who can actually act . or at least  walk  talk and gesture at the same time . joe haggerty  i  m looking at you . . .  br    br    . if you  re going to set a part of your movie in the past  only do this if you have the props and costumes of the time .  br    br    . twist endings are supposed to be a surprise . sure  we don  t want twists that make no sense  but signposting the  reveal  as soon as you introduce a character  that  s not a great idea .  br    br   kudos to the guys for trying  but in all honesty  i  d rather they hadn  t . . .  br    br   only for zombie completists .  ,0
a chance encounter between a salesman and a hit  man changes both their lives . this is an odd film that works  an impressive effort for writer  director shepard . in a daringly unglamorous role that is a far cry from james bond  brosnan is surprisingly effective as the lonely hit  man who starts to buckle under the stress of his job  but is unable to connect emotionally with anyone to help him cope . kinnear is equally good as the salesman  a decent fellow with a void in his life . davis is fine as kinnear  s flirtatious wife . mainly a character study  the film is rewarding because it feels fresh and unpredictable  an extremely dark comedy .  ,1
having read the reviews for this film  i understandably started watching it with a great deal of doubt in my mind that it would actually be any good . however  this is one of the best films i have seen in a long time . the majority of reviews that i had read  said that the complicated plot made it too hard to follow . and whilst some parts do leave you confused  the ending ties up so many loose ends that you feel like kicking yourself because you  ve missed so much . it  s not like  lock  stock . . .  or  snatch   in the sense that it isn  t that funny  in fact  it  s pretty dark   and it is a lot more intelligent  in the way that you see parts of scenes from different viewpoints  and  in one of the best scenes of the film  jason statham spends five minutes in a lift having an argument with himself  . the way in which it is similar to the two films i just mentioned  is that it is full of memorable characters  specifically statham  who gives a fantastic performance as the lead  and ray liotta  who spends most of the film in speedos  but gives a great performance none the less . if you  ve got time  and have time afterwards to think about the film  and even watch it again  you really start to see all the symbolism and hints that are laid out through the film . i think it  s fantastic  and that guy ritchie is a director on top of his game .  ,1
if you are looking for eye candy  you may enjoy sky captain . sky captain is just a video game injected with live performers . the visials are nice and interesting to look at during the entire movie . now  saying that  the visuals are the only thing good in sky captain .  br    br   after ten minutes  i knew i was watching one of the worse movies of all time . i was hoping this movie would get better  but it never achieved any degree of interest . after thirty minutes  the urge to walk out kept growing and growing . now  i own over     movies and have seen probably five times that number . yet  this is only the second movie i felt like walking out of my entire life .  br    br   acting    there is none . the three main performers are pitiful . jude law  also in the other movie i wanted to walk out on  is just awful in the title role . i would rather sit through ben affleck in gigli than watch law again .  br    br   paltrow tries so hard to be campy  that it backfires in her face . the last article i had read said that paltrow is thinking of staying home and being a mother rather than acting . after this performance  i would applaud that decision .  br    br   story    soap operas are better written . the story behind sky captain starts out bad and gets continually worse as it progresses .  br    br   directing    none . everything was put into the special effects that story  acting and directing suffer greatly . even  the phantom menace  had better acting and that is not saying a great deal .  br    br   i would have to give this movie a    out of     . avoid paying theatre prices and wait until video release .  ,0
i was expecting the movie based on grendel  the book written by john gardner in the late      s . it was based on the beowulf epic  but told from the perspective of the monster .  br    br   whatever you may think of gardner  s book  a movie based on the beowulf epic should not be entitled grendel  when it doesn  t say anything more about the monster beyond the few pathetic scenes in which the cg monster is shown as nothing more than a modified predator .  br    br   on top of this  the writers should also be punished for screwing up the original story so badly and contributing to the continued growing ignorance of mass tv audiences throughout the us .  br    br   typical hollywood to get this so wrong .  br    br   very disappointing and a complete waste of time .  ,0
i just want to make one thing clear  i love michael vartan  but this film really lets him down . his acting is still superb  he  s still as charming as ever  and he still looks great . but the film itself is a load of rubbish  natasha henstridge  i  m sorry to say it  comes over bit manly . . . you  re constantly waiting for her to run off with her best friend  who  s own sub  storyline is a little weird . myself and my family  who sat down and watched the film with me  were also put off by the soundtrack to the film at times the music just didn  t fit with what was going on in the scenes . however  even this was not the worst aspect of what i found to be a very disappointing film . i could forgive the leading lady  s butch  ness  i could forgive the freakish characters that were thrown in to the mix  and i could forgive the poor choice of musical accompaniment  but whose choice was it to cut out the whole middle section of the film and skip straight to the end    the ending was obviously planned from the beginning but how it gets there is left untold . if you  re a michael vartan fan skip this film buy yourself a poster instead .  ,0
i  ve always liked this john frankenheimer film . good script by elmore leonard and the main reason this wasn  t just another thriller is because of frankenheimer . his taut direction and attention to little details make all the difference  he even hired porn star ron jeremy as a consultant  you can make a case that its the last good film roy scheider made . i  ve always said that robert trebor gave just a terrific performance . clarence williams iii got all the publicity with his scary performance and he  s excellent also but i really thought trebor stood out . frankenheimer may not be as proud of this film as others but it is an effective thriller full of blackmail  murder  sex  drugs  and real porno actors appear in sleazy parts . what can you say about a film that has ann margaret being shot up with drugs and raped  a guilty pleasure to say the least . vanity has a real sleazy role and a very young kelly preston makes an early appearance . a classic exploitive thriller that shouldn  t be forgotten .  ,1
in this day and age of incredible special movie effects  this one was a sore disappointment . the actors seemed stiff and uninspired  as was the dialogue . westerns are not common fare for hollywood so much these days  but movies like  silverado  prove that somebody out there still knows how to make a good one . considering that  it is hard to conceive that anyone would go to any expense at all in releasing  much less creating such a weak film as this one . if you love and are looking for a good western  keep looking   ,0
phew   i don  t what to say . this is a film that could be really good a with a bunch of stoned viewers . some of the acting reminded me of john waters  early offerings . perhaps i should take that back   i don  t want to insult waters  ability as a director  storyteller .  br    br   i particularly loved the lawyer taking about the  full faith and credibility  clause . it  s  full faith and credit   by the way   br    br   this also reminds me of  the conrad boys   where the main actor is also the writer  director  film editor  etc . those sort of multi  involved undertakings such as that are probably best left to very seasoned film professionals who would have the technical ability  albeit a stunt  some might say  to pull something off like that .  ,0
as of this writing john carpenter  s  halloween  is nearing it  s   th anniversary . it has since spawned  sequels  a remake  a whole mess of imitations and every year around halloween when they do those  top   scariest movies  lists it  s always on there . that  s quite amazing for a film that was made on a budget of around         and featured a then almost completely unknown cast of up and coming young talent . i could go on and on  but the big question here is how does the film hold up today  and all i can say to that is  fantastically   br    br   pros a simple  but spooky opening credits sequence that really sets the mood . an unforgettable and goosebump  inducing score by director  co  writer john carpenter and alan howarth . great cinematography . stellar direction by carpenter who keeps the suspense high  gets some great shots  and is careful not to show too much of his villain . good performances from the then mostly unknown cast . a good sense of humor . michael myers is one scary  evil guy . a lot of eerie moments that  ll stay with you . the pace is slow  but steady and never drags . unlike most other slasher films  this one is more about suspense and terror than blood and a big body count .  br    br   cons probably not nearly as scary now as it was then . many of the goofs really stand out .  br    br   final thoughts i want to start out this section by saying this is not my favorite film in the series . i know that  s not a popular opinion  but it  s really how i feel . despite that it truly is an important film that keeps reaching new generations of film buffs . and just because it  s been remade for a new generation doesn  t mean it  ll be forgotten . no way  no how .  br    br   my rating     ,1
this movie was pretty bad . sci  fi is usually my favorite channel so i watch all the original movies that play on it . i really don  t know if this movie can be called original . starting a zoo  theme park on a remote island sounds pretty familiar . what was it  oh yeah  jurassic park . but this has sabertooth tigers instead .  br    br   the movie starts out with a few stereotypical college kids on an island doing some kind of treasure hunt . one of them ends up dieing a rather gruesome death with some of the worst special effects i  ve seen . the blood looked a lot like ketchup . also at the beginning there is a scientist who wants to make as many saber tooth tigers as possible for people to enjoy .  of them have already escaped and are going around eating the tourists  or the people invited to the island to see the tigers first hand . again  sound like jurassic park . probably the coolest thing was the     lb saber tooth who crawled around on his front legs killing the mad scientist with a tooth statue of sorts that somehow shrinks and goes through the guys neck . funniest death i  ve seen on tv .  br    br   the acting is extremely cheesy  the special effects are horrible . the cg tigers could almost pass for clay models  and even some of the sounds were off . for instance  when one of the college students is trying to escape  he uses an ax to break down a door  the ax goes into the door and about  seconds later you hear the sound . this movie was pretty bad . the cheesy deaths were quite funny though .  ,0
i went to see this movie with a crowd that consisted predominantly of  spiritual  new age types  who  quite unlike me  very much enjoyed this movie    although according to those that also knew the book  apparently there is a book that contains more of this nonsense   the movie is not quite as good . so  if you tend to think of yourself as  spiritual   believe in or at least can tolerate stuff like  aura  and  astral body   and don  t mind the frequent use of the term  energy  outside of the context of physics or technology  you might actually like the movie  and will likely even more enjoy whatever book it is apparently based on .  br    br   however  if you are mostly in touch with the physical universe  if your ability to suspend disbelief is easily exhausted by inane new age nonsense and plots based thereon  if in addition to that you have a low tolerance for cheesy lighting effects to denote the happening of spirituality  and perhaps even expect reasonable non  wooden dialog an acting  then this is my recommendation for you regarding this movie stay . away .  br    br   don  t even think about it . tonight  this movie displaced dungeons and dragons as the worst movie i ever personally saw in a movie theater  i do not count movies i went to see with the expectation of them being bad  such as plan  etc .  . at the same time  it raised the grand total of movies i almost walked out on to two  dd being the other one  . i do not walk out on movies  not even on this one  but i should  ve when i first saw the visual depiction of an aura  because the new age bs keeps on getting thicker and thicker from that point on .  br    br   the plot is about a group of people involving themselves with some old prophecies  in a quest for spiritual enlightenment and aiming at bringing mankind to the next step in its evolution . or something like that . they actually talk about this spiritual stuff being the next step in human evolution  which should make anybody who has even the faintest idea of what human evolution is cringe . the movie is shock full with whoppers like that . occasionally people beam to what they would certainly describe as  another dimension   or perhaps  another plane   only to become invisible to those around them who haven  t yet reached enlightenment . goodness .  br    br   at the end the director patronizes the audience by rolling the  insights  making up the prophecy  painfully slow  presumably so that we can memorize them and leave the cinema as better  more enlightened individuals .  br    br   good things about the movie  some very pretty nature shots  and some decent supporting performances by elizondo and de almeida .  br    br   i honestly can say that it seriously affects my ability to take a person seriously if they consider this movie interesting or acceptable . it really is el cheapo spiritualism of the most naive kind  and unless that  s your thing  you better do something else with your time and money .  ,0
a documentary about two rocks bands  spanning a number of years . brian jonestown massacre and the dandy warhols . what makes it special is the examination of the complex contrasting personalities and the ironies of success and failure .  br    br   anton newcombe  the main man of brian jonestown massacre  is widely recognised as a musical genius not only by his colleagues  his friends and rivals the dandy warhols  but also by record producers and most people who have worked with him . sadly he and his band members are also incapable of integrating with the real world . newcombe picks fights with band members on stage or with members of the audience  getting arrested at one point for literally kicking in the head of a fan  . newcombe knows no limits  he plays between   and    different instruments  writes and produces all bjm  s music  can produce enough songs to fill a whole album in a single day  has a prophet  like obsessiveness with his own musical genius  but is also a heavy drugs user  flies into rages at the slightest compromise of his own artistic integrity  orders his band members about as if they are lower forms of life  and can blow deals as fast as he makes them . bjm go through a large number of record labels in fast succession  they sign them up as soon as they realise newcombe  s talents and let them go as soon as they realise he is totally uncontrollable .  br    br   the warhols acknowledge their debt to newcombe  s creativity and don  t even put themselves in the same exalted sphere of greatness  but the warhols have something that bjm don  t  the ability to integrate their talents with common sense  the real world  and their market  as a mixing pot of talent  even if much of it is distilled from guru newcombe  and accessibility  they are the very definition of  cool .  dig  follows the parallel careers of the two bands with increasing poignancy . at one point  newcombe pulls stunts designed to generate publicity by sending apparent death threats and hate messages to the warhols  in a box containing live ammunition and insults like a bar of soap  to clean up their act    only he forgets to tell them it  s a stunt and they get so paranoid they take out a restraining order against newcombe . by the time the dandy warhols take off in europe with hits like  every day should be a holiday  and  bohemian like you   newcombe is becoming increasingly isolated . bjm are stopped and the band breaks up when they are arrested for possession of marijuana  the warhols get busted for drugs around the same time  let off with a warning  and even allowed to keep the grass .  br    br   the wider appeal of dig  is that the lessons of genius versus accessibility go way beyond two bands or even rock music . the downside is that it is still a documentary  however intimate  and it will mostly only appeal to dedicated film fans or people who are already interested in the music of one or both of the featured bands . newcombe may well be a largely unrecognised genius  and there are feint glimpses of this in the film  but to the unattuned ear there is little more than the assertions of the people interviewed to attest to this . in the words of one of the band members  in every spiritual tradition  you burn in hell for pretending to be god and not being able to back it up .  newcombe isn  t pretending  but numerically there are maybe still insufficient people to appreciate him in his own lifetime  and dig  has an uphill struggle to rectify the balance in favour of a tortured but largely unrecognised genius .  ,1
this film tried to be too many things all at once stinging political satire  hollywood blockbuster  sappy romantic comedy  family values promo . . . the list goes on and on . it failed miserably at all of them  but there was enough interest to keep me from turning it off until the end .  br    br   although i appreciate the spirit behind war  inc .  it depresses me to see such a clumsy effort  especially when it will be taken by its targets to reflect the lack of the existence of a serious critique  rather than simply the poor writing  direction  and production of this particular film .  br    br   there is a critique to be made about the corporatization of war . but poking fun at it in this way diminishes the true atrocity of what is happening . reminds me a bit of three kings  which similarly trivializes a genuine cause for concern .  ,0
possible spoilers this movie  s reputation precedes it  so it was with anticipation that i sat down to watch it in letterbox on tcm . what a major disappointment .  br    br   the cast is superb and the production values are first  rate  but the characters are without depth  the plot is thin  and the whole thing goes on too long . for a movie that deals with alcoholism  family divisions  unfaithfulness  gambling  and sexual repression  the movie is curiously flat  prosaic  lifeless  and cliche  ridden . one example is the portrayal of frank hirsch  s unfaithfuness his rather heavy  handed request to his wife to  go upstairs and relax a bit  followed by her predictable pleading of a headache  leads  even more predictably  to his evening liaison with his secretary   hey nancy  i  ve got the blues tonight . let  s go for a drive    all according to well  worn formula . we don  t feel these are real people  but cardboard cutouts acting in a marionette play . also  the source of the obvious friction between frank and dave hirsch is never really explored or explained . dave  s infatuation with the on  again  off  again gwen is inexplicable in light of her fatuous inability to defecate or get off the pot . his subsequent marriage of desperation to the shirley maclaine  ginny character is  from the moment of its being presented to this viewer  anyway  obviously doomed to fail  and it was clear  by the conventions of this type of soap opera  that it could only be resolved by someone being killed . the moment the jealous lover started running around with the gun i started a bet with myself as to who  dave or ginny  would get killed . the whole thing was phony with a capital  p  .  br    br   having said that  maclaine  s performance and that of dean martin are the standouts here . but on the whole i find the movie  s interest to be purely that of a period piece of hollywood history .  ,0
avoid the usa version . it is with added us footage and the worst dubbing you  ve ever heard probably done by new york amateurs . the dubbing is so bad that it sounds like mystery science theater     . i think a black guy from the bronx does chiba  s voice . i couldn  t watch the entire film it was that bad . instead of this americanized version watch chiba  s other greats like the streetfighter or karate warriors .  ,0
this is one of the greatest movies ever maybe even the greatest movie ever . i had forgotten about the movie for about   years . until i saw an add on tv for adgth and it brought back fond memories of me watching it when i was a little kid . and when i watched it a few nights ago i became addicted to the movie . usually i don  t like animated family movies but this one is special it is the perfect family movie .  br    br   the ending of the movie always touches my heart and saddens me very much but that is what makes this movie amazing better than all of the garbage that is coming out for kid movies today . i mean the movie is g rated and it is about  dogs who are involved with gambling  there is a lot of smoking  drinking  murder  death and hell depicted in the movie . which i believe makes the movie from good to great . i mean movies today don  t bring reality to kids and in this movie they did .  br    br   rip judith barsi  dom deluise  ,1
oh  come on people give this film a break . the one thing i liked about it was . . . . . . . . . sorry  still thinking . oh yeah     when john wayne came and shot up the the bad guys . oh  sorry  wrong movie  i was thinking of a better quality film . let me see now  i  m still trying to defend it . oh yeah  the chick that was from clueless was in it . don  t put down stacy dash . i mean  we all make mistakes . but boy  stacy  you made a dooooosie .  br    br   hey  one thing that has never been done in a western  even an all female cast  they actually hung a woman from the gallows . that might be a western first . even though her neck should have been broken and she survived the ordeal  still  you  ve got to give the director some effort for trying a western first . also  i  ve never seen a woman lynched from a horse in any western  although that didn  t happen in this movie  i just thought i would give the director another idea for gang of roses   which should be made right after ed wood  s bride of the monster   . maybe that was what the makers of this film were going for . orginality  especially with an all african woman cast and an oriental cowgirl .  br    br   heeey  if the makers of gang of roses want to make a sequel to this mess  you could have such slang like   hey  don  t you be takin about my homegirls  and  talk to the hand  baby  talk to the hand .  you could also have a surfer dude type deputy marshal that says things like   that gunfight was totally rad man  totally .  you know things like that .  ,0
the original  vanishing point  was a great flick . subtle motives  characters that seemed real and spontaneous . the remake was terrible . preachy  overtly obvious it missed the point as to why the original was a classic . the black charger was cool  but even that couldn  t rescue this flick . why stick with a white challenger  i didn  t think that was the best choice back in    . some parts of the film were unintentionally hilarious . like when vigo was standing on a cliff overlooking the canyon after his  dream quest  . his indian pal was standing next to him . vigo was only wearing his white briefs . i  m sorry  it just looked silly  him surveying the vista in his fruit of the looms . another scene was at the end  after the explosive crash into the bulldosers  the announcer said that the impact was clocked at    mph . then he mentions that the cops said his remains weren  t found because he vaporized  but some people believe he bailed out and was hidden by friends in the crowd . then it shows him rolling out of the car at    mph  first of all  you couldn  t open the car door at    mph . secondly  the car would not continue to travel in a straight line for    yds . with nobody to steer it . it would promptly roll over about   times . thirdly  if you hit the pavement at    mph  you would wind up in various squishy pieces . no matter  we see him at the end standing with his daughter . all in all  a movie that would insult anyone  s intelligence .  ,0
  the sweet is never as sweet without the sour .  this quote was essentially the theme for the movie in my opinion . tom cruise plays a young man who was handed everything in his life . he takes things for granted and it comes around full swing in this great movie with a superb twist . this film will keep you engaged in the plot and unable to pause it to take a bathroom break .  br    br   its a movie that really makes you step back and look at your life and how you live it . you cannot really appreciate the better things in life  the sweet   like love  until you have experienced the bad  the sour  . the theme will really get you to  open your eyes  .  br    br   only complaint is that the movie gets very twisted at points and is hard to really understand . i think the end is perfect though . i recommend you watch it and see for yourself .  ,1
magellan   said  you can only do so much when the two stars of the show can only be seen by one fellow cast member .   br    br   i assume  then  that you never heard of  topper  .  br    br   which  in addition to the two stars who could only be seen by one member of the cast  had a dog  ditto .  br    br   this was the kind of program that had  not gonna make it  written allover it from the first episode  it was like an arcade video game where you actually have to read the instructions to play no  one  well  very few of us  apparently  wants to watch a comedy program that has a basic premise that actually requires thought to grasp .  ,1
wow  here it finally is the action  movie  without action . in a real low  budget setting  don  t miss the hilarious flying saucers flying by a few times  of a future seattle we find a no  brain hardbody seeking to avenge her childhood .  br    br   there is nothing even remotely original or interesting about the plot and the actors  performance is only rivalled in stupidity by the attempts to steal from other movies  mainly  matrix  without having the money to do it right . yes  we do get to see some running on walls and slow motion shoot  outs    secs approx .  but these scenes are about as cool as the stupid hardbody  s attempts at making jokes about male incompetence now and then .  br    br   and  yes  we are also served a number of leads that lead absolutely nowhere  as if the script was thought  out by the previously unseen cast while shooting the scenes .  br    br   believe me  it is as bad as it possibly can get . in fact  it doesn  t deserve to be taken seriously  but perhaps i can make some of you not rent it and save your money .  ,0
amateurism best describes the film adaptation of the best  selling philosophical novel  the celestine prophecy   which follows the spiritual awakening of an out of work teacher in a mysterious village in peru . home video quality actors present so  called characters spewing overwrought exposition and metaphysical hokum  while the film is propelled by the extremely heavy  handed direction of armand mastroianni . even though there are visible attempts at measuring up to and interesting fans of stronger fare in the vain of abc  s  lost  or dan brown  s  the da vinci code   the filmmakers are hardly up to the task . this film reeks of ill  conceived mass consumption spiritual propaganda  and the results are so awful few can wade through this mess to spot a real point .  ,0
it is difficult to find any positives in this movie . seems as though the producer needed to make a buck without much effort  hence we are treated to a full showing of galaxy which is the lamest excuse for a movie in history . the police girls looked extremely sexy in their little uniforms . more action shots of the two cops  a lot less of galaxy would have been the way to go . of course that would add to the budget so they decided to fill the space with that wretched rerun . ms albright does excellent looking sexy  her acting is first rate . ms stabs whom i had heard of but not seen on screen before also looked very desirable but seems to lack basic acting talent . apart from ms albright this is real garbage .  ,0
i have never known of a film to arouse such debate in my life . believe me when i say that this film will eventually be remembered as an all  time classic . i was waiting in anticipation for this film as i had previously loved both lock  stock . . . . and snatch  but after some of the negative reviews i thought i would be very disappointed . i absolutely loved this film and i can  t wait to see it again . this film is totally different to both of the aforementioned ritchie films  and also a lot better . i have my pick of favourite directors but none of them have pulled off a move as great as guy ritchie has just done with this movie . i believe he has taken movie  making to another level  i know most people will be laughing at this comment guaging the reaction to this film  but i believe time will prove me right  . this movie is very confusing and carried on for much longer than the  hr or so running time as i couldn  t stop thinking about it or trying to piece things together . i have now got a pretty good take on everything that happens in this film  some answers from endless hours of thinking  some answers from reading other people  s take on the film  and now cannot wait until sunday when i will see it again . i just hope people go to the cinema with an open mind and they will hopefully be rewarded as i and many others have been .  ,1
this movie is awesome . i watched it the other day with my cousin jay  jay . he said it was alright  but i think it rulezzz  i mean  it  s so cool . ted v . mikels is so brave and smart . he made a movie totally unlike those terrible hollywood films  like the matrix and stop or my mom will shoot . it could have been better  though . i like ninjas and pirates . i also like that big talon that the funny man wears . i think he  s the coolest guy since that domino pizza claymation guy . not only does this movie look really cool  like those out  of  focus movies my dad made of my birthday when i turned  . but it tells a complex tale with dozens of characters that seem to be totally unrelated  but they all meet up in the end . it  s genius how this web is woven to make everything meet up . i wish ted v . mikels would make a sequel . but it needs more aliens . and a pirate .  ,0

this film was just brilliant  casting  location scenery  story  direction  everyone  s really suited the part they played  and you could just imagine being there  robert redford  s is an amazing actor and now the same being director  norman  s father came from the same scottish island as myself  so i loved the fact there was a real connection with this film  the witty remarks throughout the film were great  it was just brilliant  so much that i bought the film as soon as it was released for retail and would recommend it to everyone to watch  and the fly  fishing was amazing  really cried at the end it was so sad  and you know what they say if you cry at a film it must have been good  and this definitely was  also congratulations to the two little boy  s that played the part  s of norman and paul they were just brilliant  children are often left out of the praising list i think  because the stars that play them all grown up are such a big profile for the whole film  but these children are amazing and should be praised for what they have done  don  t you think  the whole story was so lovely because it was true and was someone  s life after all that was shared with us all .  ,1
i really felt cheated after seeing this picture . it felt like i sat watching this movie    minutes for nothing . i don  t understand what they were thinking when they made this . it hardly gets into jeffrey dahmer murdering and it has no ending . it felt almost like they were leaving this movie open for a sequel . it was like watching a television episode of the sopranos . it ends suddenly  and you know there  s going to be another episode next week . it also felt like i just watched part  to a two part movie . there are many possibilities for what went wrong here they got lazy  they ran out of money  they didn  t know the rest of the story  they wanted to make a dahmer  . after seeing this movie they all sound very accurate . i was watching jeffrey dahmer walking through the woods . all of a sudden i hear this music playing  then writing comes on the screen and says how dahmer served  years of his sentence and was attacked by a fellow inmate and killed at the age of   . wow  he goes from a walk in the woods to his death in jail . how about showing how he got there . how about showing dahmer  s trial . how about showing some more detail . i can  t even explain what happened in this movie because it jumped all over the place . i actually found myself saying in disbelief   that  s it  that  s the end   i want to conclude this review by saying there is still a good dahmer movie yet to be made . to the filmmakers i  d like to say  if you  re going to do it  do it right .  ,0
williamson  s accent is tough to wade through . he speaks incredibly quickly  like he is in a rush to get through the lines . during the soliloquies he acts as if he is talking to someone  when he is supposed to be talking to himself . all that and his bald spot just annoyed me . he was just too old for this role . in reading other accounts of williamson  maybe he got this role because he was mad and the director decided to do a bit of life  imitates  art or forced method acting . when the actors declare hamlet mad you believe it  marianne faithful is a stunning beauty and could botch the role of ophelia and still get a pass . the set is dark and foreboding but it does look as if shot in a real castle especially the scenes in the tunnels  corridors where the dead king shines as a great light in the sky .  ,0

time paradoxes are the devil  s snare for underemployed minds . they  re fun to consider in a  what if   sort of way . film makers and authors have dealt with this time and again in a host of films and television including  star trek first contact   the  back to the future  trilogy   bill and ted  s excellent adventure    groundhog day  and the stargate sg  homage   window of opportunity  . heinlein  s  all you zombies  was written decades ago and yet it will still spin out people reading that short story for the first time .  br    br   in the case of terry gilliam  s excellent film     monkeys   it  s hard to establish what may be continuity problems versus plot elements intended to make us re  think our conception of the film . repeated viewings will drive us to different conclusions if we retain an open mind .  br    br   some  seeing the film for the first time  will regard cole  played by bruce willis  as a schizophrenic . most will see cole as a man disturbed by what adams describes as  the continual wrenching of experience  visited upon him by time travel .  br    br   unlike other time travel stories     monkeys  is unclear as to whether future history can be changed by manipulating events in the past . cole tells his psychiatrist  railly  madeleine stowe   that time cannot be changed  but a phone call he makes from the airport is intercepted by scientists after he has been sent back to      in his own personal time  line .  br    br   even this could be construed as an event that had to happen in a single time  line universe  in order to ensure that the time  line is not altered . . . cole has to die before the eyes of his younger self for fate to be realised . if that  s the case  time is like a fluid  it always finds its own level or path  irrespective of the external forces working on it . it boggles the mind to dwell on this sort of thing too much .  br    br   if you can change future events that then guide the actions of those with the power to send people back in time  as we see on board the plane at the end of the film  then that means the future can be changed by manipulating past events . . . or does it  the film has probably led to plenty of drunken brawls at bars frequented by physicists and mathematicians .  br    br   bonus material on the dvd makes for very interesting viewing . gilliam was under more than normal pressure to bring the film in under budget  which is no particular surprise after the  munchausen  debacle and in light of his later attempt to film  don quixote  . i would rate the  making of  documentary as one of the more interesting i  ve seen . it certainly is no whitewash and accurately observes the difficulties and occasional conflict arising between the creative people involved . gilliam  s description of the film as his   th  release  on account of the film being written by writers other than himself  and therefore  not really  his  film   doesn  t do the film itself justice .  br    br   brad pitt  s portrayal of goines is curiously engaging  although his character is not especially sympathetic . watch for his slightly wall  eyed look in one of the scenes from the asylum . it  s disturbing and distracting .  br    br   probably a coincidence  the louis armstrong song  what a wonderful world  was used at the end of both    monkeys  and the final episode of the tv series of  the hitchhiker  s guide to the galaxy  . both the film and the tv series also featured british actor simon jones .  br    br      monkeys  is a science fiction story that will entertain in the same way that the mental stimulation of a game of chess may entertain . it  s not a mindless recreation  that  s for sure .  ,1
being that this movie has a lot of fine entertainment qualities i think it should some more credit than it has been given on imdb .  br    br   it  s your basic  who done it   thriller with sex and murder but it keeps you guessing right to the end . i like these kinds of movies and i certainly think this one meets the standard .  br    br   to me it was worth watching more than once so i  ll give it an  on imdb .  ,1
the fiendish plot of dr . fu manchu starring peter sellers in a spoof of the characters created by sax rohmer is an injustice to the end of sellers  career . the plot was very simplistic  and if done the right way could have been handled nicely  but instead it was poorly executed . part of the reasons why this film wasn  t that good was the poor dialog  cheap laughs  choppy directing  and an awkward feeling that the film was somewhat incomplete .  br    br   the acting  on the other hand  was really the only thing that kept my interest during this mixed up picture . i found sellers portrayal of diabolical manchu brilliantly done  with the occasional lines that will be remembered . for example  there is the scene where fu manchu is confused which henchman is which in which he says  ah  you all look the same to me .  i hate to admit it  but i laughed out loud with that line .  br    br   then of course a fistful of strong supporting characters really caught my attention with the likes of helen mirren as the backstabbing constable  david tomilson as sir roger avery  his last film as well  not a way to end a career   and sid ceasar  who gives a rather whimsical performance of al capone  s relative who works for the fbi  . these characters also kept me watching .  br    br   the sets were also nice . oriental designs and english society in     was depicted with elegance in this dud  of  a  picture .  br    br   in all honesty  my advice to you is to watch the film if you are a peter sellers or sid ceasar fan . otherwise  you  re better off settling on chewing aluminum foil .  ,0
dull  predictable and uninteresting story of a man contaminated by a chemical substance  weller  who goes on across the country just to find his ex  wife and children meanwhile  he kills everyone in his way only by a single touch of his hands . in his dangerous track  a doctor  hurt  and a young reporter  natasha  try to stop the man . the movie has a not original premise but even though could be much better . the final result is just a movie without suspense or gritting moments . even the good cast is completely waste . i give this a   four  .  ,0
ladislas starewicz  s curiosity with insects and cinema melds into a short film about a love triangle between mr . beetle  an artistic grasshopper  and mrs . beetle . the rather simple story of an adulterous beetle couple that both seek stimulation outside their marriage is similar to a biograph or vitagraph short of the time . starewicz  s twist on the story is to use embalmed beetles with wires straightening the legs in frame  by  frame animation . the story builds as mr . beetle is unknowingly caught on camera with a dragonfly from the local nightclub by a jealous grasshopper . when mr . beetle comes home to find his wife in the arms of her artistic friend  he chases her around angrily  but eventually forgives her and takes her out to see a movie . however  mrs . beetle soon learns of her husband  s infidelities as the movie they watch is the jealous grasshopper  s footage of mr . beetle and the dragonfly together . mrs . beetle thrashes mr . beetle with her umbrella  mr . beetle jumps through the screen  and they both end up in jail after the projector they wreck catches on fire . the insects are placed in humanized settings such as a house or a nightclub  and are given human characteristics of jealousy  anger  lust  and revenge . the insect characters carry briefcases  drive motorcars  and even wear shoes yet they also twitch their antennae and open and close their mandibles as real insects would . the novelty of the story doesn  t wear itself out  even after multiple viewings  but as fluid as the movements are  the film moves slowly . action happens with intricate detail  but rapidity and a quicker pace of filming is lost in the process . despite its pace  the film is an excellent example of starewicz  s early puppetry and is highly recommended .  ,1

this movie is actually worse than most movies i  ve ever suffered through  and i  ve suffered through a lot . absolute nonsense . it  s got terrible  forced dialogue pointless plot developments really drawn out  spooky imagery  scenes  which look more like a high school remedial art project than a horror movie     at best attractive women long  boring sex scenes involving said women  forget what you know about virgins  especially ones with lop  sided fake breasts   muttered  difficult to understand speech from some of the characters and they actually used the masks from killer klowns from outer space during a masturbation scene  which should be a saving grace because that movie was pretty funny  but it isn  t . veden fell is the lamest bad guy in the history of film .  br    br   absolutely give this one a miss .  ,0
this film caught me off guard when it started out in a cafe located in arizona and a richard grieco   rex    dead easy       decides to have something to eat and gets all hot and bothered over a very hot  sexy waitress . while rex steps out of the cafe  he sees a state trooper and asks him   are you fast   and then all hell breaks loose in more ways than one . nancy allen  maggie hewitt    dressed to kill        is a tv reporter and is always looking for a news scoop to broadcast . maggie winds up in a hot tub and rex comes a calling on her to tell her he wants a show down  western style  with the local top cop in town . this is a different film  however  nancy allen and richard grieco are the only two actors who help this picture together   ,1
i completely disagree with the other comments posted on this movie . for instance  the movie is based on the book and if the writer had a gay character in it then how could  hollywood  just throw in a token gay character in the movie . and besides there was two gay characters and i thought they reflected each other great . one was normal and the other was more feminine but it wasn  t over the top . and diane keaton gave a wonderful performance and if the other reviewer had the decency to actual watch the entire film they would have seen that her character developed through out the film by interacting with the other characters . for instance when she and adam went to look at the car that sara crashed in the junkyard you could see the maternal side of her come out and later in the film you saw that she too was invincible . but i guess if you  re too worried about gay characters and characters that are flawed then this movie is bad . but if you  re more open  minded and i don  t know actually have some inkling of what is good then you  ll enjoy this film .  ,1
 . . . . . . . . . . . as i was when i saw this movie  i will never watch this movie again  not because it is a bad movie  but because it scared me so much  as i said  i was   when my english teacher decided to show it to us the reason for this is that we had read an extract from the book .  br    br   all the girls in my class were terrified when the woman in black comes through the window and floats over kidd  s bed  although  just before that there is something that also frightened us  which was when kidd finds the toy soldier underneath his pillow  and he hears a child  s voice say  it  s for you  . that scene still haunts me to this day  nearly  years after i saw the film .  br    br   if you are easily scared  avoid this film          ,1
again  it seems totally illogical  to me at least  that  arthur  merits a mere  .  out of   possible . steve gordon  s one  shot masterpiece herein is the totally  unlikely  if not quite  impossible  melding of wildly disparate elements . that he managed to make alcoholism laugh  friendly rather than tearjerking tragic is  in itself  wonderful . that he gave dudley moore his finest role  and every other cinematic element herein its optimal impact  including the score  seems to me patent and egregious . i challenge anyone to sit through this film and not laugh out loud . but  apparently  nearly a third of its audience has so managed . well  i  for one  found and find gordon  s effort both laughable and lovable  and the iikes of geraldine fitzgerald  s great  aunt and stephen elliott  s murderous would  be father  in  law absolute gems of background characters . even the black chauffeur managed to escape patronization  and the late  sniffish sir john gielgud was right about accepting his fee  but wrong about undertaking his role .  arthur  makes no effort to  underztand   much less rationalize  the scourge of  alcoholism   hey  ifit ain  t booze  it  s other drugs of choice  including meth  and addictions are merely symptoms  not targets   it simply observes in its own quizzical manner .  ,1

the star of this film is the screenplay . attention to detail for the period in dress  language  social mores  we don  t hurt women  and the politics are remarkable . it is a reminder of kosovo to  day . the subtle pieces in the action scenes are there for an attentive viewer and the choreography of these action sequences is superb . perhaps this film is to close to the bone of reality to earn the support it should have received . it is like a staircase of increasing violence with well paced pauses of peace and serenity between each step . a great film . . . .  ,1
this movie which was released directly on video should carry a warning label that it is dangerous to human health and may subject the viewer to terminal boredom . it is yet another thinly veiled  evangalizing  rapture  religious movie with the good guys  the believers  suddenly vanishing and the bad guys  the non  believers  left behind . it  s an interesting concept  especially since we see it happen on a flight captained by a non  believer who is having a sinful affair with a stewardess aboard  needless to say that sinner doesn  t disappear either   . unhappily  with all the pilots being non  believers  the plane did not crash or the movie would have been mercifully over . though this could have be interesting without the heavy religious browbeating  as a whole the plodding movie makes one gag  the acting is horrible and the obviously computer  generated simulations are very fake looking . plus it  s yet another movie shot in canada that purports to be new york city . spare me . . . i  ll just read the bible .  ,0

i recently saw this at the     palm springs international film . this is the feature length directorial debut of veteran dutch actress monique van de ven and based on my observation it should be her last . i hate movies that are so implausible that you are picking apart practically every scene . this film immediately leaves you scratching your head . as it begins a young photographer and his girlfriend who works for an international aid organization are having a leisurely drive through the taliban  controlled mountains afghanistan having a conversation about their love when a rocket stops a truck in front of them . they get out of their vehicle to watch as talliban fighters equipped with rocket launchers  machine guns  rifles  handguns and grenades execute all five people in the truck . bob  waldemar torenstra  starts taking pictures of all this when he is spotted by one of the insurgents who lobs a hand grenade at them that kills his girlfriend . since they are with hand throwing distance they can  t be more than   yards away yet he somehow gets away . his girlfriend is blown up and he takes a picture of the moment of the grenade impact that kills her and wins a prize as photographer of the year for the photo . every scene and situation in this film as as ridiculous as it  s opening . the following year bob finds himself on assignment for national geographic on a dutch resort island where he meets kathleen  sophie hilbrand  and inserts himself into her seedy underworld of international drug smugglers . avoid this film . i would give it a  .  out of   .  ,0
writer  director tony piccirillo adapted his own play about a straight man  recently widowed  learning in the last three weeks he is hiv  positive he tracks down the one homosexual partner he ever had  brings him to an apartment and ties him up  forcing a blood test on the guy and promising bloody revenge if the results come back positive . intriguing idea sounds better on paper than it plays out . james marsden  s captive is realistically cynical and snotty  but the actor  s own artificial mannerisms are disconcerting   it  s like watching a roadshow version of tom cruise . scott speedman has to work harder with the more challenging role  but his personality  turn from shy guy to kidnapper  on  the  edge isn  t convincing  and neither are the conversations the two men have . marsden  s gay party boy isn  t apathetic  of course   he  s momentarily sympathetic to speedman  s plight   but he doesn  t react or behave the way any homosexual man would in this circumstance . the movie isn  t a cop  out  exactly  but it is a fraud  handicapped further by the bad editing  the poorly  conceived flashbacks  the low  budget production  and the big finale which smacks of silly pretension and soapy melodrama .     from   ,0
  perhaps we can arrange a meet .   where are you now    i  m sitting in my office .   i doubt that .   why would you doubt that    if you were in your office right now we  d be having this conversation face  to  face .   br    br   bourne remains street tough  and elusive . only his inhuman resilience leads the film a little too far into fantasy . conversation is macho  to the point with only shards of bond type gallows humour . its all about the action .  br    br   the feeling that there is something going on at another level to the world we live in is what the trilogy coveys so well . a scene set in waterloo with a guardian journalist does this to great effect . there is no meeting of worlds  you are in it or just a superfluous body .  br    br   if the shaky cam doesn  t annoy you too much  enjoy this film and hope they somehow keep the franchise going .  ,1
this is one of the unusual cases in which a movie and the novel on which it is based are both great . maybe this is because gorris  takes nabokov  s initial ideas and gives them a different interpretation . the final consequence is a point of view over luzhin which dignifies him more than the nabokov  s one .  br    br   the only thing in the movie which i don  t like is the influence of valentinov  s on luzhin  s destiny . i can  t imagine nabokov creating a person like valentinov and giving him so great influence on novel  s argument .  ,1
like ishtar and king of comedy  other great  misunderstood comedies  envy has great performances by two actors playing essentially  losers  may be too harsh a word  i will call them suburban under  achievers  .  br    br   this film was a dark comedy gem  and i  m not sure what people expect . i relish seeing a major studio comedy that isn  t filled with obvious humor  and i believe that the small moments in this movie make it worthwhile . the look on stiller  s face when he sees the dog doo disappear for the first time captures a moment  a moment that most people should be able to recognize in themselves . yes  it was a fairly simple story  but it examined the root of envy in a really interesting way . there were a lot of great scenes  the j  man  s decrepit  cabin by the lake   corky  s unceremonious burial  weitz  s wife role  and walken  s j  man   all great stuff .  br    br   i can  t stand people that get on imdb and mercilessly trash films when they have absolutely no idea what it takes to make one . i will take envy over almost any of the top ten grossing comedies of the year  save napoleon dynamite .  it  s wittier  wackier  and an offbeat  enjoyable gem .  br    br   remember this people most times  popular doesn  t equal good .  ,1
  dressed to kill  is surely one of the best horror  thriller movies ever made . it  s taut  stylish and extremely suspenseful mixture of sex and violence . the acting is pretty good  the orchestral score by pino donaggio is unforgettable and there  s plenty of surprises to keep thriller fans intrigued .  dressed to kill  is a murder mystery that involves a sexually frustrated housewife  angie dickinson   her teenage son  keith gordon   her psychoanalyst  michael caine   and a high price call girl  nancy allen  . the murderer in the film is a transsexual named bobbi who is also one of caine  s patients . the film is full of breathtaking momentsthe infamous elevator murder scene is extremely stylish and pretty gory as well . highly recommended .  ,1
if there was some weird inversed oscar academy awards festival this flick would win it all . it has all the gods  excellent plot  extreme special effects coupled with extremely good acting skills and of course in every role there is a celebrity superstar . well  this could be the scenario if the world was inversed  but it  s not . instead it  s the worst horror flick ever made  not only bad actors that seem to read the scripts from a teleprinter with bad dyslexia  but also extremely low on special effects . for example the devil costume  which by the way is a must  see   is something of the most hilarious i  ve ever seen . whenever i saw that red  black so called monster on screen i couldn  t hold my laugh back . and to top of things it looked like the funny creature was transported by a conveyor  belt .  br    br   do not do the same mistake as i did . checking imdb seeing that the movie was released in      had less than five votes and thinking   well  it  s worth a shot  can  t be that bad  .  br    br   yes it could .  br    br   i  m not even going to waste more words on this movie .  ,0
i went into this movie thinking that it would be a neat football drama  in the same vein as remember the titans   however  i came away feeling like i had just attended a ted haggard sermon about the rapture . the only thing that was missing was the request for a tithe at the end of the movie . actually  one would probably get more out of a televangelist sermon than this poor excuse for entertainment . at least with the televangelist sermon  there are quotes from the scripture rather than quotes from popularist self  help pulp . the plot was entirely too predictable to the point that anyone with a long  enough attention span could have laid out the entire plot within the first   minutes of the movie .  ,0
  br    br   it  s a generic coming  of  age story   think  the member of the wedding    summer of       a summer place   even  little women    and there are moments where mulligan might have omitted the soupy music  not used slow  motion  or played down the golden  lit prettiness of the setting . otherwise  it  s done with rare emotional perfect  pitch . nothing  s forced  every line has feeling  and the pacing is just right . even the below  a  list casting helps bigger movie stars with more recognizable personalities might have overwhelmed the material . in particular  witherspoon is excellent her line readings are fresh and original  and her body language is just right for a gawky  hoydenish    year  old on the eve of womanhood . waterston is also very fine  even if he has to spend much of the movie climbing in and out of the family truck .  br    br   one senses that the film  s makers were aware of its unpromising commercial prospects   no big stars  no big car crashes  no special effects   and consciously decided to make the best possible movie  box office be damned . it  s intimate and honest  and it sticks to the ribs . if you find yourself misting up at the end  you don  t have to feel you  ve been duped .  ,1
want to watch a scary horror film  then steer clear of this one . there  s not enough beer in the world to make this film enjoyable .  br    br   however  there is enough scotch . single  malt  if you can manage it .  br    br   if the previous comments weren  t enough to keep you from watching this film sober  allow me to assist . nasa sends one man and two unpaid extras into space to orbit saturn . a really big solar flare causes colonel steve west to bleed from the nose . things go downhill from there  and wackiness ensues .  br    br   i actually read the book adaptation  which was published and released only in the uk . miles better than the film  and the book was dreadful . at least some pretense is made towards suspense  and some sort of explanation of events is pulled out from the author  s  rhymes with  gas   .  br    br   not to say that the film is completely without merit . rick baker learned that he really ought to read a contract before signing on to a film  and jonathan demme found that he  s really better suited to direct .  br    br   yes  there is an mst  k episode featuring this flick  but it is  of course  edited quite a bit . without the obligatory flashing of the breasts  not even the healing power of scotch can save you .  br    br   please  just go watch raiders of the lost ark if you want to see a guy melt . see space cowboys if you feel the need to see astronauts . i can not  in all good conscience  recommend this film to the sober film  going public .  ,0
shall we dance is an excellent film because it shows how something  like dancing  can rejuvenate the life flow in the human spirit .  br    br   dance is seen as the expression of existence  and the birth of individuality . the is certainly the case with aoki . at work he is a humble office denizen  but place him on the dance floor and all his bottled up intensity is released . surprisingly  this release is frowned upon in japan  due to the rigid culture of conformity . at the start of the film  all the characters are ashamed or frightened of their desire to dance . they will be scorned  or deemed perverted  for expressing their passion through dance .  br    br   this film is well worth watching to witness the rebirth of human emotions and passions . it will leave a smile on your face for days .  ,1
what the movie the   s really represents  to those of us who growled around in the belly of america in those times  is the turbulence and diversity of the decade . despite the exaggerated  stereotyped characters  the genuineness of the issues remains clear .  br    br   not only were those radical times of change  but also very confusing times . two basic things changed our world then the     civil rights act  and the overwhelming influence of the media . those two new freedoms began social changes that soon became institutionalized .  br    br   from chaos came sensitivity  from disorder came values . bear in mind however  that the bulk of americans were not involved in this . . . they worked  they played  they watched the news . . . and slowly they became effected by the efforts and struggles of the minorities . . . the civil rights workers  the political activists  the anti  war efforts  the war on poverty . . . .  br    br   the representation of the power of the press and tv in particular  was well reflected  although the conflict between the general public  s attitude and those seeking to change things was at best ignored . . . and at worst  misrepresented . . middle class americans weren  t all standing around angrily holding baseball bats  or disowning their wayward daughters . they were confused too . let us not forget how folk singers suddenly became protest singers  and how the beatles began an onslaught that killed the folk  protest movement . there are no beatle songs in the movie  or even any mention of them .  br    br   i think if you didn  t live the decade  you might not have a sense of what the movie is about  the overall picture is a bit dim . at one point i held down a steady job while my sister lived at the hog farm commune and went to woodstock . at another point i was in haight asbury and in the detroit riots while she worked and played the housewife in maine and connecticut . roles were constantly changing .  br    br   the movie depicts three siblings of a middle class family . they represent the hippie child  the political activist  and the active military personnel . dad represents the typical attitudes  and mom represents the voice of reason  tolerance  and sometimes compromise . . . for the sake of peace .  br    br   the black family comprises a minister and his son . . . disproportionately  i think . i assume the producers knew all the variables and had to settle on limitations  or else the film would have become a long  boring  documentary . dad  s message was that anger produces bitterness  and bitterness produces chaos . it was clearly a message directed to today  s youth .  br    br   we are looking at a unique solution to social problems  and also how issues divide us . . . the   s were unusual in that way  and only the roaring   s compare . in other words  this movie has a moral after all . in the end  it is our collective individualism that survives . put that in your oxymoron list .  br    br   everyone was a god  a guru  or a free  spirited genius in the   s . it was a time of magic and madness . no one will ever nail the   s down right . . . it was too diverse  this movie is close  . at least we can say we are not ashamed of it  that we learned and grew from it  and that for once  a generation shaped and changed america . . . for the better .  ,1
this movie really has no beginning or end . and it  s really very unbelievable . mary  k and ashley are supposed to be interns working in a mailing room for an italian fashion company . but  for some reason  they  re put up in a   star hotel  conveniently located across the street from the coliseum   and all of the other interns they work with are just as abnormally model  looking as they are . one thing that i found obvious in this movie is the way that one of the twins doesn  t end up with the guy . i guess they tried to twist their usual plot a bit . nice try .  ,0
the zenith of two brilliant careers . david lynch  better known for less accessible material  crafts a delicate and exquisite story around the most unlikely premise . a man travels to see his estranged brother . having no other means of transportation  his journey takes him over six weeks on a lawn mower . richard farnsworth  in his last film  delivers a stunningly layered and nuanced performance in the starring role . achingly beautiful in its exultation of small things  straight story is a classic cinema experience that must not be missed . sissy spacek is notable as farnsworth  s daughter  an impaired middle  aged woman living with the loss of her children .  ,1
i can watch a good gory film now and then . i  ve seen some pretty sick stuff . however  this is one of the few films that i found to be grotesque in a way that was just plain repulsive and revolting . i like gore films when they are fun . i like wen they are a lot of creativity behind them . the gore in this film is not creative . it is sick . it is repugnant . it is completely unpleasant . because of this  this film is certainly not entertaining . the film is a horror film  but it lacks scares . so pretty much the only reason why one would watch this film is for the gore  but that is the most unappealing and ugly aspect of the whole film  and that  s saying a lot . the acting is terrible  the plot makes no sense  and the music is really annoying and way too electronic sounding . it all took me right out of the film . pretty much the whole film is one big long depressing ordeal . there  s this guy that has a freak accident in a shuttle and awakens in a hospital to find that his skin is dissolving and melting off . i guess that after that he goes out and eats human flesh in order to slow down the melting process . there  s some weird subplot involving an old couple getting chased by a dog  some dismembered head floating down a stream  and an ending involving a man being electrocuted . there were times where i tried really hard to enjoy it  but the only scene in the whole film that i thought was even entertaining was the scene early on in which a nurse runs down a hospital corridor in slow motion . if you like ugly  nasty  ad unappealing horror films  this one is for you .  ,0

i don  t give a movie or a show ten very often but this show touched a nerve in a way no other show has . i found the entire series on mysoju . com and thought the premise looked interesting so i took a look see . i wasn  t disappointed in what i saw i was moved . this story stays on the tender side as the main characters move us through the scenes . sumire iwaya  played thoughtfully by koyuki  shows us human nature as she wants to keep troubles from being shown . no one really wants to lay their soul out in front of a perspective mate . so instead she substitutes a human  played by an adorable matsumoto jun  as a pet . this pet is like any other creature we would consider a pet . the difference he can retaliate in the same way  after all momo is a man  not a dog . as he is treated like a pet  he reacts to situations how a dog might react . she spends time with the new boyfriend  momo gets jealous . it  s when she realizes that her pet isn  t just a pet that the sexual tension between the two starts to become thick  momo is a dance prodigy . her thinking slowly changes as we start to get a glance at his own thoughts . matsumoto takes us from seeing a character who is very one dimensional in the beginning  to two dimensional when we see he  s a dancer  to a three dimensional character when we see him start to fall for his master as a man  not as a dog . in my opinion  it  s worth watching this story just to see this character develop . plus matsumoto plays momo with such tenderness you almost start to wish you had one too . neither wants to think about the future and how their relationship will change  but as momo  the name she gives him as one would name their new puppy  states  we both knew this wasn  t going to be able to last . watch this show with a open mind  it  s worth it .  ,1

a childless couple  brooke adams  jeff hayenga  go to a doctor  james karen  to try to conceive . it works but adams slowly becomes aware that there  s something seriously wrong with the baby . . .  br    br   pretty interesting idea is thoroughly done in by a lousy script   the basic idea is ok but becomes screamingly predictable towards the end . i saw every  twist  coming . the direction is poor   he seems to have no idea how to shoot a basic scene . the production values are   to be nice   lousy . very shabby . and  the gore scenes are too unpleasant  i almost turned it off when a pregnant woman started stabbing herself in the stomach  with lousy special effects . the film completely derails at the end when it becomes quite clear they had no idea how to end this film .  br    br   some good acting makes it somewhat bearable . adams  hayenga and karen are all good at their roles and kept me watching but that was about it . this film barely got released in     and still remains unknown   it  s easy to see why . i give it a  .  ,0
this film is shoddily  made  unoriginal garbage . i like romantic comedies sometimes . watching a good one is like eating ice cream for dinner . it  s not something you are going to do all the time  but the experience is so pleasurable that you can ignore how unwise you are being . this movie made me think about how stupid i was for continuing to remain seated for its entire running time . everything about it screamed made on the cheap . it actually looks like they overexposed the film at certain points it is so washed out . it boasts cheesy cgi and lame sets  too .  br    br   the writing was clunky . i know that you can usually expect some plot problems in a screwball comedy  but you usually don  t really care because you are laughing . this movie is so unfunny that you actually sit there and wonder about the unlikely series of coincidences and completely unbelievable behavior involved . events were placed in the film just to move the characters from one scene to the next or to provide exposition . sure  this is how all movies work  but you shouldn  t notice that it  s happening . inelegant . that  s the term i should use .  br    br   there was almost no one in the movie who was really likable . i didn  t care who ended up with whom  as long as they all stayed the hell away from me  and i didn  t have to listen to them talk about it anymore . why would the only really cool character in the movie  the paul rudd character  want to have anything to do with the completely bitchy  condescending  control freak played by eva longoria  also  almost all of the characters involved consistently picked the sleaziest solution to any situation . a straight man pretends to be gay for five years just to hang out  and bathe with  with a woman he is attracted to  the best feel  good moment they could come up with was to tack on a happy ending for the same schmoe where he gets together with rudd  s equally annoying lying  kleptomaniac sister  lake bell and eva longoria are very attractive  appealing women . maybe they will find something better to appear in down the road .  ,0
the first episode immediately gave a good impression what to expect from the series  mysteries waiting to be solved and a lot of good drama  i love the fact that they gradually reveal the stories concerning the characters  explaining just enough to stay excited  of course this show has some flaws  in the first two series there are some characters who for some reason don  t show up in the third season  many of the characters have a decent sent off but some of them just aren  t there  like rose and her husband  where the hell are they  what happened to them  maybe they will return in later episodes  but it is a little inconsistent  that being said  lost  manages to be thrilling every episode  especially the first two seasons   that is a very hard thing to do  i do notice that in the third season the focus is more on character development than the mystery aspects of the show  this is not a bad thing  it even saves some episodes from getting boring  one of the elements that can be considered the strength of this show are the wonderful characters  you will grow to love these characters  good or bad  but eventually i will want to see some mysteries to be solved and get closure  the danger of  lost  getting canceled due to declining ratings is near  and that would be devastating   ,1

down to earth is about lance barton  a black comedian who gets hit by a truck . he goes to heaven and he gets to get another body . lance gets the body of charles wellington  a white guy . so lance does a few things in the body of charles . the movie has a few laughs  but it  s nothing special . it  s a good movie if you  re a fan of chris rock . madagascar  the     animated comedy  is better . this is a good movie  but chris rock has done way better things than this . it will only make you laugh about  times the whole movie . and it  s not really laugh  out  loud funny . you  ll laugh to yourself and you might giggle  but you definitely won  t be rolling on the floor laughing .  ,0
first off  to give you some idea of my taste in movies . . .  br    br       comedies i enjoyed superbad  knocked up  hot fuzz  blades of glory  br    br       comedies i hated evan almighty  the brothers solomon  good luck chuck  br    br   i should have followed my first instinct and turned off  hot rod  after i got to about the   minute mark . i knew by that point that this movie would not make me laugh once . the script is absolutely brutal  i have no idea how this monstrosity managed to crack  on imdb . any one older than   years old who enjoyed this must be some kind of mental defective .  br    br   this doesn  t come close to anything with will farrell and it  s clear that andy samberg can  t carry anything longer than a  to   minute sketch on youtube or snl . i don  t know how they roped ian mcshane and isla fisher into doing this movie . . . they must have owed favors or something . i came in knowing that it would be a dumb movie  but i thought it would at least be funny . i didn  t so much as smirk .  br    br   i don  t normally comment on movies at imdb  but this was so awful  i just had to warn people . this is only the  th movie i  ve seen that i  ve felt compelled to rate     .  ,0
this movie was  as homer simpson would have put it   more boring than church .  maybe i don  t understand it well enough  and i thought it started out pretty well  but after  start of spoiler  hermann braun is sent to jail and maria starts working  sleeping with her boss it just started to drag  and i struggled to keep awake . again  maybe it symbolizes something  but the explosion at the end seemed very forced and out of place .  end of spoiler  . in the end  i fail to see why others think it  s so great  as i found it extremely boring . by the way  i did not watch this movie by my own free will  as i was required to see it for a film class .  ,0
pegg has had a few hits in the past few years  starting with  shaun of the dead  in      movie on to  hot fuzz       early     he came out with  run fat boy run  and now comes this   how to lose friends and alienate people  which is in many ways one of my favourite comedy  s of the year .  br    br   the film is about sidney yound  a man who writes a failing magazine who makes fun of celebrity  s mostly because he is not one of them . anyway  one of the most successful magazine owners  played by jeff bridges  invites him  out of nostalgia  to work at his magazine . sidney is of course excited and moves to america  there he meets a girl currently writing a book  and hilarity ensues .  br    br   this film is great and i hope more come out like it in the near future . pegg has once again given people everywhere another good film and i cant wait to the see the third part of the blood and ice cream trilogy  paul  . i rate this film    .  ,1
this is not a very good movie  but it  s not a stinker either . it is very confusing and unnecessarily long so rent it at your own risk .  br    br   my gf and i have figured this movie out  we think  so here it is  br    br   major spoilers below  br    br   firstly  this movie is actually quite simple after you remove all of the confusing unconscious  dream  state junk     of the movie .   br    br   ignoring the junk  what really happened is this a group of school friends go to a rave one night . they leave and get into a car accident where everyone but cassie and sean die . that  s the simple cut down version .  that  s right  i said sean  bear with me   br    br   right after the accident  cassie lays in the hospital stuck in between life  death right up until the very end of the movie . this is where the dream part starts .  br    br   the movie is called soul survivors  right  cassie  s mind and soul carries on after the accident interacting with the other souls  annie  matt  raven  the  weirdos and jude  along with images conjured up by her mind  sean  school and everything else around her  . the souls continue doing what they were defined as annie the rave  going chick  the  weirdo  killers  from opening scene   father jude still helping people etc .  br    br   we are then taken on a very long ride  shown lots of images  many of which my gf and i still can  t tie in  but it all boils down to it not being cassie  s time to die .  br    br   at the end  cassie wakes up in the hospital after being  dead  for a while . her family and sean are there . this is reality again . she  s ok .  br    br   then the director adds a little extra spice by trying to confuse us again by showing a little dream snippet of her in the wheelchair being strangled . but this part is really just a nightmare  and she wakes up beside sean  obviously still dealing with her traumatic experience .  br    br   due to space restrictions  we didn  t cover every little thing  but feel free to drop us an e  mail if you want to .  br    br    ,0
zero day is based of columbine high school massacre . and its a video diary of two boys . at first you don  t know whats going to happen you think it is just a bad student film . until they start talking about the horrible things they are going to do in this quite school . until they start talking about pipe bombs and guns and going shooting in the woods . they is a lot to say about this movie . all know this film is well a film you forget you watching a film and watching a real video two boys made .  br    br   the two boys act like they are in a weird cult . they burn all there stuff . like play station games books dvds homework stuff school stuff . these two boys can be anybody your friends you brothers or the people you see walking down the street . it goes through there daily actives  and that is making a gun . in the videos they make it mentions the bullying that happens to them and how people said stuff about there clothes and the things you are into i  m not saying its right but many people do do things like that .  br    br   and also the thing is with this people are suspected to like it because of the sensitive topic they have chosen on this film .  br    br   so thats my review on zero day .  br    br   and lets just say the end shooting scene is messed up .  ,1
as a movie critic for several dutch websites  i have to see lot  s of movies  and not all very good ones . some movies are so bad  you won  t be surprised that they are released straight on video . with taboo  im surprised that it is released on video at all . this is really low budget bad quality bad written rubbish .  br    br   a group of youngsters plays a game of taboo . they write down their most sickening wish or act  and later on people are murdered for their taboo  s . the question is  should we believe what we see   br    br   the movie has a potential interesting plot  twist  and i won  t give it away here . but what could have been interesting stays stupid  bad acted and without any reason .  br    br   some of the actors have played in bigger titles before  so why on earth did they sign up for this  if you see this anywhere  try to dodge it . there is no logic  no human sense of quality in this movie .  ,0
get this film if at all possible . you will find a really good performance by barbara bach  beautiful cinematography of a stately  and incredibly clean  but creepy old house  and an unexpected virtuoso performance by   the unseen  . i picked up a used copy of this film because i was interested in seeing more of bach  whom i  d just viewed in  the spy who loved me .  i love really classically beautiful actresses and appreciate them even more if they can act a little . so we start with a nice fresh premise . tv reporter bach walks out on boyfriend and goes to cover a festival in a california town  solvang  that celebrates its swedish ancestry by putting on a big folk festival . she brings along a camerawoman  who happens to be her sister  and another associate .  the late karen lamm plays bach  s sister  and if you know who the celebrities are that each of these ladies is married to  it is just too funny watching bach  mrs . ringo starr  and lamm  mrs . dennis wilson  going down the street having a sisterly quarrel .   anyway  bach  s disgruntled beau follows her to solvang  as he  s not done arguing with her . there  s a lot of feeling still between them but she doesn  t wanna watch him tear himself up anymore about his down  the  drain football career . the ladies arrive in solvang to do the assignment for their station  only to find their reservations were given away to someone else .  maybe to bach  s boyfriend  because think of it  where  s he gonna stay   . the gals ask around but there is just nowhere to go . mistakenly trying to get into an old hotel which now serves only as a museum  they catch the interest of proprietor mr . keller  the late sidney lassick   who decides to be a gentleman and lodge them at his home  insisting his wife will be happy to receive them . oh no  next thing we know keller is making a whispered phone call to his wife  warning her that company  s coming and threatening that she  d better play along . trouble in paradise  the ladies are eager to settle in and get back to solvang to shoot footage and interview swedes  but one of the girls doesn  t feel good . bach and lamm leave her behind  wondering to themselves about mrs . keller  played heartbreakingly by pretty lelia goldoni  who looks like she just lost her best pal . speaking of which  under  the  weather vicki slips off her clothes and gets into a nice hot tub  not realizing that keller has crept into her room to inspect the keyhole . she hears him  thinks he  s come to deliver linen  and calls out her thanks . lassick did a great job in this scene expressing the anguish of a fat old peeping tom who didn  t get a long enough look . after he  s left  poor vicki tumbles into bed for a nap but gets yanked out of it real fast  in a really decent  frightening round of action  by something big that has apparently crept up through a grille on the floor  the unseen  lamm comes home next  bach is out finishing an argument with her beau  and can  t find anyone in the house . she knocks over a plate of fruit in the kitchen  and  on hands and knees to collect it  her hair and fashionable scarf sway temptingly over the black floor grille  attracting the unseen again  well  at about the time poor lamm is getting her quietus in the kitchen  we do a flashback into mr . keller  s past and get the full story of what his sick  sadistic background really is and why his wife doesn  t smile much . bach finally gets home and wants to know where her friends are . meanwhile  lassick has been apprised of the afternoon  s carnage by his weeping wife and decides he can  t let bach off the premises to reveal the secret of his home . he tempts her down into the basement where the last act of the keller family tragedy finally opens to all of us .  br    br   i cannot say enough for stephen furst  whom i  d never seen before it  s obvious that he did his homework for this role  studying the methods of communication and expression of the brain damaged bach and goldoni  each in their diverse way  just give the movie luster . not only that  but movie winds up with a satisfying resolution . no stupid cheap tricks  eyeball  rolling dialog or pathetically cut corners . . . a real treat for your collection .  ,1

i really do not know what people have against this film  but it  s definitely one of my favourites . it  s not preachy  it  s not anchored by it  s moral  it shouldn  t be controversial . it  s just god . any possible god  no matter the religion . and it  s really funny .  br    br   jim carry plays bruce nolan  a tv reporter usually stuck on the lighter side of the news  desperate to prove himself  more or less to himself  that he can be taken seriously and do a good job in an anchor job . this drive is what is slowly driving his beautiful girlfriend grace  jennifer aniston  away . when the final straws are executed  he  s quick to not laugh  but yell in the face of god  who in turn gives bruce his powers . bruce then makes his life better for himself  until he  s guilted into helping others  where he then continues to miss the point of his powers . meanwhile  his constant excitement about his own life makes him more selfish  leaving his relationship on dangerous ground .  br    br   ok  that was kinda long . but as a plot  it works well . the step  by  step fashion in which we meet the challenges of being god is much better than clustering his problems together  and is able to hide itself fairly well .  br    br   as you probably know from hearing about this movie in the first place  carrey  s pitch  perfect acting stays in character  which  luckily enough  is him   and controls and gives atmosphere to the movie scene by scene . whether they would admit it or not  the role was written or rewritten exclusively for carrey . without him  the humour would turn flat  as humour is half execution . and the humour is very good in the first place . but without carrey  it would kinda feel like a it  s a wonderful life wannabe .  br    br   jennifer aniston is great and  no matter what some may say  does not act like the only excuse for the third act . at least  you don  t think that when you see her . she gives a heartfelt performance and makes you forget you  re watching a movie  she and carrey feel very much like a real couple .  br    br   the movie feels ggooooodd  see the movie to understand   has a very nice feeling  tackles the idea appropriately and better than expected and overall should never have been called slapped together just to save carrey  s career  which wasn  t goin  anywhere .  .  ,1
what an overlooked    s soundtrack . i imagine john travolta sang some of the songs but in watching the movie it did seem to personify everything that was   s cheese . clearly movies that rely on mechanical bulls  bartenders and immature relationships were in style . the best was his lousy texas accent . compare that to friday night lights . i suggest watching cocktail and stir crazy to start really getting into the dumbing down of film . also  as a side note made in america with ted danson and whoopie goldberg is an awesomely bad movie . i was so shocked to realize i had never watched it . one more weird movie of this genre would have to include cadilac man with robin williams . just remember all of these big stars played big roles in these cheesy movies . . tom cruise  richard pryor  robin williams and john travolta  ,1
i enjoy watching western films but this movie takes the biscuit . the script and dialogue is laughable . the acting was awful  where did they get them from  music was ok i have to say . luckily i didn  t buy or rent the movie but its now disposed of .  br    br   i was geared up at the beginning when the stranger  martin sheen  started to tell his story . i have to admit i did enjoy the confrontation between hopalong and tex where hopalong shot tex  s finger off and told him to practise for   years to reach his league . but thats where it all went pear shaped thereafter . i had to watch the whole film in the hope that it would get better  never did .  ,0

when i go to see a movie about zombie  s  i  m not expecting oscar calibre performances  or writing on the level of the godfather  but i do expect the actors to at least not look like their straining to read their cue cards  and dialogue that doesn  t sound like it was typed out   minutes before the actor reads it into the camera . this movie was just awful  i actually got up and left about   minutes in and went next door and watched cold creek manor  that wasn  t very good either  but it seemed like citizen kane compared to this pile of crap . on the plus side  the girls were very pretty  that  s probably the only thing that kept me in my seat for longer than the first  minutes  in fact i left after the hottest one got killed  there wasn  t anything to hold my interest after that .  ,0
much like orson welles thirty years earlier  mike sarne was given  the biggest train set in the world  to play with  but unfortunately lacked the ability to do anything more than watch his train set become a train wreck that is still spoken of with shock and a strange sort of awe . despite post  modern interpretations purporting somehow to see it as a gay or even feminist tract  the fact of the matter is that it was a major disaster in     and remains one today . how anyone given the resources at mr sarne  s disposal could have screwed up so royally remains a closely  guarded secret . only michael cimino ever came close with the political and artistic armageddon that constitutes  heaven  s gate  . both films appeared to be ego trips for their respective directors but at least mr cimino had made one of the great movies of the     s before squandering the studio  s largesse  whereas mr sarne had only the rather fey  joanna  in his locker . furthermore   heaven  s gate  could boast some memorable and well  handled set  pieces where  tragically   myra breckinridge  s cupboard was bare . simply put  it is overwhelmingly the worst example of biting the hand that feeds in the history of hollywood .  ,0
they constructed this one as a kind of fantasy man from snowy river meets butch cassidy and the sundance kid  and just for a romantic touch ned and joe get to play away with high class talent  the bored young wives of wealthy older men . ok  there are lots of myths about ned kelly  but there are also a lot of well documented facts  still leaving space for artistic creativity in producing a good historical dramaticisation . i mean  this is not the robin hood story  not the arthurian legends  not beowulf  not someone whose life is so shrouded in the mists of many many centuries past that any recreation of their life and times is    guesswork . it  s only a couple of lifetimes ago . my own grandparents were already of school age when ned was hanged .  br    br   so it  s silly me for fancifully imagining this movie was a serious attempt to tell the kelly story . having recently read peter carey  s excellent novel  the true history of the kelly gang  i had eagerly anticipated that this would be in similar vein . but no  the fact is that mick jagger  s much derided     kelly was probably far closer to reality  and a better movie overall  which isn  t saying a whole lot for it .  br    br   glad it only cost me two bucks to hire the dvd  i  ll give it      and that  s only because some of the nice shots of the australian bush make me feel generous .  ,0
this movie is fun to watch  doesnt have much of a plot  well  there isn  t a plot   but there are good jokes and situations that you will laugh at . the basic storyline is cheech is trying to have a nice date  while chong is partying with cheech  s cousin  they smoke dope  go in a music store  a massage parlor  a comedy club  and even go into someones house they don  t even know  rated r  ,1
overall performance   at last the long waiting aag hits the screens . unfortunately  it couldn  t set progressive fire in the audience . the first best thing to talk about the movie is the idea of remaking the mighty sholay . and varma made a nice choice of changing the total backdrop of the movie . if he repeated the same ramghad backdrop  people will again say there is nothing new in this . different background is appreciative but the way he presented it is not worthy . right from the start of his career with siva in telugu  he had been using the same lighting and kind of background . i seriously dunno this guy varma considers about lighting or not or may be he has no other lighting technique other than like gordon willis godfather . it  s all dutch dutch dutch dutch . why would some body use so many dutch angles and extreme closeup shots        the shot division is lame . characters couldn  t carry an emotion  performances are not to their mark  storytelling is worse  background is really really terrible .  br    br   babban  amitabhz been over prioritized to his job . varma produced great villains like bikumatre  bhavtakur das  mallik bhai but this time he failed in carving the all time best characters of hindi cinema . there  s no comparison of gabbar with babban . babban is a more psycho rather than a villain  still he has a soft corner for his brother  it  s a gift in this movie  . amitabhz performance is not to his mark . his appearance itself is pathetic . the scar on his nose  symbolizes forgotten villains of black and white cinema . what ever they worked on babban is not successful . babban is no comparison with gabbar .  br    br   narsimha  the first best thing about this character is not to put audience in suspense about his hands . if varma did that  it would be like teaching abcd to a bachelor degree holder . itz good he opened the secret early . but the flashback is pathetic . varma couldn  t use a great actor like mohanlal to his mark .  br    br   durga  the only character with betterment . this character has been improved with satisfactory changes and was used according to the story .  br    br   heroo  raj  ghunguroo  no body bothers or at least considers these character . the utter failure of movie starts when director could not work on the close friendship between our heroz . these characters carry nothing to this movie .  br    br   ramgopalvarma  his quality is degrading  diminishing . aag totally can be treated as a c grade movie . sholay is a fire of revenge  problem of a town  meaning for true friendship and highly appreciated nuisance and fun by dharmendra . aag never carried an emotion with its characters . storytelling is too weak that it could not make audience feel sympathy for the characters . don  t compare aag with sholay  still u will not like it .  br    br   if you dare watch this movie . you will be burnt alive in ramgopal varma ki aag  ,0
i recently watched caprica again and thought i might as well come and write up a review  i first saw this right after i saw the series finale of battlestar galactica  being a big drooling fan boy of the show left me clinging onto anything i could of the shows universe  so i didn  t know what to expect . . . but i did come out with a smile though i must admit . . .  br    br   the story starts off dramatically on planet of caprica and we are introduced with a variety of interesting characters . . . i won  t give too much away but there is a dramatic event that dictates the course of the story but i suggest you watch this .  br    br   must say . . . esai morales is one hell of an actor he pulled off a young joseph adama . . .  father of the admiral in battlestar galactica  i found his acting spot on and i could believe that he is the father of william adama from bsg . . .  br    br   also eric stoltz fits his role precisely . . .  special note it was good to see polly walker outside of rome  don  t sit down and watch caprica with the expectation of it being like battlestar galactica because the story line is pretty straight forward and anyone can watch it . . without having to have see bsg  .  br    br   this show is a well written drama for those who like there drama with a bit of a sci  fi kick   ,1
piece of subtle art . maybe a masterpiece . doubtlessly a special story about the ambiguity of existence . tale in kafka style about impossibility of victory or surviving in a perpetual strange world . the life is  in this film  only exercise of adaptation . lesson about limits and original sin  about the frailty of innocence and error of his ways .  br    br   leopold kessle is another joseph k . images of trial and same ambiguous woman . and europa is symbol of basic crisis who has many aspects like chimeric wars or unavailing search of truth  essence  golden age .  br    br   methaphor or parable  the movie is history of disappointed  s evolution . war  peace  business or lie are only details of gelatin  time . hypocrisy is a mask . love  a convention . the sacrifice  only method to hope understanding a painful reality .  ,1
dominion tank police is without a shell of a doubt  one of the most amazing shows ever produced  but not just in the field of animation . while the first part  acts  and   mostly consists of action and fun  the second part is more serious and one should not treat the second part in the exact same way as first part . the subtleties are truly out of this world and the characterization is beyond brilliant . you must have an extra degree of intelligence to appreciate the intricacies of the second part  acts   and   . i do have some complaints though . in the first part  the tank bonaparte quite literally jumps over a tank shell and it did not make any sense at all . one might also question the plausibility of bonaparte jumping on the wing of helicopter gunship even though it was cool . buaku rules .  ,1
steve biko was a black activist who tried to resist the white minority governed south africa in much the same way as gandhi tried to resist the british empire  s colonialism in india . richard attenborough  s film cry freedom is not about biko or apartheid as much as it is about donald woods  the white liberal newspaper editor who risked his life trying to tell biko  s story . the film has a jarring point of view switch after biko dies in prison from tortuous behavior at the hands of south african  police  . woods  played by kevin kline  must choose whether to do the right thing and flee the country to publish books about biko or allow his wife  played by penelope wilton  to pressure him into forgetting about the books . in that case  biko dies in vain . what begins as a life  changing friendship between biko and woods degenerates into a standard by the numbers escape over the border yarn after biko  s death . oscar  nominated denzel washington is good in only his fourth film as biko  but something is wrong in a film that tries to depict the struggles of apartheid by focusing more on the trials of a white family for more than half the film . attenborough would have served his topic better by focusing on biko  s rise to prominence instead of beginning where biko befriended woods . perhaps a black actor in a leading role in a     hour film wasn  t exactly conducive to big box office  but the film was a tremendous box office flop anyway . film politics aside  the film still entertains and sends a message or two  albeit  in pg  sanitized fashion .  of  stars .  ,1
the seventh sign has a great opening hook as the israeli defence force come across a terrorist base . this is the type of hook that is a must when writing a script  it grabs the reader  audience and the introduction of david bannon as he rents a room from abby and russell quinnn telegraphs the point that this is a man whos not who he says he is . however after the great opening third i found the rest of the movie confusing and uninvolving with a large number of plotholes and isnt all that different from umpteen other supernatural thrillers that ive seen  ,0
when i saw this  documentary   i was disappointed to see serbian propaganda in action once again . even though serbia and its nationalist politics is main reason of yugoslavian breakup  it is not mentioned in this  documentary   which is made by bogdanovich whose name tells us that he is serbian and his movie that he is far from being objective . it is one in the set of lies pushed by milosevic regime . everyone else is guilty only serbians were right and victims  even though most of the war criminals tried in hague are serbs  even though serbs are one who have committed genocide against bosnians  and attacked slovenia  croatia  and bosnia all independent nations recognized by the un . breakup of yugoslavia was not avoidable because serbians did not want to release the grip their nationalism has put on federal yugoslav government  so slovenia  croatia  macedonia  and bosnia were forced to become independent nations in order to protect their interests . if you are interested in an objective documentary about breakup of yugoslavia  and fact led documentary this is not it . you should watch  yugoslaviadeath of a nation   made by discovery channel and bbc .  ,0
 . . . or maybe it just is this bad . the plot is a cheap rehash of the first  which is weird  since it  s supposed to be a prequel  not a sequel . pretty much the entire movie seems like a cheap remake of the first  with scenes mimicking the things that happened in the first  only a lot more ridiculous and unlikely . where the first had a great cast  this one consist of b  list actors and rejects . the acting is mostly horrendously bad . half of the good lines in the movie are taken directly from the first  as is nearly every major character  including the ones who weren  t in the first movie . i realize this was made up by a tv series pilot episode  but that  s no excuse . they didn  t have to turn the  bad  footage into a movie . only one thing is marginally good  and that  s the erotic sequences . however  as these are nowhere near as good as the ones in the first  even this isn  t raising it above a rating of  . if you have a chance to see it for free  and you  re a straight guy  it could be worth checking out  if you want something erotic that isn  t porn . if not  avoid at all costs .      ,0
not the most successful television project john cleese ever did   strange case  has the feel of a first draft that was rushed into production before any revisions could be made . there are some silly ideas throughout and even a few clever ones  but the story as a whole unfortunately doesn  t add up to much .  br    br   arthur lowe is a hoot  though  as dr . watson  bionic bits and all .  good lord .   ,1
domino is a great movie . it  s about a young woman names domino harvey  kiera knightley  who becomes a bounty  hunter because of her boredom with her lifestyle . she joins with two fellow hunters  mickey rourke  edgar ramirez  and the adventures begin . the script is good . very down  to  earth and realistic with the tone of the film . the only problem i had with this movie is that it concentrates on the different things that they do  instead of the character of domino .  br    br   even with that  kiera knightley gives a fierce performance . she shows the right amount of anger and dedication in this performance . mickey rourke follows up his oscar  worthy performance in  sin city  with another tough  guy performance . edgar ramirez really doesn  t do anything except speak spanish every once in a while and stare at kiera . delroy lindoi gives a good supporting performance . mo  nique was herself  although she did surprise me on one particular scene . lucy liu has great chemistry with kiera knightley in her scenes with her .  br    br   the best thing about the movie though  is the direction . tony scott  s fast  paced style really brings the movie to life . the cinematography is some of the best  i  ve ever seen . it takes a regular movie and puts on acid . all the blacks are blacker  the whites are brighter  and it has a sort of green glow to it . the action scenes are exhilarating .  br    br   overall if you liked sin city  man on fire  you  ll like domino .  ,1
highly memorable  intelligent and suspenseful movie from one of french movies  true geniuses  the formidably able henri verneuil . the plot is an exact parallel of the jfk assassination  and takes place in a non  descript  fictional country . the film  visually as well as plot  wise  is razor  sharp . shot with meticulous precision  it follows henry volnay  the procuror who takes on himself to unravel the coup . in many ways  it  s a very disturbing movie  not the least for the cold and analytical precision of its comment on a so  called modern state  s inner workings . the atmosphere and characters are all utterly believable  and verneuil left nothing to chance in its tight plotting . on another level  this relatively little  known movie just had a   years head  start on oliver stone  who was acclaimed for the  jfk  movie  a inferior film in many areas  the least of which not being credibility . . .  br    br   it  s a masterpiece  any cinema lover should see it  preferably in its original french version with subs .  ,1
this film is a portrait of the half  spastic teenage boy benjamin who has to visit a boarding school because of his lousy marks in math . he didn  t make the best experiences in life before and got serious self  esteem issues . after a rough start at his new school  he starts making friends  falls in love with a girl and does some american pieish teenage stuff .  br    br   beside some comedy elements  the film is told in a very serious way  focussing on benjamin and his problems .  br    br   if you already don  t like this story outline  save your time and watch something else . if you do  please be aware of the following  br    br     benjamin is a total loser . whatever he does  he does it terribly wrong and then he goes for self  pity all the time . for me he wasn  t that kind of  charming loser  who you can feel sympathy for and laugh with . instead he and his behavior really annoyed me and with my own teenage years not so far behind i could barely stand watching .  br    br     the film hardly tries to be realistic and the story seems to be but from my experience the characters just aren  t  except for janosch maybe  . and yes  i know this film is based on an auto  biography written by a    year old  but having some experiences with german schools and german youth myself  i don  t believe him .  br    br     showing the sexual awakening really is an important thing for a film with this subject . but i doubt that teenage boys do an  ejaculate on the cookie   contest where everyone has to hit a cookie with his sperm during mass  masturbation in the woods and the loser has to eat the sperm  wet cookie afterwards . although it kinda amused me in a contemptible way  it  s nor funny neither underlining the serious attempts of this film .  br    br     there  s a sub  plot about benjamin  s family and his father betraying his wife  still  i don  t know why it  s there and where to put it . it just bored me .  br    br   well  i personally hated this film for having the character of benjamin  being without a message  concept  scheme  whatever and it  s failing attempts to be dramatic and serious . however  i can image that some people may find it sensible and touching . if you liked  the other sister  you  ll probably like this one  too . i hated both .  br    br      year old boys shouldn  t write an autobiography and if they do  it doesn  t seem to be the best idea to make a film out of it .  br    br    out of   .  ,0
this is easily the most disappointing  least gratifying movie of the entire so  called blacksploitation genre  which  by the way  are films we generally enjoy a great deal in our home . rather than being  exploitation  or demeaning  these films actually provide a priceless insight into an era . well  not bucktown .  br    br   in this story  duke returns to bucktown to operate the night club left to him by his recently deceased brother . he quickly learns that the city is entirely controlled by a corrupt police force  bleeding protection money out of all the local businesses . duke resists  and determines that he will rescue the city from the corrupt police . unfortunately  he does so by calling in a posse of his friends  these people are vaguely explained as some former black  militants who have worked with duke on  jobs  in the past  and they simply murder the entire police department in cold blood . and literally in the presence of hundreds of witnesses who do nothing to stop it . ignorance is not a justification for murder  and it would have been much more entertaining to see the cracker police suffer for their actions as opposed to merely getting whacked in the street . while revenge is a ubiquitous and generally satisfying theme in films of this genre  it is a far cry from seeing pam grier track down the thugs who off  ed her family  cuss them out  give them a jujitsu ass  kickin  and set their  fro on fire . that has art  and a reason for existing  and merits a level of respect that is quite undeserved by simply shooting someone in the back . of course  in this bizarre tale  she is playing a woman completely under the man  s thumb  afraid of the crackers who run her town and oppress her people . indeed  her advice to duke is   run  man  they gonna kill you    br    br   following the sickening and gratuitous violence  we are expected to believe that the town  s mayor wholeheartedly condones the actions of duke and his friends  congratulating them and offering to throw a parade in their honor  as opposed to  say  calling the district attorney to press capital murder charges against them and have them taken into custody . duke  s posse declines the parade and instead opts to fill the numerous vacancies on the police force created by their recent killing spree . they immediately prove to be even more corrupt than their cracker police predecessors  to quote the mayor   they are ten times worse than what we had before    . now duke finds he must again rescue the citizens of bucktown from corrupt  protection  racket law enforcement officials and again make it safe for decent folk to operate a prostitution business in the streets . unfortunately  duke has already lost all moral high ground and sympathy due a hero  as he was a willing participant in the murder of the original police force . i wouldn  t have cared one way or the other if he had rescued bucktown or gotten plugged himself at this point . i suppose we are to be entertained by the clever way duke has to outsmart the new police goons  but in reality the film has now just become an opera of gratuitous violence  duke murders all of his former friends and allies in cold blood with the same absence of compassion he had when gunning down the cracker police . duke is a pig .  br    br   finally  when everyone in town but duke  aretha  and the employees of the local brothel are dead and bleedin  in the street  our hero and heroine walk off into the night as though they had some admirable qualities or redeeming values they don  t . duke is merely a murderous thug and aretha his enabling misogynist accomplice . if you are interested in this genre of film  by all means  i highly recommend them  see coffy  foxy brown  truck turner  blacula  sheba babybut if in the process you should run across this dvd  throw it as far away as you possibly can  drop it like it  s hot  it should be treated as one would treat a glowing puddle of nuclear waste  there is no single film in the entire blacksploitation era that is not dramatically more entertaining  satisfying and populated with more sympathetic and admirable characters than this piece of slime  obviously written by and targeted at some hormonally imbalanced high school sophomores .  ,0
the premise of the movie has been explained and if you  ve gotten this far you don  t me to pretend that i  m a movie critic . with that being said my own opinion of the movie is quite low . i  m a fan of takashi miike but this goes down in the category of his not so great work along with doa  and   and some others  many  .  br    br   the movie seems to get a free pass because it is a takashi film and nothing takashi does can be wrong . this is a highschoolers approach to cinema . for the rest of us we  ll find and hour and a half of a kid screaming for no real reason completely annoying  and yes  this does take away from the film   the pace of the film almost reaching levels of rigomortis  and the acting . . . well . . . hmmm .  br    br   if one is a takashi fan you  ll see it regardless to peak your interests . it lacks any originality  see the neverending story  or any character development from the lead character in the face of conflict other then a quite superficial one .  br    br   as it has been pointed out this is the first film miike has been credited with co  writing  but that doesn  t mean much as non of what we  d hope would be miike  s personality would spill over into the screen . all we get are some of the token miike shots vis the director of photography .  br    br   the movie had the potential to be something great . the premise is not a difficult one to run wild with . but this one seemed to have been run into the ground .  br    br   my suggestion is if you  re just getting into miike is go with some of the standards like gozu  ichi  and audition . then movie into his works like blue  s harp  fudoh  rainy dog  bird people of china .  ,0
honestly  i don  t know what  s funnier  this horrific remake  or the comments on this board . masterpiece  s review had me in tears  that  s so funny . anyway  this movie is the among the worst movies ever  and certainly the bottom of the barrel for sequels . the  omen  name on the title made me stop and watch it this morning on hbo  but it  s a slap in the face to the other three  especially the original . there are so many classically bad moments  but my favorite is the guy catching fire from the juggler at the psychic fair   good times  this movie is to the omen series what  scary movie  is to the entire genre . avoid unless you  re looking for a good laugh .  ,0
a young man named court is loved by everyone . his painful bloody death brings everyone closer . you can find other symbols and allusions throughout the movie . whether predictable or not  and irrespective of ecclesiastical beliefs  this is a moving story  full of milieu and sensuality .  br    br   one other thing  someone mentioned that his fate was so quick that it didn  t seem plausible . but the elements for this are set up subtly . note what his mom says about bringing his lunch out to the field . note how he is holding the steering wheel and his gloves . he is sweaty and operating dangerous equipment . to this day  tractors are pretty dangerous .  ,1
this movie should be required viewing for all librarians or would  be librarians . all of the best lines are directly related to librarianship . the public library vs . academic library argument is a classic argument waged among librarians and library school students . it also breaks many librarian stereotypes . librarians might even be capable of having fun   even if they don  t usually have sex in the romance languages section   the best movie about librarians  desk set  with katherine hepburn and spencer tracy  of course .   ,1
nothing in this movie is funny . i thought the premise  giving a human the libido of a randy ram  was interesting and should provide for some laughs . wrong  there is simply nothing funny about the movie . for example  the main character making a pass at a goat in heat in the middle of a farmer  s yard is not funny  it borders on obscenity . they are toying around with bestiality in this film on one level  and it just aint funny .  br    br   we all know that dogs will eat anything  anywhere  anytime . the main character doing this with everything  everywhere  everytime is also not funny . it becomes a cliche .  br    br   rob schneider is  i guess  acceptable in the role . by this  i mean that he  s not a bad actor  but with rotten material it  s difficult to comment on quality . however  coleen haskell  the other half of the human  romantic leads  does one count the number of animals that the main character has interest in as romantic leads too    seems embarrassed by the whole thing  as well she should be . she seems to be acting in some kind of vacuum  detached from all the other actors in the movie .  br    br   see this film only if you wish to be bored by tasteless  dull  repetitive material .  ,0
this is a modest  character driven comedy  filmed in brazil on a low budget . the premise is familiar  the same as in the      s danny kaye movie on the double someone who  as a joke  does an impression of a famous person then is dragooned to impersonate the person for real .  br    br   the contrast between the two leads is highly effective . raul julia as the german  paradorian secret policeman  is tall  cool  menacing and latin . he sports a deliberately obvious blond dye job . richard dreyfus  animated  short  new york jewish  is funny and sympathetic . there are many references and inside jokes about show business .  br    br   the setting is clearly modeled on paraguay . paraguay was indeed ruled from the early fifties to the late eighties by gen . alfredo stroessner  an unelected military dictator whose father had emigrated from germany . but writer  director mazurszky reveals his ignorance of local conditions when he paints parador  paraguay as a typical latin american tyranny  with huge disparities in wealth and an active guerrilla insurgency . further in this vein  mazursky casts comic jonathan winters as an american retiree who in truth is c . i . a . station chief in parador and a figure so powerful that he can give the president of the country a profanity  laced chewing out .  br    br   in fact the u . s . has little influence in paraguay  which is largely without the social and racial tensions seen elsewhere in the region . this is due to the country  s having fought long and costly wars against much larger neighbors in the   th and   th centuries . the male population was nearly wiped out both times but the society that emerged was patriotic  racially homogeneous and strongly united .  br    br   on yet another level  there is a bow to feminism in the form of the character madonna . played by brazilian actress sonia braga  madonna is a former nightclub dancer who is the body  stockinged presidential pleasure girl at the film  s start but is seen on television as president herself at the end   now politically and cosmetically correct  no makeup  hair demurely pulled back  swept to office by a velvet revolution .  br    br   the one time that such an event actually happened in latin america  the administration of argentina  s isabel peron  not the beloved evita  who never held office  lasted two years after the death of her husband  legendary supremo juan peron .  ,1
i just don  t understand why this movie is getting beat  up in here . jeez . it is mindless  it isn  t polished and it is  as i am reading  wasted on some . the cast of this movie plays their characters to the  t   if you watched permanent midnight and became a ben stiller fan then yes you will be disappointed  . these are misunderstood  well  intentioned misfits trying to save the city  world with nothing but grit and determination . the problem is they don  t realize their limits until the big showdown and that  s the point  this is  times the movie that the spy who shagged me was yet gets panned by the same demographic group  likely the same people who feel the first ap movie pales in comparison to the sequel . i just don  t get it . the jokes work on more then one level if you didn  t get it i know what level you  re at .  ,1

think of a no  budget version of china syndrome being directed by a film student who idolizes john woo and you  ll get  power play .  the idea was good  but the execution  acting  and dialog absolutely killed it  not to mention ridiculous amounts of violence and disaster sequences that was used to compensate for lack of substance and development of the more interesting parts of the movie .  br    br   this is the story of a reporter investigating the disappearance of three members of a guerrilla activist group who mysteriously went missing after they broke into the offices of a power plant that is suspected to be causing a frenzy of earthquake . the rather cavalier reporter  going up against what should  ve been a more ruthless bunch of company execs  is chased around town  along with anyone he speaks to  in order to  clean  whatever conclusive evidence might remain of the plant  s faults .  br    br   unfortunately  there is no real sense of emergency because the characters interact with much hesitancy  coupled with idiotic dialog and a lot of horrible acting . not to mention  the viewer  who may only be attracted to the movie for it  s action genre appeal  is forced to endure a mounting body count and ridiculous amounts of violent shoot em  ups plus earthquake disaster scenes . all of the focus was put in the wrong place to apologetically compensate for the lack of direction and more interesting sequence of events that should  ve propelled the story . it might  ve been much better had the filmmakers focused more on a thriller  and paid greater attention to developing the corruption aspects of this story . creepy villains  a naive reporter  and those who attempt to alert the reporter of the wrong  doing afoot . it is formulaic  but at least it would  ve been entertaining .  ,0

kabei our mother       is a poetic and sublime beauty from japan . a real weeper  i had heard great reviews for the film and rented it from netflix . am i glad i did  in many ways this film reminded me of the old style of japanese classic film  making from the      s and      s that i  ve come to love so much  such as seen in yasujiro ozu pictures   the title credits even begin in the same way  with the japanese letters  characters  in red against neutral color burlap material . i immediately thought this director loves ozu . the same style was used too mostly indoor sets with only a few outdoor scenes . even a couple of  pillow shots   as roger ebert calls them . the strength of the film is built on the love of the characters for one another .  br    br   the story follows the lives of a japanese family before  and during  and after  world war two . the mother takes care of her growing girls the best she can after the father  a university professor  is arrested for anti  war sympathies . he  s never freed and only has a few brief meetings with his wife in prison before he dies of starvation and disease . meanwhile a former student of the professor comes by often to help take care of the mother and two girls . he begins to fall in love with the mother and is a substitute father for the two girls . but war starts and he  s drafted and they have to say an abrupt farewell . will they ever express their love for one another  will he ever return from the war   br    br   there is so much heart and gentle spirit in the performance of the lead actress  sayuri yoshinaga . she  s almost a madonna type  she  s so beautiful  big soulful eyes and flawless skin . the actor who plays the student is phenomenal as well his name is tadanobu asano . what a sensitive performance . there is no macho in him at all he  s gentle and kind . i  d certainly love to see both of these two in other movies . i think i  ll check to see what  s available for them . the two little child actresses are wonderful too .  br    br   the film is just released on ntsc dvd for american audiences  with very easy to read english subtitles . i gave it a   out of   on the imdb . i cried almost as much as with the japanese film classic twenty  four eyes       . don  t miss this film   ,1

of course i would have to give this film   out of   as my uncle was the main screenplay writer of once upon a crime . rodolfo sonego wrote screenplays for over   years living in italy . he was a great story teller and someone suggested that he put his stories into writing . so rodolfo sonego did . if you check out his biography  you can see the number of movies that have been made in italy . alberto sordie was the main actor that starred in his stories . my uncle visited australia and my town  in     to check out locations for  a girl in australia  and created a great movie about a proxy bride after the second world war . you can see his humor in all his movies . i found a copy of this movie on dvd recently . great  ,1
i heard and read many praising things about  midnight meat train   which is based on a short story written by no less than clive barker and supposedly the best adaptation of his work since the original  hellraiser  that he directed himself  but so far i can only express very mixed sentiments about my viewing experience . the most appropriate term to summarize the whole film in just word is nauseating  the violence is sadistic and extreme  which undoubtedly attracts fanatic young horror enthusiasts  but it  s also indescribably gratuitous and exploitative . normally speaking  i  m very pro  violence but it has to at least serve some kind of purpose . the butchering  literally  depicted in  midnight meat train  is exclusively meant to shock and to repulse the viewers with weak nerve systems and easily upset stomachs  and even that isn  t fully effective due to the use of digital computer effects . there are more shortcomings  some even bigger than the pointless gore  but perhaps i should focus on the good elements first . the basic concept is definitely promising and multiple sequences  like the chase in the freezer room  for example  are literally oozing with nail  biting suspense and macabre atmosphere . unfortunately the pacing is very uneven and the elaboration of the potentially fantastic plot is made unnecessarily convoluted . presumably the processing of a short story into a long feature film scenario is responsible for the pacing irregularities  but i honestly feel they could have done more with the denouement as well as with the character played by vinnie jones . the plot introduces leon  an aspiring photographer in new york whose agent advises to search for the truly menacing face of the city through sinister pictures . leon then becomes obsessed with stalking an introvert and suspiciously behaving butcher who always awaits the midnight train . leon  s right  as the butcher turns out to be a relentless serial killer who literally crushes his victims with a big hammer  but the killer  s motivations and behavior suggest there  s something far more substantial going on the rails at night .  midnight meat train  takes place in naturally unsettling locations like subway stations at night and animal abattoirs  plus the film also benefices of good acting performances and a truckload of downright disturbing images  like cadavers on meat hooks and train carriages smeared in blood   but director ryhei kitamura   versus    godzilla final wars   doesn  t take full advantage of it all . the ending leaves a whole lot questions unanswered and  even if clive barker meant to have like this  i still think we deserved a slightly more clarifying finale .  midnight meat train  is a somewhat intriguing and definitely haunting film  but not without defaults . it  s not intended for easily offended viewers  but maybe people looking for plot coherence and clarity should leave it alone as well .  ,0
i  m surprised that no one yet has mentioned that there are two versions of this same film . the lion  s share of the footage in both is identical  but here is where they differ in one version  the version i have seen most often on broadcast tv   the group of clerics guarding the gateway consists of the  brotherhood of the protectors   a  fictional  splinter group of priests and brothers  excommunicated  by the church . in the other version  which i  ve seen only once on tv  the clerics guarding the gateway are depicted as priests of the official church  meaning the archdiocese of new york  or perhaps brooklyn  . also  in the former version  in most of the pertinent scenes  the clerics are referred to as  brothers   and in some scenes  you can see where the lips say  father  so  and  so but the dubbed audio says  brother  so  and  so . in the latter version  i believe everyone is referred to as  father  .  br    br   in any event  it seems that one of these two versions is more or less a partial re  shooting of the other  with all  brotherhood of the protector  scenes re  shot as  archdiocese  scenes  or vice versa .  kind of reminds me of the raymond burr cutaway scenes in  godzilla   . i have videotaped both versions off broadcast tv  so no  i  m not imagining this . can anyone shed some more light on the story behind these two versions of the film   ,1
this is the kind of movie hollywood needs to make more of . no extravagant props  no car chases  no clever one  liners . just people dealing with being people .  br    br   william macy plays an unlikely hitman who works for his father  donald sutherland . macy is the dutiful son  sutherland is the domineering father . son wants out of the business  father won  t let him . macy loves his own son  played beautifully by david dorfman   the ring   . he also starts to fall in love with neve campbell  a girl he meets in the waiting room of his psychiatrist  s office .  br    br   it  s an interesting juxtaposition of characters and the film follows the reluctant killer as he balances his own needs with those of his family . there are many touching scenes  especially between macy and his little boy . and as you  d expect in a film with william macy in it  there  s a bit of humor too .  br    br   excellent job all around  actors and director . nice to know they can still make a good film in hollywood on a small budget .  ,1
becky harris plays the female shopper whose misfortune it is to be in the store at the wrong time and obviously only purpose to be in this film is to supply a reason to wear out remote controls  miss harris seems to me to be in her fifties or older when she first comes on the scene . once the red haired thug is done with her it becomes apparent that this is no aarp queen . if these are not some of the finest assets ever displayed on celluloid  i want someone to clue me in . absolutely breathtaking in my opinion and i literally wore out my vhs copy capturing her charms . i would like to know if this movie is available on dvd .  br    br   the rest of this movie really is not worthy of mention . i was hoping to see something fairly convincing and intelligent  however i was disappointed on both counts . god bless becky harris   ,0
is it a coincidence that orca was made two years after jaws  orca isn  t exactly a  jaws rip off  but it is obvious that it tried to profit from jaws  s success . first of all orca in my opinion was a bad movie  not terrible but definitely not good  average at best .  br    br   the plot is basically a male killer whale  orca  after seeing its mate and its unborn calf killed by a fisherman seeks revenge . i couldn  t stand to watch this movie again . the direction of this film is poor and when compared to jaws it looks like the director  producers  and writers were almost talentless .  br    br   as for the acting  it was very average and believable  however the actual characters aren  t the least bit likable . the effects were alright for its time and the footage of the killer whale looked pretty good .  br    br   the violence is confusing  bloody  and not recommended for more sensitive people . the music is overdone and very loud  drowning out the sound effects and irritating at times . i hated the way they exaggerated the intelligence of the killer whale  killer whales don  t mate with only one mate as depicted in orca  .  br    br   overall this movie was bad  poor in my opinion  because of the reasons listed above . some people may appreciate this film more because of the concept of vengeance amongst animals and humans so i  m not going to bash this movie and i can understand why some people may like it .  br    br   my rating  .      but for its concept possibly a       ,0
story says that on that on december         a small group of thirty  three people was gathered at paris  s salon indien du grand caf to witness the cinmatographe  a supposedly new invention that resulted from the work done by a couple of photographers named august and louis lumire . the small audience reunited that day  some by invitation  most due to curiosity  didn  t really know what to expect from the show  and when a stationary photograph appeared projected on a screen  most thought that the cinmatographe was just another fancy devise to present slide  show projections . until the photograph started to move . what those thirty  three people experienced in awe that cold day of december was the very first public screening of a moving picture being projected on a screen history was being written and cinema as we know it was born that day .  br    br   of the   short movies that were shown during that historic day   la sortie des usines lumire   literally  exiting the lumire factory   was the very first to be screened . the film shows the many workers of the lumire factory as they walk through the gates of the factory  leaving the building at the end of a hard day of work . while a very basic  actuality film   movie depicting a real event   the movie took everyone in the audience by surprise  as their concept of moving pictures was limited to edison  s  peep show  machines  the kinetoscope   the brothers  invention was like nothing they had seen before and so the audience stood in awe  as the people and the horses moved across the screen . the idea wasn  t entirely new  le prince shot the first movie as early as       but the way of showing the movie was simply revolutionary .  br    br    la sortie des usines lumire  would become the first in the long series of  actuality films  that the lumire would produce over the years . this primitive form of documentary was the brothers  favorite kind of film because they were more interested in the technological aspects of their invention than in the uses the cinmatographe could have . despite the initial lack of enthusiasm  after the first showing the cinmatographe became a great success and  la sortie des usines lumire  quickly became an iconic image of that first screening . it definitely wasn  t the first movie the brothers shot that year  and it probably wasn  t the best of the   movies shown that day  personally i think that  l  arroseur arros  was the best of the     however  it is really meaningful that the very first movie was the opening of a pair of gates  as literally  this movie opened the gates to cinema as we know it .      ,1
i  m not sure why spike lee made this train wreck of a movie and conned poor stevie wonder into eternally pairing his beautiful music with this theatrical mess . i also resent the way he uses profanity as a part of the normal prose of professional blacks . the abuse of his hold on ethnic movie goers is a shame . scenes which seem to be contrived out the blue and have nothing to do with the theme or sub themes  play as if some college kid wrote this . i especially detest the ludicrous scene where the two leads are playfully sparring for no reason at all and the cops come and rough up snipes . the overacting of the leads makes one feel as if spike has no respect for his viewers or he has no clue what a movie is all about . the final scene appears to be thrown in to justify the use of a sledge hammer to tack a point in . this movie also supports the myth that all people of culture use the f  word in casual conversation . i am hoping he will realize that the rest of his movies are in the same pool as this one where he is not growing as a film maker . i think his union with scorcesee in clockers was a wise move . he should stick to making documentaries like the four little colored girls . shock movies do not an oscar make .  ,0
being someone who lists night of the living dead at number three in her top five favorite movies of all time  and at the same time loving this student film parody  i feel i must defend this movie against the previously posted scathing reviews . this short but sweet opus has always been a crowd  pleaser at horror and science fiction movie marathons where those who attend have a love of the genre yet know not to take zombie movies too seriously . this film is a tribute to the original  not an insult . it is intended to be funny  and many others who i have heard chant for and applaud it agree with me that it succeeds . especially for those of us who have seen notld    times . watch for the director cameo as news reporter jeff drexel  and also if you have the opportunity catch his alien parody  loaf .  ,1
it could have been better had it been directed by someone with more experience . shumlin didn  t do a bad job but it is not a great work of cinematic art .  br    br   it is  however  a beautiful movie . i have loved it since local channels used to show it . graham greene is one of my favorite writers of the last century . some pretty bad movies were made from his novels and stories .  many love  the fallen idol  but i am not among them . i think i saw  brighton rock  once many years ago and liked it but maybe i  m simply thinking fondly of the novel .  this is superbly cast . charles boyer does not  it  s true  come across as spanish . but he seems to have the perfect temperament for this character   tired  wary  caring . lauren bacall is appealing as the british girl who falls for him . but the supporting players are the best katina paxinou is excellent . her performance is a little grand guignol  but i attribute that to the director . peter lorre  whom we first meet as he gives boyer a lesson in an esperanto  like universal language  is excellent   as always .  br    br   and wanda hendrix could break the hardest heart . she comes across as a precocious early teenager . the character wants to be helpful . she does her best .  br    br   i recommend this movie highly . not without reservations . the reservation is  primarily  that it is a little stolid . but the story and acting can scarcely be bettered .  ,1
i don  t think most of us would tend to apply the term  must  see  to action films  but i was very impressed at how good this film was and it deservedly gets the  must  see  stamp from me .  br    br   mandy played by shannon lee  daughter of the late and great bruce lee and sister of the late brandon lee  is recruited by martin  a professional thief to help pull off a diamond heist at a museum for a criminal syndicate  and get rewarded handsomely for it . little do they know that another pair of thieves  lucy and tommy  a pair of lovebirds   who were spurned earlier by mandy and martin to get in on the deal  are also planning to steal the diamond .  br    br   how each pair of thieves plans out the heist is a thrill to watch . things go awry  as martin and mandy unknowingly find themselves a step behind lucy and tommy .  br    br   you  ll find yourself rooting for these thieves as they find that they need each other to stay alive from the crime syndicate  who are not happy at all that the diamond is not in its hands .  br    br   action fans will not be disappointed  as there  s a healthy dose of gun battles  martial arts  and hand  to  hand combat sequences .  br    br   what is surprising is that  it  s not just the action that carries this film  but the romance and laughs  and i don  t mean your typical one  liners prevalent in action films  that sneak in .  br    br   it  s not easy to root for bad guys  but we get to see the human side of these thieves and the chemistry they develop .  br    br   a great film and one not to miss   br    br    out of    ,1
i guess its possible that i  ve seen worse movies  but this one is a real stinker  the plot is unremarkable but thats not the worst of it . the directing is no where close to what you would expect from andy ching . he  s capable of good work but failed to pull this movie together .  br    br   angie harmon  playing the female lead as a reporter dogging into who  s behind the assassination of the president  truly butchered the role . there was no chemistry with gooding  her demeanor was flat and wooden  and the  inch spike heels she wore throughout the movie were absurd . this outing for harmon places her solidly at the bottom of the  b  list .  br    br   and what was cuba gooding thinking    he has to his credit a number of outstanding performances  but this was far beneath what we  ve come to expect from him .  br    br   poor james woods and burt reynolds . poor poor poor poor poor .  ,0
this movie is flawed on many fronts . like many before it  it portrays more of the mythology of the alamo than the history . the production is poor  overall giving the impression of a welfare project for lots of actors who might have otherwise had to work on hollywood squares . this to me was the greatest flaw  i know the ages and general personalities of the real alamo protagonists and the geriatric ensemble of tv actors chosen to portray them never let any hint of believability intrude .  br    br   as a native texan  i grew up with the mythology . i later learned more about the history . i can accept a decent production from either perspective  although i prefer more historical accuracy   but this never gave me a chance to enjoy it . even john wayne  s or fess parker  s versions had more life than this stolid mess  while being only slightly less accurate .  br    br   very disappointing  avoid it .  ,0

saps at sea is evidently a pun on a gary cooper film  souls at sea . the title aptly describes the starring team  stan laurel and oliver hardy . who go on an ocean voyage to soothe ollie  s nerves only to run into escaped killer nick grainger . as played by rychard cramer  this criminal is both amusing and chilling  making him a fine foil for the boys  comedic characters . despite his powerful presence  cramer never upstages the boys  a tribute to stan and ollie  s beguiling charisma . that is as it should be  since the boys are supposed to be the protagonists in this film .  br    br   such is the charm of laurel and hardy  s personas that they elevate average material . for saps at sea has its slow spots . for instance  as a previous commentator has noted  a bit where a doctor  the delightfully flustered james finlayson  tries a balloon called  lung tester  on ollie  lacks punch . the scenario is very episodic  with the first part  taking place in the boys  apartment  almost completely unrelated to the second part where they go off to sea . but on the whole  the film is highly pleasant entertainment with a sufficiently brief running time so that it doesn  t wear out it  s welcome .  br    br   there  s a certain poignancy viewing the final collaboration between laurel and hardy and producer hal roach . i haven  t seen all of laurel and hardy  s post      films but those that i have seen don  t measure up to even the weakest hal roach products . in these later movies  laurel and hardy seem to be in an alien environment  deprived of such colorful supporting players like finlayson and charlie hall and marvin hately and leroy shield  s sprightly musical scores . they also aren  t the well  meaning and optimistic bumblers we know and love but in the later films  are either exasperating blockheads or pathetic misfits .  br    br   it is a pity that many hal roach laurel and hardy films are now generally unavailable to the public . even in a minor entry like saps at sea  one can see that laurel and hardy were great comedians . this was because hal roach  for the most part  allowed stan laurel  the guiding force behind the team  complete artistic freedom . once laurel lost his autonomy at other studios  the team lost much of its uniqueness .  ,1
  bad stuff this movie is real crap . bad stunts for one thing  they looked so fake i thought this was  the twilight zone  . the flashbacks are pretty much useless . one part of the movie he thinks taking his anger out on a window will make his life better . i wanna know the casting director and if he was high because the acting  even from the adults was horrid . a kissing scene in this movie even sucked . this movie killed the book . the book was great . i highly do not recommend this movie . not even for educational purposes .  br    br    good stuff i don  t know what i can say really . there is some suspense parts that get you going  but they are quickly shot down by the bad stunt work and acting .  br    br    my verdict do not watch .  ,0
i  ve seen the first of the dwarf  movies and sometimes i had little fun watching it . there are many famous tv  comedyactors appearing in the first part and presented  in fantasy costumes  typical little episodes of their stand  up  program and exactly that is the problem the second movie has to struggle with . everything was already there . . . . nothing new to obtain . you  re familiar with most of the often boring and dumb  jokes  and you always feel like their goal was to put in every comedylooser of the last decade who wants to get back on stage . there  s nothing important about the story typical fairy  tale story of rumpelstiltskin  without any importance . i expected something like that but that  s nothing i could complain about . i  m actually complaining about the lazy story writers who had an entire background story their only business was to get many jokes and parodies inside but they didn  t get it anyway . this crap is except the great appearance of helge schneider a total waste of time and money .  if you don  t like him then remove  points of my evaluation  if you like to save your money and get bad jokes then watch the crap that  s broad casted every friday evening on sat  or rtl for free . i  m sure you will recognize some  laugthers  i saw last night in cinema .  ,0
regardless of what personal opinion one may have of walerian borowczyk grotesque yet beautiful gem  la bte  of      one has to admit that this bizarre gem is an absolutely unique cinematic experience . borowczyk erotic fairy tale was banned in several countries for a long time  and it is quite obvious why this controversial gem fell victim to stuporous film censors .  la bte  is a fascinating blend of intense and beautiful fairy  tale  like atmosphere  quite explicit eroticism and genuine weirdness that bravely refuses to take any compromise . the fact that beastiality  of sorts  is one of the film  s central themes did certainly not help it with the censors  but it made it highly controversial and therefore known to a wider audience .  br    br   pierre de l  esperance  guy trjan   the head of a french aristocratic family  has arranged for his somewhat demented son mathurin  pierre benedetti  to marry lucy broadhurst  lisbeth hummel   the young and beautiful daughter of a wealthy english family . due to an old curse  mathurin  s uncle  marcel dali  is strictly against the wedding . when lucy and her mother arrive at the french estate  lucy immediately gets fascinated with a portrait of the   th century ancestor romilda  sirpa lane   and with an old book depicting bizarre drawings . the story soon descends into a bizarre sexual fever  dream . . . without giving away too much  i can say that fans of exceptional cinema should not consider missing this film . as bizarre as it is   la bte  is doubtlessly also stunningly beautiful in style  settings and cinematography . the fever  dream  like atmosphere is present within  and out of dream  sequences . the forest estate and the imposing family mansion are magnificent settings  and the beautiful score and incredible cinematography build an overwhelming atmosphere for this grotesque tale . the very explicit sexuality ranges from erotic  elegant female nudity  ravishing actresses  to seriously demented and even somewhat disgusting  close  ups on horses  genitalia while having intercourse  . . .   in either case it is not likely to be forgotten . the entire cast of  la bte  is fantastic and all involved deliver great performances in eccentric characters  some of which are seriously demented  . the film profits from an exceptionally beautiful cast  be it lisbeth hummel in the lead  finnish actress sirpa lane  who sadly died of aids in      as the ancestor in the dream  sequences  or the relatively unknown but particularly ravishing actress pascale rivault  who plays the aristocratic daughter who takes ever opportunity to have sex with a black servant in a cupboard .  br    br   i am intentionally not giving a full description of the most important parts of the plot as they simply have to be seen to be believed . some scenes are among the most bizarre ever caught on film  the scenes with the eponymous  beast  definitely being among them . certainly not everybody  s cup of tea  but very highly recommended to fans of controversial and unusual cinema . a true cult gem   ,1

  br    br   i have seen this movie many times . at least a dozen . but unfortunatly not recently . however  etched in my memory never to leave me is a scene in which mickey rooney    killer mears  knows that he is to be executed and it  s getting close to the moment of truth  he dances  and cries  and laughs  he vacillates from hesteria to euphoria and runs the gambit of ever emotion . never have i seen such a brilliant performance by any actor living or dead  past or present . it was then i know for sure that mickey rooney  yes   andy hardy  was and is a actor of great genius . however i kept it  my opinion to myself for years thinking  surely i must be alone in this viewpoint . about   years or so after i saw this film for the last time on television  i chanced to read the old q  a section of the los angeles times . the question was posed to lawrence olivier  and the question was  mr . olivier you are considered one of the greatest actors of all time  whom then do you consider to be among the greatest actors   his answer was   peter finch and mickey rooney  i was stunned  but not surprised . i immediatly flashed back to his  killer mears  and i felt very good for having seen this great ability in him  and now having my view supported by another whos work i admired . . later of course there was  bill  and many other great moments with mikey rooney . this film   the last mile  should be seen by all acting students . i frankly cannot remember a great deal about the film after all these years but mr . rooney in it  will never leave me . if anyone out there remembers this film the same as i do  i would be interested in hearing from you . for this picture etched in my heart alone i gave it a   just on the face of his performance .  ,1
i understand this movie was made on a very low budget but that is no excuse for the monstrosity that is grendel . deathstalker  the throne of fire  barbarian queen  conquest  the invincible barbarian were all done on shoestring budgets and poor special effects yet they still managed to create cult classics by adding some scantily clad women warriors and a good sense of humor . the primitive costumes  dark castles and beautiful bulgarian landscape gave grendel the potential to be a very good low budget sword and sorcery film  but the makers completely ruined this opportunity by using extremely poor cgi effects and colorless characters . compare this film to beowulf       . it may not be citizen kane but it is a good example of how an entertaining low budget sci  fi  adventure movie can be made by using credible special effects and appealing characters .  ,0
a warm  sweet and remarkably charming film about two antagonistic workers in the same shop  james stewart and margaret sullavan  who are carrying on a romance via mailbox without either of them knowing it . the key to this film  s success is that ernst lubitsch keeps any syrupy sentimentality absent and calls on his actors to give low  key  unfussy performances . as a result  you fall in love with virtually all of them .  br    br   there  s a strong undercurrent of melancholy running through this film which i appreciated . loneliness is a major theme  most obviously represented in the character of the shop  s owner and manager  played wonderfully by frank morgan . he discovers that he  s being cuckolded by his wife  and realizes that the successful life he  s created for himself isn  t enough to keep him from feeling lonely when he doesn  t have a partner to share it . this makes the timid romance between stewart and sullavan all the more poignant  because they  re both reaching out to this unseen other  who each thinks of as a soulmate before they  ve even met . of course we know everything will turn out right in the end  but the movie doesn  t let you forget the dismal feeling either of them would feel if they found that the reality didn  t live up to the fantasy .  br    br   lubitsch fills his movie out with a crackerjack cast that has boatloads of chemistry . the little group of shop employees refers to itself throughout the movie as a little family  and that  s exactly how it feels to us as well .  br    br   this is a wonderful  unsung romance .  br    br   grade a  ,1
how can anyone not love this movie  i think it  s a hilarious spoof of all the old gangster movies if you  ve never seen them  watch this instead . michael keaton has a ball in this role as anything goes . one guy mangles the english language everytime he talks and griffin dunn plays a clueless d . a .  but my favorite role has got to be joe piscopo . he has all the best lines . danny devito  alan hale  ray walston are in this star  studded movie that lampoons gangsters a lot funnier than  mafia  did for the criminal underground .  ,1
come on  let  s get real . the knights of christ  ordo templi  or the knights templar as they are more commonly called did not even exist until the early   th century . the story is so laughable that it  s pathetic . dolph lundgren just looked positively bored . and besides  if you wanted to have a real  life templar  why not just use the knights of christ  who are still in existence in portugal . at least they should have taken history into account . the only redeeming quality i could find in this movie was that the artifacts looked authentic enough to pass for medieval or gothic period pieces . the acting was bad  the storyline appalling  the action horrible  and the props were okay .  ,0
went to see this movie with my brother and his girlfriend . the place was pretty packed and we all laughed so hard it was easy to miss lines . i knew it looked like it would be good but it was much funnier than i thought it would be . i liked both edward furlong and christina ricci  they seemed really weird just like normal people  if that makes sense . i get sick of movies that show teenagers as being like cookie cutter people  like  jock  or  geek  or  cheerleader  . . . etc . both characters were unique but still very human and normal enough to relate to . i will be recommending this movie to all my friends and waiting very eagerly for it to be out on dvd  go see this movie with your friends who can laugh at the funniest parts of life  i plan to see it again in the theater and i don  t go see things more than once very often .  ,1
malefique pretty much has the viewer from start to finish with its edgy atmosphere . nearly the whole movie is set in a prison cell revolving around  characters of which transvestite marcus and his little retarded boy are way out the strangest . soon the inmates find a diary of a previous inmate behind a brick which deals with his obsession of occult and black magic themes leading to his escape from the cell . from here on everything deals with uncovering the secret of the book and its spells to flee from prison . that leads to some accidents on the way out of the cell into the unknown light .  br    br   honestly i think the story is rather poor and the final twist is nice but to me the ends are pretty loosely tied together . anyway i was thrilled until the last moment because the atmosphere of the movie is unique with minimal setting and cast . the kills are raw and eerie . . . its doesn  t take gore to chill your spine and the occult themes are also done very well and reminded me of the hell themes in hellraiser . malefique has a claustrophobic and cold dirty feel with greenish tint . at times you wonder if the real or the occult world depicted here is stranger . . . when the retarded boy looses his fingers and is lulled to sleep sucking on marcus breasts it seems normal  so how strange can glowing gates to freedom be  with its budget the movie creates a unique atmosphere and chills the viewer in a very different way than most of the genre shockers do . i just wish the story had led to a more consistent finale . several elements like the visitor with the camera  the other inmates obsession with books and the toy doll vaguely pointing to the end don  t fit tight in the story . anyway  i  ll keep my eyes open for other movies from director valette  although its a turn  off to see he  s is doing a hollywood remake of  one missed call  which was worn off and useless already in the miike  version .  ,1
the original is a relaxing watch  with some truly memorable animated sequences . unfortunately  the sequel  while not the worst of the dtv sequels completely lacks the sparkle .  br    br   the biggest letdown is a lack of a story . like belle  s magical world  the characters are told through a series of vignettes . magical world  while marginally better  still manages to make a mess of the story . in between the vignettes  we see the mice at work  and i personally think the antics of jaq and gus are the redeeming merits of this movie .  br    br   the first vignette is the best  about cinderella getting used to being to being a princess . this is the best  because the mice were at their funniest here . the worst of the vignettes  when jaq turns into a human  is cute at times  but has a lack of imagination . the last vignette  when anastasia falls in love  was also cute . the problem was  i couldn  t imagine anastasia being friendly with cinderella  as i considered her the meaner out of the stepsisters . this was also marred by a rather ridiculous subplot about lucifer falling in love with pompom .  br    br   the incidental music was very pleasant to listen tohowever i hated the songs  they were really uninspired  and nothing like the beautiful tchaikovsky inspired melodies of the original .  br    br   the characters were the strongest development here . cinderella while still caring  had lost her sincerity  and a lot of her charm from the original  though she does wear some very pretty clothes . the duke had some truly funny moments but they weren  t enough to save the film  likewise with prudence and the king . as i mentioned  the mice were the redeeming merits of the movie  as they alone contributed to the film  s cuteness . i have to say also the animation is colourful and above average  and the voice acting was surprisingly good .  br    br   all in all  a cute  if unoriginal sequel  that was marred by the songs and a lack of a story .     for the mice  the voice acting  the animation and some pretty dresses . bethany cox  ,0
turkish cinema has a big problem . directors aren  t interested in global cinema . they are local and folkloric  but want to be international . this brings kitsch results such this movie .  br    br   film has jokes translated to spanish from turkish and they don  t have any meaning for non  turkish audiences . even for turkish audiences after   years .  br    br   players  even ferhan sensoy have a worse acting than average . they act like puppets .  br    br   movie was shot in cuba  but nothing includes about cuba . so cuba is thought like a banana republic .  br    br   waste of money  waste of time .  ,0
these guys are anything but the usual suspects  they are a total bunch of likeable oddballs who you want to see get away with it  but they are so hapless that there is very little chance of that . no one is better than william h macy at portraying the man with a big heart but down on his luck . this is probably his best performance since fargo . sam rockwell played the meathead boxer to perfection  and the rest of the gang were uniformly good also . luis guzman brought some great comic relief as cosimo  and george clooney stole every scene in his cameo role . the heist scene at the end was absolutely hilarious .  br    br   the direction was also spot on by the russo brothers . there was certainly a coen brothers feel to the film throughout and it will be interesting to see how they will develop their careers . they have a long way to go to match the coen  s but this is an excellent start and i look forward to their next celluloid outing . . . . . . . .  yo mutha  s a whore    ,1
in all of low budget history . this movie has to be one of the worst . true ther are some humorous sides to the movie  but in general it was just plain awful . i just can  t understand what person could not out run a bunch of slugs . i mean they have to be one of the slowest creatures on the planet . the only part worth while in this movie is the close up of a slugs attempt to bite the finger of a man . this was rather amusing .  ,0
edward montagne  s tattooed stranger is supposed to play like a crime thriller with a little film noir mixed in for flavor . instead  it  s a poorly acted  witless look into low budget and uninspired film making . the plot is absurd and the acting excruciatingly stiff and amateurish . john miles  who had a rather thin resume in the industry  grins and guffaws throughout  and everyone else acts with the same verve as characters in a government  made filmstrip about driver safety . the movie anticipates shows like  leave it to beaver  and  father knows best  in its unnaturally wholesome view of new york in     . why  the viewer doesn  t even get to see anyone light up a cig until some shapely woman is interviewed in a flophouse halfway through the movie . the only thing the movie has going for it  besides its brevity  is the excellent location shots coordinated by william steiner . the low budget of the film works in the cinematographer  s favor  as the viewer is treated to well  framed shots of new york city  s interiors and expansive exteriors . unless you wish to enjoy the film for the choice of settings and camera angles  i suggest watching practically any other movie .  ,0
perhaps the most gripping and intelligent of crooked cop movies is otto preminger  s  where the sidewalks ends   from a really excellent script by ben hecht based on the novel  night cry  by frank rosenberg . . .  br    br   dana andrews is the honest  tough new york policeman  always in trouble with his superiors because he likes his own strong  arm methods as much as he detests crooks . . . when he hit someone  his knuckles hurt . . . and the man he wants to hit is a smooth villain  gary merrill  who points up the title .  why are you always trying to push me in the gutter   he asks andrews .  i have as much right on the sidewalk as you .   br    br   dana andrew  s obsession and neurosis are implanted in his hidden  painful discovery that he is the son of a thief . . . his deep hatred of criminals led him to use their own illegal methods to destroy them  and the pursuit of justice became spoiled in private vendetta . . .  br    br   by a twist of irony unique to the film itself  dana andrews and gene tierney of  laura  are united once more  and andrews now seems to be playing the same detective a few years later  but no longer the romantic  beaten down by his job  by the cheap crooks . . . this time  he goes too far  and accidentally kills a suspect . . . the killing is accidental  the victim worthless  yet it is a crime that he knows can break him or send him to jail . . .  br    br   using his knowledge of police procedure  he covers up his part in the crime  plants false clues  and tries to implicate a gang leader  but cannot avoid investigating the case himself . . . the double tension of following the larger case through to its conclusion without implicating himself in the murder  is beautifully maintained and the final solution is both logical  satisfying  and in no way a compromise . . .  br    br   the film is one of the best detective films of the    s  with curious moral values  also one of preminger  s best . . .  br    br   preminger uses a powerful storytelling technique  projecting pretentious camera angles and peculiar touches of the bizarre in order to externalize his suspense in realism . . .  ,1
last year we were treated to two movies about truman capote writing the book from which this film was made  capote and infamous .  br    br   i cannot imagine a movie like this being made in     . a stark  powerful and chillingly brutal drama elevated to the status of a film classic by the masterful direction of richard brooks  elmer gantry  cat on a hot tin roof  the professional  blackboard jungle  .  br    br   it is interesting that robert blake  who starred in this film  has had so many problems of late that may be related to his portrayal of a killer in this film .  br    br   this is a film that stays with you after viewing .  ,1
posh spice victoria beckham and her alleged new adventures after just moving to la for work purposes  footballer hubby david is now a galaxy la player after his transfer from real madrid  was originally going to be a full series  but was thankfully abridged to just one hour or so . but even in this form  it is still numbingly interminable .  br    br   like virtually all  reality  tv shows  most of the incident comes across as blatantly faked  with the programme itself even admitting that posh  s newly appointed personal assistant is an actress . an ugly  betty lookalike  we hear some lamely written and performed banter early on  with an obvious joke about becks  apparent dalliance with a previous  and rather more glamorous pa rebecca loos  though her name is not mentioned  with further sequences involving a fake blow  up doll to trick the paparazzi and hopeless attempts to pitch a baseball .  br    br   this could have been more entertaining if all had acknowledged it was a piece of fluff  and had an actress or impersonator in the lead role . talented impressionist ronni ancona would  ve been perfect and is better at being posh than posh herself is  and if this more sensible decision had been taken  much more fun and amusement would  ve ensued . sadly  we are left with the real thing here  ms ancona may have rejected the script as too weak anyway   and although there are odd scattered attempts at self  deprecation and irony  it never remotely works because of prior info of la beckham  s considerable wealth beforehand  and her non  ability at delivering would  be jokesdespite the intentions to send up her image  mrs beckham comes across as a shallow egotist  and her weak one  liners don  t persuade us she has any humorous self  awareness . i suspect that if a more realistic fly  on  the  wall documentary approach had been taken  namely posh walking down any street in la and being totally ignored  instead of the frantic  staged scenes of mild hysteria on show here   and associates making unscripted jibes about the previously mentioned ms loos  this would  ve made marginally better tv  but being sycophantic pr material  the bony one herself would never allow such events to happen .  br    br   having said that  the later scenes where she made a special appearance at the baseball stadium where she was indifferently presented in front of an uninterested crowd show it will be tough times ahead if she wants to make it big in hollywood . her colleague scary spice  aka mel brown  also found it impossible to make it big residing in the movie capital despite her affair  which was not consummated  with big name eddie murphy .  br    br   the spice girls were of course a massively successful bubblegum pop group in the mid      s  more so in their native britain but still popular briefly in other countries  including the us . they were certainly good fun at their peak of glory       when there seemed to be a glorious period of optimism in the uk with cool britannia and a new labour government which the spice girls seemed to sum up better then anyone else at the time  even if it was somewhat manufactured . but they were never outstanding musical or singing talents  and uk optimism seemed to fade rapidly later that year  the starting point was arguably the tragic death of princess diana   as did the spices  themselves . their presence on the music and entertainment scene soon became repetitive and obvious  and if they had all quietly moved out of the public eye permanently with dignity to enjoy their fortunes  then we would have all had pleasant memories encrypted on our mind without any guilt . unfortunately  the emergence of the hideous  celebrity  culture in the uk towards the start of the millennium has put paid to those imaginings  and we have all suffered thousands  if not millions of stories about the spices since  posh being the worst offender  with the rest of her colleagues not too far behind . it was recently announced that there will be a reunion tour soon  which is baffling as they have never gone away and they certainly don  t require any additions to their swelling bank accounts . maybe it  s because two of them are struggling single mothers  perhaps   br    br   good  it  s soon time for becks  adventures on a revelatory documentary next  i can hardly wait . . . . . . . . . . . . .  br    br   rating  out of   .  ,0
i really enjoyed this movie . i am a single dad with a   year old daughter who is smart  athletic and talented . i wish my girl applied herself so well to solving crimes and helping others  so for me  perhaps this is pg level fantasyland . i read many nancy drew books in my teen years  long  long ago . sure this character was ably played by emma roberts but did not resemble the nancy drew i recall from the books . that is due to script  not the acting .  br    br   emma is an adorable teen  playing a self  confident  industrious and proud character with good manners and good taste . she is not caught up in the trendy competitiveness around her . there are some weaknesses in the plot  aside from not resembling the nancy drew of the books  and trying to figure out what decade we  re in .  like  what is that car  anyway    br    br   i read the imdb overview before seeing the film  as i was researching rachael leigh cook from other movies . this is not one of her best roles  but i will continue looking for more of her films . rachael was too old to play this lead  but does a fine job as the grown  up orphan central to the mystery .  br    br   i am very disappointed in other reviews written here . some expect perfect connection with the books  some expect more credible situations or adult action film . i got what i expected  good entertainment well targeted to young teen girls  and their fathers who want good kids with high standards of conduct and achievement . this is a teen pg movie  not james bond  which would you want for a role model for your teenaged daughter   ,1
the story at the outset is interesting slavery in the  late    th century from west africa to the arab middle east . the problem with it is that it intentionally castigates two of director richard fleisher  s favorite enemies arabs and germans . to make us believe that very arab  looking men would be free to roam around and easily catch blacks in west africa is as believable as whites hunting for slaves in  roots  . obviously both trades are  were run by locals and involve  d  much more sophisticated networks . while arab countries are complicit in today  s child and sex slave trade  israel is one of the worst violators according to amnesty international . so why only point out arabs and then choose a german as the only european buyer  it  s obvious bias and hatred of those people by a jewish director .  br    br   the acting is above average  especially by peter ustinov  suleiman  and kabir bedi  malik  . michael caine  dr . linderby  is good as always .  ,0
interesting how much more realistic brosnan  s performance is to that of the original james bond novels when compared to the bond films . he  s neurotic  paranoid  an alcoholic and a womanizer to boot . this is perfect break for him  even so much as to make fun of the bond icon .  i  m a mess  a parody of myself  he says . it doesn  t get any better than that . i just finished reading dr . no and this is very much how ian fleming had portrayed james bond . personally i never liked brosnan as bond because he fit the icon too closely . there was nothing for him to personalize the character with  as compared to roger moore or sean connery . its great to see brosnan play a character both grounded in reality and flamboyantly off the wall . a shallow character trying to come to an understanding on deeper emotional and psychological issues to which he has no background dealing with . it  s an impressive portrayal  and having greg kinear to ground him  is just poetic . this movie reminds me a little bit of dynamics established between the main characters in  my blue heaven   but more genuine in their coping mechanisms .  ,1
the cat and mouse are involved in the usual chases when jerry dives into a bottle of invisible ink and discovers that it makes him vanish . instead of seizing the opportunity to go spy on a girl mouse changing room or something  he uses his new  found invisibility to torment tom . and it  s pretty funny and quite inventive despite being a somewhat one  joke cartoon . and the action never leaves the interior of the house  which is usually the trait of below average tj shorts . still worth a     .  br    br   however  i  m not sure how an invisible mouse can cast a shadow on the wall  it defies physics and the very nature of being invisible itself .  ,1
deathtrap runs like a play within a movie about who did what to whom  as it primarily takes place on one set . the premise is that an accomplished playwright  whose star is falling  receives a magnificent manuscript from a former student and so he plans to off his protege and appropriate his play  to the  loud  protests of his wife . or so you think  for the first half of the movie . past the halfway mark  deathtrap begins to throw in twists and surprises that turn its premise on its head  then right around  and then in a mad spin  all the time keeping its title appropriate . it  s an excellent mystery movie soaked in wit .  br    br   michael caine  as the senior playwright  plays himself in this movie  a slightly loony and very dramatic brit . no surprises here  he does his usual good work . he gets the best line of deathtrap  which he executes perfectly  what is your definition of success  being gang  banged in a state penitentiary    br    br   christopher reeve  on the other hand  juggles comedy and drama in a surprisingly strong performance playing the ambitious  and psychopathic  young playwright . he also gets to show off his very toned body  which he must  ve retained coming off the superman movies .  br    br   caine and reeve have collaborated in another movie that  s one of my favorite comedies  noises off . it similarly revolves around a play as well  although this time caine is the director and reeve is an actor . they are joined by comic veterans carol burnett  john ritter  marilu henner  taxi  and mark linn  baker  perfect strangers  . together  they demonstrate the calamities that befall the bed  hopping cast and crew of a play . on the surface  the movie looks to be mostly slapstick but upon watching you find that they are many subtle jokes that require more than one viewing to catch . wish this underrated movie was available on dvd .  ,1
i  d give this a negative rating if i could . i went into this movie not expecting much  but i had an open mind . the whole thing is stupid  the snakes are obviously fake and the first two things they bite are a boob and a guys johnson . oh how original if i were a   year old boy i might laugh at that . i have no idea how this movie became so popular . seriously  the worst thing i  ve ever seen . i wasn  t entertained  it wasn  t funny  i wasn  t even bored  i wasn  t anything . it wasn  t even so bad it was good  it  s just bad . ridiculous actually . please do not waste your money on this movie . don  t even rent this movie . no clue how it  s getting such a high rating .  ,0

ah yez  the sci fi channel produces yeti another abominable movie . i was particularly taken by the scenes immediately following the crash where  as the survivors desperately searched for matches  at least a half dozen fires burned  with no apparent reason  at various points of the wreckage . fire seemed to be a predominate theme throughout . they searched corpses for lighters and matches  and finally finding a box built a fire every day for  apparently     but no one ever gathered wood . then when the vegan  hah  burned the bodies  what did she use for an accelerant  i mean these guys were frozen  well maybe not . despite the apparent low temperature everything the yeti ate  bled . maybe it  s just me  but even in a totally unbelievable tale  none of the survivors had ever heard of a yeti  or an abominable snowman  until the very end   if you take care of the little things the bigger deals become more acceptable . oh  what did the prologue       have to do with the remainder of the movie  and the revolver  warm enough to hold in his hand  froze up and wouldn  t fire . gimme a break . well  at least we have carly pope  another eminently lovely canadian lass . and  with little irony  ed marinaro as the coach .  br    br   well i might as well add  the rabbit they ate  despite it looking like chicken  is not a rodent  but a lagomorph . now if it had been a squirrel  or a rat  it would have been a rodent  but it still looked like chicken . and the writers missed a real chance to have someone note  it tastes just like . . .   ,0
this kiyoshi kurosawa ghost movie is pretty wild  and it did have at least one jump scare that caught me off guard . but all in all  the movie is incredibly stupid  with a detective trying to track down a suspected serial killer  only to find out he may have committed one of the crimes . then he finds himself haunted by a gorgeous asian lady ghost  and has no idea why  and neither does the viewer  . as other murders are committed  he becomes even more confused as the killers are easily found  and this ghost still haunts him for some reason . not only is the plot completely stupid  the lady ghost is more funny than anything  especially when she suddenly flies across the city  like wonder woman . and the ending makes little sense  in fact  the whole movie makes little sense  and i can  t recommend it at all . if it didn  t take itself so serious  i would think it was supposed to be a black comedy . outside of  bright future  this is the worst movie directed by kiyoshi kurosawa i have seen yet .  ,0
whereas the hard  boiled detective stories of dashiell hammett and raymond chandler have fitted to cinema like a fox in a chicken coop  indeed creating the definitively modern american genre and style in the process  those of what might be called golden age fiction have made barely any impression whatsoever . the problem with books like those of agatha christie  dorothy l . sayers or s . s . van dine  on whose work this film is based   is that they are low on action or variety  whereas sam spade or philip marlowe traverse the mean streets of la  working class tenements  bars  offices  wealthy mansions  and meet all sorts of exciting dangers and violence  golden age fiction is generally fixed in location  the scene of the murder  usually a lavish country house  and the action is limited to investigating clues and interviewing suspects . this is a very static procedure  plot reduced to puzzle .  br    br   this  of course  is as much ideological as anything else  the golden age stories dealing with a society hostile to change and movement the hard  boiled novels recording an urban reality increasingly moving away from a centre  both of authority  and of a city   dividing itself up into hostile  ever uncontrollable and lawless camps . another major problem with golden age fiction is character  because we cannot know the answer to the crime until the end  we cannot gain access to characters  motivations or emotions  being defined solely by their potential need to murder . the detective  unlike the anxious  prejudice  ridden private eyes  are simply there to be brilliant  and maybe a little eccentric .  br    br   the problem with most films from golden age books is that they try to be period recreations of the merchant ivory  jane austen school  and end up looking silly . there have been successes  for example the radical reworkings of ellery queen and others by claude chabrol . in the english  speaking world  there have really only been two . the alistair sim classic   green for danger   works because it pushes the form almost into parody  while never betraying the integrity or interest of the mystery .  br    br   before that came michael curtiz  s brilliant  the kennel murder case  . the narrative is pure golden age . a repulsive character is introduced who gives a number of potential suspects reason to kill him . he is duly murdered in a seemingly foolproof manner  indicating suicide  slumped in a locked room . the caricatured policemen fall hopelessly for the bait . it is up to philo vance  gentleman and amateur detective  neither old nor fat  to read the clues more insightfully  open the case out of the confines of the room  and eventually solve the case  the corpse being little more than the pretext for intellectual stimulation .  br    br   what is interesting is not this detective plot  which can only ever be unsatisfying as all solutions are  although it is rarely less than entertaining  and full of comical bits of business . there isn  t even really an attempt to  subvert  the image of the perfect detective  there is one alarming scene where a brutal sergeant threatens to rough up a suspect  with no protest from vance  but that  s about it .  br    br   what marks  kennel  as a classic is its modernity . curtiz is not generally considered a great auteur  because he has no consistent themes or evidence of artistic development . but he was hollywood  s greatest craftsman  and he is on sensational form here . if the golden age detective story is mere puzzle  curtiz takes this idea to is logical extreme  creating an abstract variation on his source  reducing narrative  character and location to geometry  a series of lines  from the beautiful art  deco sets to the glorious camera movements which suddenly break from a static composition  and  as they glide furiously at an angle  jolt the dead decor to life .  br    br   this treatment is appropriate to a story that resolutely refuses realism  it is a pattern that turns the detective plot into a hall of mirrors  like the two central brothers  or the original crime itself  borrowed from an  unsolved mysteries  book . this fantasy world of nasty rich men who collect oriental relics  shades of  the moonstone     inscrutable chinese servants  ex  cons turned butlers  dog  loving fops  runyonesque cops  is the perfect habitat for vance  a man who will drop a cruise to europe on a fanciful hunch  who knows the social world of these people  and yet is tainted by his interest in crime and association with the police  or would be if he wasn  t anything more than a thinking machine  william powell  the greatest american comedian of the decade  bravely subsuming his idiosyncratic humanity .  br    br   but if the treatment is rarefied  the climax is spectacularly brutal  involving vicious dogs and attempted murder . the police and the detective  supposed to be preventing crime  are guilty of inciting one .  ,1
ok first of all  this movie sucks . but lets examine why . the proposition that a machine is capable of transforming matter into energy  storing it  and then transporting it and reasembling it is at the least intriguing . but that  s as far as they take this premise . instead of delving into what could happen if someone made this kind of machine  they break the damn thing . this could have been a good premise . living with the responsibilty of this kind of power  and dealing with the constant temptation  ie . . the invisible man . but no . . they break the damn thing . and lembach wants to leave . so then the doctor jerry  rigs the thing back together  and trys to transport himself . only to have it goofed up by his beautiful but dumb secretary   duh  . which wouldn  t happened if lembach hadn  t decided to leave . so now he is roaming the country side killing people because his little experiment failed  and they wouldn  t give him money . wah . then to make the movie worse  throw in a dry british relationship between the two semi  competent professors hired to assist him . between their loving sessions  they make a couple of half  hearted attempts to find him while he kills off half of london . all of this could have been headed off by not breaking the damn machine  which would never have happened if lembach hadn  t left . this movie tried so i give it an honest  stars for effort  but it would have been better if they hadn  t broke the damn machine  making lembach leave  making him try it again . damn you lembach                  ,0
when many people say it  s the  worst movie i  ve ever seen   they tend to say that about virtually any movie they didn  t like . however  of the nearly    movies i can remember ever seeing this one is one of two that i walked away from feeling personally insulted and angry . this is my first movie review  by the way  and i registered with imdb just to rave at this movie  s badness . i went to see it when it was in the theaters  myself and my two buddies were  of  people there   and after   years i can  t remember very many specifics  but my attitude upon leaving the theater is still crystal clear .  br    br      spoiler alert     br    br   oh my  where to begin . fat loser left at altar  goes on ski weekend  meets blonde bombshell who takes an interest in him  takes him home to meet the family  they  re all cannibals and he  s the main course  pathetic attempt at a dramatic escape  kicks all their butts and runs off with the brother  s girlfriend  they live happily ever after . puke . firstly  the gags are so bad that it took me a while to understand that they were trying to be funny  and that this was a comedy . the special effects  what few there are  look like they were done   years earlier . the big dramatic ending was so hokey and poorly acted that it was nearly unbearable to watch  he knocks out the entire cannibal family with rakes laying in the lawn  that stand up tom and jerry style when they step on them  . i  m sure that there  s much  much more  but i have no intention on seeing it again for a refresher .  ,0
it  s difficult to know where this adaptation starts going wrong  because i think the problem begins with the books themselves . alexander mccall smith has worked out that you read them not for the detective stories  but for his deeply condescending and completely spurious vision of an africa that does not exist . he  s done for botswana what borat did for kazakhstan  not as successfully  but based in as much fact .  br    br   once i realised this  it ceased to gall me that jill scott  an american singer  actress  is cast as mma ramotswe . if she is to represent a land that is not africa  how appropriate that she is a black woman who is not african  she  s not the only american on the cast mma makutsi is played by anika noni rose . both women are far  far too young for the roles they  re playing  and far too glamorous . both brutally murder the local accents  and both focus so entirely on this brutality that they fail to offer much in the way of acting . scott  s mma ramotswe is bouncy  cute and soft . rose  s mma makutsi is an annoying motor  mouthed bitch .  br    br   the result is almost unwatchable . the principal cast is redeemed only by the presence of lucian msamati  who turns in a decent performance as mr jlb matekoni . hes comes off smarter and more intense than in the books  but i find myself unable to blame msamati for this  he  s a shining light in an ocean of suckage . the contradictions between his performance and the books are clearly laid at the feet of whichever committee of butchers wrote the script .  br    br   to me  mccall smith  s writing has always been highly entertaining yet notoriously bad . he refuses to be edited . as a result  his books contain experiments in grammar that border on the scientific  and characters that change name mid  sentence . it is therefore something of an achievement that the writing team on this project actually made it worse .  br    br   the dialogue is now largely anglicised . characters speak of  opening up  and  sensitivity to needs  . mma ramotswe and mr jlb matekoni flirt openly . mma makutsi moans about not having a computer  but given her constantly restyled hair  makeup and jewellery  i  m surprised she doesn  t have a macbook in her handbag along with her visa card .  br    br   so what are we left with here  it  s difficult to be upset with this crappy adaptation because honestly  most of the things i like about the original books are apocryphal anyway . mccall smith paints a fictional botswana populated with cute  non  threatening black people who are full of amusing and palatable wisdom  nuggets . it reads well despite linguistic travesty  but it is a vision of how a certain type of white person wishes black people were . it just isn  t true .  br    br   given that  it  s hardly surprising that this show sucks as much as it does . it remains to be seen whether european and american audiences will even notice  however .  ,0
fully deserving its prestigious hollywood award nomination  this is an entertaining little gem with lots of pizazz and some delightful surprises . outstandingly funny scenes include an hilarious shoot  and re  shoot  of a ww  trench scene with australian comedian clyde cook as an optimistic non  com and the hapless mcdoakes as a boyer  colman messenger  all under the beady eye of ralph sanford  s delightfully irascible anguish a lost mcdoakes guided and re  guided by equally perplexed jack carson assistant director chandler rejoicing in a mcdoakes  sent opportunity  i  m going to be a director    br    br   ace comic o  hanlon has a dual role  playing both mcdoakes and himself playing mcdoakes  oddly  richard l . bare who does play himself in one or more other entries in the series  has turned down that opportunity here . in real life  bare  s a youngish  six  foot rock hudson lookalike  but here he  s impersonated by veteran actor  over    movies    jack mower .  ,1
although in my opinion this is one of the lesser musicals of stars frank sinatra  gene kelly  kathryn grayson and director george sidney  a lesser musical featuring anyone from that line  up is nothing to sneeze at  and in conjunction  the line  up makes anchors aweigh a pretty good film despite its flaws .  br    br   sinatra and kelly are clarence doolittle and joseph brady  respectively  two navy men . as the film begins  they  re just pulling in to the los angeles area for some much needed leave . brady plans on visiting a girlfriend named lola . doolittle is still a bit wet behind the ears  appropriately enough  and seeks advice on women from brady in private  publicly  scriptwriter isobel lennart and sidney have all of the navy men comically exaggerating their finesse with women to each other  . brady promises to help get doolittle hooked up  but primarily because doolittle won  t leave him alone otherwise . a kink is put into their plans when local police basically force them to assist with a young boy who is obsessed with the navy . he won  t give the police any information about who he is or where he lives . brady helps and he and doolittle end up taking the boy back home . when the boy  s guardian  susan abbott  grayson   finally shows up  doolittle goes gaga for her . brady tries to convince him to forget about her brady just wants to get back to lola . but they keep getting coaxed back to abbott  s home  and eventually something of a love triangle forms . things become more complicated when brady lies about doolittle knowing a famous musician  jose iturbi  who is in residence at a film studio  and claims that doolittle has set up an audition for abbott  who is a singer and actress  in front of iturbi .  br    br   because of the story  the music is a strange combination of militaristic music   because of the navy premise  obviously  broadway pop   what the stars tend to sing in more informal settings  opera   what abbott  s character excels at  liberace  like popular classical   what iturbi did  and mexican music   because abbott frequents a mexican restaurant in a mexican section of l . a . the combination doesn  t work as well as it could . plenty of the songs are good  and everyone involved is certainly talented as a singer or musician  but the genre hopping tends to lose coherence . worse  there are a couple showcases for iturbi  who was apparently a big star at the time  that effectively bring the plot to a halt and that seem more than a bit hokey at this point in time . i just watched another film that happened to have outstanding music  robert altman  s kansas city        but that misguidedly stopped the plot to periodically turn into a concert film . anchors aweigh takes a similar tactic . yes  this is a musical  but there  s a difference between songs that propel and are integral to the plot and concert showcases that seem like contractual obligation material .  br    br   there are also some plot problems . it  s not very well established why brady is so against doolittle  s pursuit of abbott . we can guess that brady thinks doolittle shouldn  t become involved with someone who has to take care of a kid  and who seems relatively  proper  and traditional  but on the other hand  brady can tell that doolittle doesn  t have the same womanizing disposition that brady admits of himself . abbott seems like a good fit for doolittle  and furthermore  lennart works hard to establish that brady just wants to get doolittle out of his hair and get on with meeting lola   it seems that brady  s character should be quickly pawning doolittle off on any candidate  whether she  s a good fit or not . this might seem like a minor detail  but it  s actually the hinge for about a third to half of the plot . the story also seems a bit drawn out . length is a problem . anchors aweigh  clocking in at roughly two hours and twenty minutes  should have been cut down by at least a half  hour .  br    br   the above surely sounds like i  m complaining about the film too much to justify an  . i just wanted to stress what i see as flaws  because the conventional wisdom on anchors aweigh is much closer to the idea that it has no flaws .  br    br   sinatra  kelly and grayson are certainly charismatic  separately and together . they turn in good  interesting performances . sinatra looks and acts much younger than his actual age of      while shooting . he plays an unusually nave  virginal character   completely different than most of the roles he would take later  and different than his public image as a crooner . for kelly  this was his breakthrough film  and rightfully so . his choreography is varied and impressive  as is his acting . grayson is charming  her performance is sophisticatedly understated  and she  s simply gorgeous . all of this helps override the flaws with the script and the drawn out pacing .  br    br   and there  s even a very interesting element that probably only arises because sidney was allowed to sprawl over a large variety of moods   the infamous kelly dance with jerry the mouse  of  tom and jerry  fame  in an extended fantasy sequence . this is one of the earliest examples of combining live action and animation  and it is extremely well done and enjoyable as long as you  re a fan of fantasy . the fantasy sequences tend to be the best of the film . matched in excellence to the dance with jerry the mouse is a long song and dance number featuring kelly and grayson  where brady is imagining abbott in a scene from a period film while he woos her  having to resort to acrobatic stunts to reach her physically as she stands on a high balcony .  br    br   as uneven and flawed as the film is  it is largely successful and entertaining to watch . fans of classic musicals certainly shouldn  t miss anchors aweigh  and neither should sinatra fans  who  ll get quite a kick out of his character .  ,1
a dog found in a local kennel is mated with satan and has a litter of puppies  one of which is given to a family who has just lost their previous dog to a hit  run . the puppy wants no time in making like donald trump and firing the mexican housekeeper  how festive . only the father suspects that this canine is more then he appears  the rest of the family loves the demonic pooch . so it  s up to dad to say the day .  br    br   this late    s made for tv horror flick has little going for it except a misplaced feeling of nostalgia . when i saw this as a kid i found it to be a tense nail  biter  but revisiting it as an adult i now realize that it  s merely lame  boring  and not really well  acted in the least bit .  br    br   my grade d  ,0
this isn  t the worst movie i  ve ever seen  but i really can  t recall when i  ve seen a worse one . i thought this would be about an aircraft accident investigation . what it really was is a soap opera  and a bad one at that . they overplayed the  conflict  card to the extreme . the first hour or so seems like a shouting match  with some implausible scenes thrown in .  br    br   possible spoiler  br    br   the    or  so minute  memorial  scene  with requisite black umbrellas and rain  to fictitious crash victims was lame  and i thought it would never end .  br    br   avoid this one at all costs  unless you revel in  conflict  .  br    br    ,0
this is a docudrama story on the lindy chamberlain case and a look at it  s impact on australian society . it especially looks at the problem of innuendo  gossip and expectation when dealing with real  life dramas .  br    br   one issue the story deals with is the way it is expected people will all give the same emotional response to similar situations . not everyone goes into wild melodramatic hysterics to every major crisis . just because the characters in the movies and on tv act in a certain way is no reason to expect real people to do so . this is especially apt for journalists and news editors who appear to be looking for the the big sob scene that will pull the ratings . it  s an issue that has to be constantly addressed .  br    br   the leads play the characters with depth  personality and sensitivity . and they are ably supported by a large cast all playing based  on  fact individuals . some viewers may be surprised to learn that many of the supporting cast in this story are people better known in australia as comic actors . it re  enforces my idea that comic actors make some of the best supports in dramas because with comedy they know how to establish quick impressions of individuals .  br    br    spoiler warning    br    br   i have to say something very personal here in that i am actually an ex  adventist who was a practicing member in australia at the time this incident occurred so i have a slightly different impression of the story than most . i think it is handled with amazing creativity and personality  and emotional heart . i think the best scene is the one where the couple are hounded by the new choppers . it captured the themes of the story brilliantly .  br    br   i once heard fred schepsi say in an interview that he told the actors to  play the best case for their character they could  . while this is especially apt for this story  i think it is also a general principle that should apply to all acting as well .  ,1
this timeless proverb reverberates in this movie and in my heart . so many years have i waited to see this eternal story  i was not ready  perhaps . it is possible that my sensibilities would not have appreciated its power . so i now gratefully welcome it into my soul with gladness .  br    br   my respect and admiration for paul muni has been long . his is now a legendary luminescence . but now i have finally discovered the priceless gifts of luise rainer  s splendid talents . oh  how many faces can speak as did hers  some have said that it was wrought from her silent years  and this well might have been but her speech  is eloquent enough when it is given a chance . she amply deserved her oscar .  br    br   this movie is in an epic in the most classical proportions . all parts equal  necessary and perfect . naysayers may walk away if they wish  but they would be shunning a storytelling which stays with one a lifetime .  br    br   the good earth enriches one in ways that one does not expect . but all will not come from it with the joy that i did . but i can only hope that this film will be remembered for many years .  br    br   do not prod me with mere technicalities regarding the race of the principal players . these are expectations of modern times when we are obsessed with utter perfection . but i dare a million score of newer films to tell pearl buck  s story with such poignancy  power  conviction and grace .  br    br   if any modern artist would dare to re  film this masterpiece  i warn them that they will never come close to the aromatic fragrance which still emanates from the core of this telling . time will not diminish this effort nor will progress improve upon its greatness .  ,1
visually speaking  this film is stunning . it has some delightful black comedic moments . but on the whole  the plot is very clichd  as is its seeming message . if you  re a fan of over  the  top violence in mainstream movies like hostel or saw  you  ll love it . if you  re looking for something at all high  brow  steer away . i saw it as part of the edinburgh film festival    and i only chose it because i was looking for something disturbing . ultimately  it isn  t disturbing . just grinding and unpleasant to sit through . if you genuinely want to be challenged  go see something like the lost . if you want to be grossed out  or tell your friends about a really messed up film  then this is for you .  ,0
as with most of eleanor powell  s films  this one plays out along the flimsiest of plots . for some reason   oh it is explained    she  s selected to transport a magnetic mine to cuba . good guys and bad guys compete for the mine and who is who gets confusing . but  as always  powell  s dancing is superb and worth the price of admission . and in this one lahr plays his cowardly lion  evoking warm memories of that technicolor film of     . a fringe benefit is hearing a young frank  with that wonderful voice and skinny vulnerability that he abandoned for his wise  guy persona later on . in addition  the great drummer  buddy rich  has a wonderful time displaying his virtuosity . watch particularly for his unique duet with dorsey  s trumpet man  ziggy elman . i say  unique  perhaps in ignorance  but i know of no other drum  trumpet sequence like this one on film or records . this film is fun . even skelton  s goofy persona is relatively restrained . powell shows again that she is the greatest film dancer ever .  ,1
one thing is for sure . . . you should not watch this film if you are having a bad day . the story is based around a sad event and follows a character who has to live with a sin that he cant handle . the story is drip fed to you rather than the usual dumbed down explanation so it keeps you wondering what is going on . eventually the dots are joined up and the performances make sense . all the characters were ok and wil smith did another good day at the office .  br    br   there are no doubt a lot of moral questions to be asked but if you just accept and buy into his agony then it is easier to accept what he has chosen to do . whether you agree or disagree is irrelevant . the journey it takes you on is interesting enough  if not overwhelming .  br    br   a good enough film that unfortunately leaves you a little sad at the end . i would recommend this film if you like the sort where you have to think and not just watch explosions and fights .  ,1
i happened to catch this movie on cable one afternoon . i have to admit that i  ve never been a big baseball fan  but i can sometimes get into a good sports  related movie . what i found more interesting was the depiction of the foster family system . as a therapist who has seen both the good and the bad of the community mental health and foster system  i though it was rather refreshing to see a movie that showed both the ups and downs of this system people jumping from family to family  biological parents not always taking an active involvement  and transitions that can be but heart  wrenching and heart  melting . joseph gordon  levitt and danny glover are the anchor of this film  and both bring very believable performances . maybe it was just my emotional state  but i did find myself shedding a tear at the end of the film .  ,1
put the camera on me is a deceptively cute film . it is actually a complex glimpse at the psychology of children and offers interesting insights into the development of adults and an artist . on the surface this is a nostalgic look at some home movies made in the    s by a group of upper class neighborhood kids . one of the film  s directors  darren stein  had access to a video camera and quickly took over as the artistic leader for all of the movies . sure  these are just some cute kids having fun . but  this is also much more . this is a look into some moments in time as children grapple with a number of confusing issues that all of us face in life    fear  sexual awakening  unrequited love  loneliness and just trying to make sense of the adult world which seems to explode all around us . as we get older we tend to forget how overwhlelming the realities of life were when we were little .  br    br   what makes this film all the more valid is to watch a young darren stein turn into a little general of a filmmaker . it is clear that darren is running this show and these little movies are his vision but they are all informed by his friends  their problems  the interpersonal dynamics and the general confusion regarding the horrors of adult life . a lot of children make home movies  but i  ve never heard of or seen children create  little  movies about the holocaust  homosexuality  nuclear war and the inability to fit in and make friends . these kids are confronting and dealing with some heavy stuff   br    br   the power of this film is the way stein and shell pull various scenes together so tightly with running interviews with the kids    all now adults and all still friends . this adds a new angle to the film . how many of us have stayed in touch with our childhood friends  these guys have . and  many of the issues with which they were dealing are still running between them two decades later .  br    br   among the conflicts   a confession of a crush reveals a heart still broken  a very normal childhood sexual experience continues to be a  sticky  subject between two of the men  some ongoing resentments over the dynamics of relationships and there is still a member of this team who remains very much in charge and in center stage  which makes perfect sense as one watches these home movies progress over the course of a couple of years . darren stein is a director . no doubt about it .  br    br   stein and shell take turns chatting with each other from time to time and one can  t help but imagine the awkwardness of allowing us to peek into the young lives of these people . this is particularly true for stein who has gone on to a great deal of success in the entertainment industry as a film producer  writer and director . from the first moment of put the camera on me we can see the emergence of a gay little boy trying to figure it all out . we also see sides of the artistic mind and personality that are not always  nice  or  caring     and  this is a bold move for any artist to share with an audience .  br    br   there are so many revealing moments  but the most disturbing and complex moments involve a movie in which we see a jewish concentration camp victim being tortured and killed by a nazi . we discover thru interviews and narration that the nazi is played by a jewish child and the part of the victim is played by a gentile child . it is a painfully disturbing moment that glimpses into the darker side of fear and the way children work thru the horrors of the adult world that are beyond adult understanding much less that of a child .  br    br   this is much more than some home movies . this documentary captures the pain  beauty  joy and sadness of growing up . powerful stuff    and well worth seeing   br    br     ,1

damon runyon  s world of times square  in new york  prior to its disneyfication  is the basis for this musical . joseph l . mankiewicz  a man who knew about movies  directed this nostalgic tribute to the  crossroads of the world  that show us that underside of new york of the past . frank loesser  s music sounds great . we watch a magnificent cast of characters that were typical of the area . people at the edges of society tended to gravitate toward that area because of the lights  the action  the possibilities in that part of town . this underbelly of the city made a living out of the street life that was so intense .  br    br   some of the songs from the original production were not included in the film . we don  t know whether this makes sense  but this is not unusual for a hollywood musical to change and alter what worked on the stage . that original cast included the wonderful vivian blaine and stubby kaye  and we wonder about the decision of not letting robert alda  sam levene  isabel bigley repeat their original roles . these were distinguished actors that could have made an amazing contribution .  br    br   the film  visually  is amazing . the look follows closely the fashions of the times . as far as the casting of marlon brando  otherwise not known for his singing abilities  frank sinatra and jean simmons  seem to work in the film . sky masterson is  after all  a man  s man  who would look otherwise sissy if he presented a different  look  . frank sinatra is good as nathan detroit . jean simmons  as sarah brown  does a nice job portraying the woman from the salvation army who suddenly finds fulfillment with the same kind of man she is trying to save .  br    br   vivian blaine is a delight . she never ceases to amaze as miss adelaide  a woman with a heart of gold who  s nathan detroit  s love interest . ms . blaine makes a fantastic impression as the show girl who is wiser than she lets out to be . stubby kaye makes a wonderful job out of reprising his nicely nicely johnson .  br    br   the wonderful production owes a lot to the talented abe burrows  who made the adaptation to the screen . the costumes by irene sharaff set the right tone .  ,1
i watched this movie at   o clock in the morning  a time in the day where i am usually very open when it comes to movies . but still i think it wasn  t good  this movie wasn  t good at all . the reasons why are many .  br    br   the acting isn  t all that good  and time after time situations occurring in it reminded me of a poor    s chevy chase comedy . i mean  come on  like the handcuff situation  and the poker situation amongst the servants . . . this movie was so obviously based very much on the first one  and thats ok . but if i hadn  t seen the first one before seeing this  it would have sucked even worse . like the ending  it came very suddenly  and i felt like i got no closure what so ever . . . sebastian changed very suddenly  and this this movie seems like it was made solely to explain nr   and like no time or effort was used on making anything else good . the score is the same as in the first one  and it didn  t feel like a movie at all . . .  br    br   they should have handled the situations with more style and class  but they didn  t  and therefore  this movie turned out bad . . .  ,0

going into see seven pounds i wasn  t clearly sure what to think because the previews left to much open to grasp what the movie was really about . so within the first   min or so you are completely lost in the plot  have no idea what is going on and you think tim  who claims to be ben  is just a big asshole . all of this comes to an end when the  twist   so to speak  is unraveled at the very last minute of the movie . basically tim  will smith  was troubled and haunted by a big accident he made causing the end of seven peoples lives . by this he decides to scope out seven new people who are in need of help badly who he in turns gives his life to .  br    br   the acting of this film is great  as i feel will smith no matter what part he seems to impress . rosario dawson  to me  this is one of her better movies  aside from eagle eye which i think is up there to . she has been in some bad some good but she does deliver in this film . other actors  such as woody harrelson  have very small roles and not a big enough role to grasp the character . although the casting of the film was still good .  br    br   this movie was definitely not what i expected and certainly a lot slower pace in which i hoped . the movie  however  was still pretty good . nothing is revealed until the last  min of the movie and everything falls into place . up until then it just seems like a pointless love story . final thought seven poundsseven stars .  ,1

walt disney  s cinderella takes a story everybody  s familiar with and embellishes it with humor and suspense  while retaining the tale  s essential charm . disney  s artists provide the film with an appealing storybook look that emanates delectable fairy tale atmosphere . it is beautifully  if conventionally  animated the highlight being the captivating scene where the fairy godmother transforms a pumpkin into a majestic coach and cinderella  s rags to a gorgeous gown . mack david  al hoffman  and jerry livingston provide lovely songs like  a dream is a wish your heart makes  and  bibbidi  bobbidi  boo  that enhance both the scenario and the characters .  br    br   even though cinderella  s story is predictable  it provides such thrilling melodrama that one shares the concerns and anxieties of the titular heroine and her animal friends . both the wicked stepmother and her dreadful cat lucifer present a formidable menace that threatens the dreams and aspirations of cinderella and the mice . it is this menace that provides the story with a strong conflict that holds the viewers  interest . the film  s suspense  however  is nicely balanced by a serene sweetness  especially in the musical numbers . it is in these segments that reveal the appealing personalities of cinderella and her friends  moving the viewers to care for them . overall  walt disney  s cinderella is wonderful family entertainment that has held up remarkably well after half a century .  ,1
and a few more  no  s on top of that . voodoo academy is  without a doubt  the least ambitious film of all time . what exactly is it trying to do  tell a story  obviously not as has been pointed out  most of it  s just barely  legal guys rubbing themselves . could it  then  be an attempt at subversive homoeroticism  well  maybe  if not for the fact it never ever ever goes beyond the most innocuous and nonthreatening forms of male contact .  which is  to the delight of none  repeated about eighty thousand times .  well  it is sort of a horror movie is it trying to scare us  not unless the director meant to do so through the utter tedium and vacuousness of his  work .   br    br   never in my life have i enjoyed a movie less . this is the most boring and unnecessary thing i  ve ever seen . it  s like voodoo academy takes the genres of horror  zombie  and gay movies  puts them in a grinder  then runs them through a coffee filter   only instead of it being the kind of coffee filter that filters out coffee beans  it  s the kind that takes out everything vital  edgy  or in any way interesting . the result is   minutes of film every bit as exciting as a glass of warm water   only without the ability to rehydrate you after the    day gin binge that will inevitably befall you if you watch this abomination of human effort .  ,0
it  s interesting to see what the director tried to do with this film . but the problem is that it  s not very good . there was nothing really original in the film and while the plot was well presented  the main characters were all a bit to shallow and you didn  t bother for any of them .  br    br   rather bland  and sometimes downright bad  photo leaves a bit to be desired but i guess you can  t expect to much from people who are just doing a low budget film for the heck of it . it  s unfair to review the film and compare it to other high  budget films . but alas  that is what one must do . on its own  it  s not very good . and compared to others  it  s still not very good . but it is not without its good points  i liked the plot . it was built up rather nicely and tied together well at the end . sometimes in the really dark scenes  it managed to build up a creepy feeling as well .  br    br   however in the end the film fails to impress . the characters are pretty much non  existent and we don  t care for any of them . any of them might die  but it  s possible to pinpoint the final  survivor  from very early on .  ,0
a great  funny  sweet movie with morgan freeman  who plays himself  and who meets a spanish girl named scarlet  paz vega  at a small store whilst researching a potential independent film . i was a bit dubious about the film for the first ten minutes but as soon as he was in the store i really started to enjoy the film . it shows how a positive attitude can change anything . it does not contain any complex plots and it is easy to follow but will lift the saddest of moods and make you smile all the way through without the need for petty clich romance . it includes several scenes all the way through which make you clutch your sides with laughter . a very rare masterpiece   ,1
i didn  t expect a movie as good as  in the line of fire  or an episode of      but it looked like this movie was made for tv and did a mediocre job at best . the  good  cast couldn  t disguise the fact that the plot was all too predictable and actors had to struggle  they really try their best i think  through their lines of bad script  giving their rather flat characters any extras . when i watched the movie i got the feeling that i had seen most of this in other  better  movies . in it you had car chases  big shootouts  romance  plot twists etc . etc this movie has none .  br    br    spoiler as soon as you see another woman talking into the phone to cuba  s character  you know who  s behind all this and all the hints you  re being given   you stand too close to the president  see it from my perspective . .   sound silly .  br    br   if it were up to me  and maybe it  s a good thing that it isn  t  i would rewrite the plot like this  br    br   first lady orders the murder of her husband because she is sick and tired of writing checks to cuba all the time .  ,0
star rating  saturday night  friday night  friday morning  sunday night  monday morning  br    br   this second instalment of the che films moves the story forward to the late   s  where the man has now moved his resistance fighters into the hills of south america  surviving without enough food and water and with tensions mounting between the group . everything comes to a head when he crosses the border into bolivia and the government forces step up their campaign to bring him down .  br    br   without the flitting between time and places of the last film  soderbergh  s second instalment focuses solely on the action in the hills  and manages to be an even duller experience . and more pretentiously  the score has been drowned out  giving the second instalment more of an unwelcome air of artsieness that proves just as alienating . there  s just an unshakeable air of boredom to the film that never lets up . you can  t fault soderbergh  s ambition or del toro  s drive in the lead role  it  s just a shame that somewhere in the production things managed to take such a disappointing turn .   ,0
what a load of rubbish . . i can  t even begin to describe how awful this film was . the rating it has here is really hard to believe .  br    br   avoid . . . particularly if you enjoyed the first ginger snaps . the first one was well written  well directed  well executed . . a brilliant film with a fantastic aesthetic and atmosphere . the second one was  alrite   decent as a self  standing film  but clearly not up to the level of the first . . . the third is an insult to the series  period . i rate the films       . it  s that bad .  br    br   oh  and yes it really is set in the past  the sisters are still called ginger and b fitzgerald . . . all muddled in with some half  assed native american mythology . the sisters don  t have any real story  or progression  or even a clear relationship . . . they  re just trying to survive and be  together forever  . that  s about as deep as it gets .  br    br   staggered that the girls agreed to be in this pile  of  shite  after reading the script .  br    br   oh and another thing  staging of action was terrible  people appearing from nowhere regularly  like the girls turn around and there  s an elaborate candle  lit setup with a mystic native american woman just sitting there  about to go into a speech . sets were terrible  couldn  t get away from the fact that it was all obviously based in a set  which really didn  t help . also  there was consistently snow outside the camp  but not a trace inside  . . on the set  .  br    br   arrghh    so bad  i really was hoping it would be at least as good as the second one .  ,0

  footlight parade  is fascinating on so many levels . there is no way the supposedly staged  theater prologues  could have been produced in any theater on earth  of course . think of the huge pools and three  story tall fountains for  by a waterfall   for instance .  berkeley directed john garfield in  they made me a criminal  six years later and had the dead end kids singing  by a waterfall  as they took their showers .   br    br    shanghai lil  is the best production number in the picture . it  s a catalog of    s warner bros . sensibilities . note the african guys mixed into the scene with white and asian prostitutes . you would never see blacks integrated into a social scene in other films of the period unless they were porters on a train or maids in a big house . here the black guys are sitting at the bar and singing with the others . i also get a thrill when the military dancers do a  card section  presentation of roosevelt  s image . there  s also the nra eagle   the logo of the controversial national recovery administration of the new deal . fdr was the new president and hopes were so high that he  d pull the nation out of the depression . you  d never see something so working class oriented coming out of mgm  of course . warner bros . wholeheartedly supported the uplift dictated by the f . d . r . administration .  br    br   dear little miss ruby keeler was never better than she is playing the chinese hooker   lil .  she hardly even watches her feet as she dances  which was one of her signature flaws .  br    br   the pre  code stuff is fun . the  by a waterfall  number is wonderful in that regard . the girls change into their bathing suits on the crowded bus speeding through times square with all its lights on . the spread  eagle girls swimming over the camera provide the kind of crotch shots that would not be seen for   years . in a few months the production code would eliminate such naughty pleasures .  ,1
moonchild is a very difficult movie to categorise . it  s easiest to think of it as several snapshots of the lives of the two central characters . the fact that these characters are members of a street gang set in an multicultural city of the near future and that one of them is a vampire does not preclude them from having moments like any other people  and this is one of the places where this movie is different to anything else i  ve ever heard of . it doesn  t get wrapped up in the fact that one of the main characters is a vampire  it  s just something that has to be dealt with like any other problem . the way the characters interact is surprisingly realistic  there are embarrassing relatives and tricks that are meant to look cool that just don  t work  which leaves the film with a lovely sense of not taking itself too seriously for the most part .  br    br   the other area that really stood out to me is the languages . the fictional city of mallepa contains various cultural groups  and characters speak the language that they would be expected to speak . japanese gang members speak japanese to each other  but chinese when talking to characters of chinese descent . possibly the most amusing exchange involves an australian and is conducted in english . the actors of the four arguably main characters have three separate mother tongues between them and speak varying levels of each others  languages  so it  s quite a feat that the movie was made at all . which  i suppose  brings me to the lead actors .  br    br   much has been made of the fact that the movie stars two of japan  s biggest rockstars  gackt and hyde  as well as taiwanese superstar lee  hom wang  whether it is to praise them for their acting or criticise it or simply fangirl about them . in my opinion  lee  hom is the best at playing a straight and realistic character . however  any lack of acting ability on gackt  s part is mostly masked by the fact that the character he plays is prone to being over  dramatic . i wasn  t sure if hyde  s character was supposed to be as sulky and sarcastic as he came across  but it doesn  t really detract from the movie either way .  br    br   there are several scenes which take rather melodramatic turns  which made it difficult for them to affect me much emotionally  although this doesn  t seem to stop a lot of people  . i found it  s best to just enjoy the movie for what it is and not take it too seriously  it  s perfect for getting out and watching with a group of friends . it does have its flaws  but overall it was very enjoyable and i  d highly recommend it to anyone who doesn  t mind a few subtitles .  ,1
chris and andre are two average  ordinary teens . misunderstood by some and picked on by others . but together they stand and all will pay . together they form  the army of two  . they scheme and plan  zero day  . that day is when they decide to storm their high school and inevitably murder   people in cold blood . told through the tapes that they made  zero day   it is barely a fictionalized telling of the columbine tragedy .  br    br    zero day  is one of those movies that will mess with your head afterwards . the two main actors  calvin robertson and andre keuck  do such a good job that their characters seem like almost any disenfranchised teen walking the street . their performances were very believable  you kinda liked these guys and that was scary . shot on video almost totally from the teen  s perspectives  zero day  feels very real and authentic  like you are right there . these kids try to rationalize their actions to the viewer and the actors sell it to you . but be warned it does follow the tragedy from beginning to end and the ending makes be shocking and uneasy for some .  ,1
i was curious to watch this movie . a lot of people seem to be excited . i also have my beliefs . i believe in jesus christ but i  m opened for any kind of views or opinions . it doesn  t matter for me  if jesus existed in the way it  s written in the bible . if maria was a virgin or not  or all the other similar pagan coincidences . what matters for me is the idea of salvation  the idea of love as the only way to find peace in this world .  br    br   what made me angry is when somebody takes a sentence  present it as a fact but without showing the context it was written . for example  they showed in this movie following sentence big  those enemies of mine who did not want me to be king over them  bring them here and kill them in front of me  jesus  lukas       what they didn  t tell you is the context . jesus told a story about an evil king . there is no passage in the bible where jesus supports killing . he is love  after quoting the bible wrong they present us yelling people  pseudo  christians  filled with hate . the majority of viewers don  t check the informations presented so they start thinking jesushatenot good for me or for anybody else . this is pure manipulation people . please use your brain . don  t take everything as a fact they tell you in this movie . we destroy our own basis  our civilization if we start dismantling jesus in this way and the message he brought to us . you saw off the branch you  re sitting on .  ,0
one of the lamer wedding movies you  ll see . smacks too too much of its time period so it was out of date before it hit the theaters . the ethnic stereotypes are like a henny youngman joke  except they just aint in the least bit funny here . molly ringwald  well what else needs to be said . give you a clue to the silliness  she destroys a        wedding dress  because  it just won  t be me  makes it into this rag  with straps and puts on a top hat  and everyone smiles cutely at her moxy  rather than ringwalding her neck . its a helluva a cast too  check out how heavy ally sheedy is . wheeeew   ,0
filmed in a documentary style  but you can pretty well tell participants had been coached . a recently divorced wannabe film maker  myles berkowitz  sees a chance to liven up his love life and step into the movie biz at the same time . he intends to make a documentary piece about finding love by filming twenty dates including ramifications . the comedy is spotty at best the rest is mishap after mishap . also taking part are richard arlook  robert mckee and the enticing elisabeth wagner . trying for credibility the fetching tia carrere is talked into a cameo . this will suffice as a handbook on how not to get a satisfactory date .  ,0
warning spoiler . . . i have to agree with you  it was almost there . this was such a bad movie  about such and interesting true story . it had such promise  but the acting was ridiculous at best . some sets were beautiful and realistic . others are something out of a theme park . i found myself laughing as i watched  what was suppose to be  serious scenes . i really wanted to like this movie  but i couldn  t . the best part was the fight between friends that ended with the  king  dying . i liked the queens  punishment . and  the final shot made a beautiful picture  though . there are so many better movies to watch . i don  t recommend this .  ,0
david lean  s worst film . even  in which we serve  was  nt as bad as this . usually a film with a really good reputation like this one  has at least some redeeming qualities  which makes one understand why it might be considered a classic . but after watching this i just could not get why this piece of crap was liked so much even back in      i disliked the acting  stiff upper lip british mannerisms  story  script  which may be quite witty at times but totally unfunny  and soundtrack . the elvira character is meant to be alluring and attractive  but was in actual fact ugly and had a weird and annoying voice . just another film that has convinced me not to trust a films reputation . another very overrated  british classic  .  ,0
  white noise  had potential to be one of the most talked about movies since  the exorcist  i think . seeing as evp is supposedly true it really had an easy passage to be a feared true fact . not many movies come along that really instill fear into the minds of people . like i said this movie could have  but did not . the movie degraded itself to a low class pg    scary movie . nothing compared to  the ring  or  the sixth sense  by any means . someone really needs to just take charge in the horror movie industry and just make a movie that not only makes us think  but it makes us jump  scream  everything a horror movie should do . i  m honestly sick of the pg    horror genre  because its becoming a genre of its own . we need the old days back  the blood and gore days  the freddy kruger  the jason  the mike myers days . few movies can pull off a think about this mentality being so not scary . so why try to pull it off  a few good jumps in this movie amount to nothing but one of the stupidest endings in movie history with no resolution at all . . . don  t waste your money on this movie .  ,0
this movie seemed to have it all going for it with good camera  sound  film  sets  music  costumes . . . but drum  roll  gary stretch spoke  i don  t know if it was his poor acting or simply a bad script  but would say it was both . considering the casting of him in this role  i found it difficult to root for him even to the very end . i wished he  d have died in battle or one of the sword  knife scuffles .  br    br   then  the tinder for the plot to kill the king was because the king didn  t have dinner and sex with his queen  pretty lame . and to go to the extreme to kill her own son  and to then push up her lover as succeeding king  i see a thread or two here and there of historical bytes  but the manner in which this was all presented was farcical .  br    br   i don  t recognize gary stretch from anything else  but he was dreadful . i read another user  s comments about audio being dubbed  but don  t think his was dubbed . . . after all  he speaks english  right  it really was awful . the lines were read right off the coroner  s table . . . flat  line . it could be he just doesn  t have the voice to carry tone fluctuations .  br    br   aside from this  i did watch it to the end  so the movie had at least an  interest .  it could have been more if the script  lines and casting had been given more work . the scenery and filming crew along with very good quality film is what really made this movie above all else . the cast and story were all secondary . i give the film crew a   .  ,0

so many wonderful actresses in one film serve as a practical invitation to the local movie house so i duly responded . here are some remarks . .  br    br   vanessa redgrave is great even while lying in bed . she also looks very old and i don  t think this is achieved with much make  up which is a good thing for the film but a sad thing for us cinema  goers . i think her aging got a bit harsh in recent years . claire danes continues her welcome return to the movies and exudes a definite warmth . mamie gummer  s resemblance to her mother merly streep both in terms of physical appearance and acting style is so striking that i lost my concentration to the film for a couple of minutes after her entrance . she is surprisingly good however such a resemblance has the danger of working against her favor . i agree with a previous comment natasha richardson definitely had some plastic job done to her face . she certainly does not look like how i remember her from previous films   nell  for example .  both she and toni collette sadly do not make much impression partly because they do not look convincing as sisters . their interplay is weak . toni collette additionally is way too old for her character . glenn close and meryl streep had to have more screen time . streep  s performance actually is little more than a cameo . her scenes on the other hand have bigger emotional resonance than the rest of the film . eileen atkins provides some welcome dry wit  especially in her second role as an imaginary nighttime companion to redgrave  s character . as for the men hugh dancy enlivenes the film considerably even though he gives a broader performance than needed . as a matter of fact as soon as he exits the story it starts to drag . it is also to his credit that he manages to create the exact necessary sense of boyish charm in the viewer . patrick wilson on the other hand is a complete void at the center of the film . he also has the misfortune that the script is insufficient in explaining why three people  one of them a man  are so much smitten by this man . the backstory to this should have been developed more .  br    br   the cinematography is excellent as expected . however the main summer house set failed to convince me . it does not look natural on the top of that rocky hill  particularly with its grass patch in the front . a bit too cardboard like .  br    br   overall  the film is a classy production  but a seen  it  all  before  cried  at  it  all  before feeling took over me during most of its duration and consequently it failed to make the kind of impact on me that i expected from a tearjerker . however  it still managed to make me thoughtful about the passing of time  about one  s expectations from life and the extent to which these are fulfilled or not . worth trying at least on dvd if not at the movies . . .  ,1
this is one of those films that explore the culture clash of eastern born people in westernized cultures .  br    br   loving on tokyo time is a sad film about the inability of opposites to attract due to major cultural differences . ken  rock n  roll fanatic  marries kyoto  a japanese girl  so that she can stay in the united states when her visa expires . the marriage is only expected to be temporary  that is  until kyoto gains legal status again . but  ken  who seems to be lost in every relationship  takes a liking to kyoto and tries very hard to make things work out . this  despite his friend  s urging that dumping kyoto and getting rid of all commitments to girls is bad for rock n  roll except to inspire some song writing about broken hearts and all of that .  br    br   but kyoto comes from a strict traditional japanese upbringing  and doesn  t expect to be married to ken all that long . not only that  she is homesick and wants to return to japan . it  s sad in that this is finally someone ken thinks he can love and be with and all that  except the one time he thinks he  s found someone to feel that way about  the girl isn  t expecting to stay that long . it  s not that she doesn  t like ken  it  s just that she  s used to a whole  nother way of life . she says   i can  t tell him the way i feel in english  and ken can  t tell me the way he feels in japanese .  it  s a rather sad love story with a killer   s techno  nintendo soundtrack .  br    br   i picked up loving on tokyo time because it reminded me of one of my favorite   s films  tokyo pop . and  for those of you who enjoyed loving on tokyo time  check out tokyo pop  a new york singer goes to japan and joins a japanese american cover band   except it  s a movie with a happy ending .  br    br    ,1
i have three comments to make about this film  which i discovered hanging out forlornly in a lower shelf at blockbuster . first off  it is interesting to see the approaches film makers take in trying to film essentially unfilmable works . some have  as kubrick did with  lolita   gotten the original author to write a screenplay that is something like the original work . of course that can  t happen here kraft  ebing is long dead . some have used the premises of the original work as a launch point to go in a completely new  unrelated direction  the recent adaptation of  tristram shandy  comes to mind here  . you can dumb it down  the film of  slaughterhouse five  is to my mind an example of that . or you can simply take the format of the original and try to render it in cinematic vignettes . that would be the approach of woody allen  s  everything you wanted to know about sex   and  arguably  this film . upon consideration  it is probably the only thing one can do with a scholarly work like  psychopathia sexualis  . the potential loss is that whatever cumulative point the original work had is obscured or destroyed . and so it is here .  br    br   point two is the cinematic style . some would call it an  homage  to murnau  pabst  carl dreyer  etc .  but i think it more crude than that . its far too heavy handed and self  conscious to be effective for long . it is eventually just annoying .  br    br   point three is perhaps a less intellectual observation . how did the people responsible for this manage to make a film about wild sexual deviations and perversion that is so incredibly boring  i found the film impossible to pay attention to  and anyone who is not automatically drawn to depictions of sexual deviance will find it so as well . i don  t want to be completely uncharitable and say the film is pointless  but i have to say that whatever point the film makers had is rather obscured by the nature of the source material  the overt copying of filmic styles  and the stubborn refusal to engage the audience on an emotional level  possibly for fear of being accused of titillation  .  br    br   the film is a dubious exercise from the start and doesn  t really work for me  i  m sorry to say .  ,0
well  no  not really . its not really a good movie  but its not as bad as i thought it was going to be . i really didn  t feel ripped off of my rental money  and sometimes thats all you can ask for . the plot is ok  nothing brilliant or new  the acting is pretty bad  but the cast is pretty . the directing is passable  but the effects are horrible  especially the werewolf effects  which in a werewolf movie  is a pretty big problem . there was a fairly decent amount of nudity  which to me is a pretty good thing  but it wasn  t all that hot . all in all  its a fairly average direct to video movie  not the worst film i  ve ever seen and if you  re bored a genre fan  check it out sometime . i  d even watch it again .  br    br   bonus fact for horror geeks  kane hodder  jason vorhees in a few of them  plays the werewolf .  ,0
first of all  let me say that this is not the movie for people looking to watch something spirited and joyous for the holidays . this movie is cold  brutal  and just downright depressing . mary steenburgen plays a grinchy mom who is down on christmas because her husband has lost his job  they are losing their house  can  t buy christmas presents for the kids  etc . you get the idea  happy stuff for the holidays . so along comes harry dean stanton as gideon the christmas angel  who in his dark hat and long overcoat comes off more like a pedophile who hangs around children all day observing them . what better way to instill the spirit of christmas in mary steenburgen than to kill off her family and then offer to bring them back if she believes in christmas again . santa claus is a blackmailer and his christmas workshop looks more like a haven for refugee nazis on the lam . the movie lays everything on so thick that you don  t care about the happy ending when it comes because the rest of the movie is so bitter and unbelievable . i  m sure this film wanted to be something capra  like  but it left out the joy and sentiment on what a holiday film should be .  ,0
ben a out  of  town cop is convinced his sister was brutally killed and wants to bring her killer to justice  but he  s approached by stefan who believes his sister was a victim of a werewolf cult . so ben  his sister  s best friend and stefan travel to transylvania to put a end to this evil .  br    br   this is incredibly awful b  grade stuff and i wondered how it even got released . it makes the original  howling  look like a masterpiece . what was christopher lee thinking  as this has to be his worst performance i  ve seen .  br    br   there was a lot wrong with this real cheap  ass film  ranging from the really hammy and wooden performances from annie mcenroe  reb brown  marsha a . hunt and sybil danning  not to forgot lee   cheesy fashion  those sunnies   cheap and lame special effects  bad use of lighting  the humour . . . if there was any  trashy   s music  with some of the film just focusing on some unknown band playing   werewolf  s having orgies which is a sight to see and a tiresome story with flat and annoying dialogue . i thought if it was that bad it would be awfully funny  but i was wrong .  br    br   the positives were the location and settings of the film looked great  but that  s about it . . . actually i  ll add sybil danning short stripping scene too .  br    br   during the end credits the band plays their crap  house song during a weird montage of scenes from the film  which i beckon the question why   br    br   an awful piece of mess  however at least it isn  t boring .  br    br       ,0
this is a pretty ok film . . . yes some parts are lame and exceptionally convenient  and the movie doesn  t really justify the large star cast  ab  sd  tanuja  . however  the actor that really impressed me here was kay kay menon  not to be confused with the singer kk  . in the scene where he first meets amitabh  s character  i thought that a man who can just look at ab  keep staring and not say a word  and still look strong  is definitely a good actor . in fact  he has proved himself worthy again in sarkar  alongside ab for a second time . this guy should get more roles  he  s brilliant .  br    br   if you  ve read any of the other reviews here on imdb  you already know the plot  and i do agree that akshaye khanna  s entry into pakistan was a little too easy . and the little love angle he shared with  what  s  her  face  was completely unnecessary . but he is a fairly good actor  as seen in dch   sunjay dutt is cool to watch  always . and ab . . . what can i say . i don  t know if i  m his biggest fan in the world  but i know i can definitely compete for the spot .  br    br   an interesting watch  considering it  s bollywood  although a bit inspired by hollywood oldies like  the great escape  and  bridge on the river kwai  .  ,1
the best thing about camp films in general is that you know what to expect . it  s like watching a professional wrestling match or a day time soap opera or a jerry springer show you immediately can follow the skimpy plot  identify the cardboard characters  and watch in satisfaction while all the cliches are being fulfilled . however  at times  the director does something real unexpected . it may be something extraordinarily stupid  or something weird  or something insightful . the director makinen is up there with the best camp directors  and this is his best movie .  br    br   in yon saalistajat  everything seems to come together . there  s nothing good about it  but still manages to be a coherent whole . not once does the movie slow down  the action flows on and punches keep on coming .  br    br   the weirdest thing is that there  s no sense of time some characters seem to take months doing something while other characters have only spent one hour at a bar . this is partially due to finnish summer where the sun never sets  so you don  t experience the day turning into a night at all .  br    br   finally there is a plot  there  somewhere . you may have to watch the movie three times before you realize it  though .  ,0
wow . this movie bored the pants off me when i saw it . bland  pointless and unmoving .  br    br   apparently  ash and co . can travel through time with the help of  the spirit of the forest    princess mononoke  much    there  they meet a dorky kid named sam  and the  plot  begins .  br    br   so tom  ash  and huck  sam  get high with nature  become hippies and try to free celebi  the  spirit   from some weirdo hunter guy . i don  t even know what else went on . it all went by in a blur . ash  s friends were hardly in it  and all the fight scenes were boring .  br    br   after saving the day  ash and his infamous friends  must return to their time  while watching sam float away with celebi  that scene was just creepy . o  o  then  after returning to their time  ash learns that his new friend is actually his rival  s grandpa . and i think that  s it . pretty retarded isn  t it  if you love your children  you won  t expose them to this .   out of   .   ,0
the feel of this movie was amazing . adam sandler  s performance was very inspiring . as he played a very rattled and fragile character  he took his ability to the very edge and really worked the role . his character was really interesting . i can see myself reading the script for this movie and not being half as interested in the part as sandler made me . for someone who plays primarily comedy roles  he pulled off a serious role with what seemed to be his own quirks and input . i especially loved the scene in which adam and don  s characters rode the motorized scooter around the city . i familiarized with the moment  because it seemed like don was witnessing one thing adam does to get away from it all . with his video games  music  and many other things he does to keep him from thinking about the past  riding his scooter with his headphones on seemed like an escape from his thoughts . this movie is definitely worth the watch .  ,1
the cover of the box makes this movie look really good  don  t be fooled . splatter university came out in     which was the last good year for horror  but this movie sucks . the characters are so annoying . only the teacher is cool . there is like no plot to this movie  who the hell would ever produce this waste of a film   br    br   spoilers up ahead  br    br   the teacher dies in this  and it was a female  we all know that we must have a female surviver  if you  re going to break the rules do it in a good horror flick not this waste  ,0
this very strange movie is unlike anything made in the west at the time . with its tumultuous emotions and net of visions  dreams  and startling images  its effect is both beautiful and unsettling . the actors are choreographed more like dance than acting . it contains the only dream sequence i know of that actually resembles a real nightmare  sorry  dali fans  .  ,1
john rivers  life as an architect and family man has taken a turn for the worst when his wife has disappeared and has been concluded dead after a freakish accident that involved changing a tyre on her car . during the days she has been missing  he confronts a man that  s been following and he tells him that his been in contact with his dead wife from the other  side through e . v . p  electronic voice phenomenon . naturally he doesn  t believe it but then hear gets weird phone calls from her phone and so he contacts the man to find out more about e . v . p . soon enough john is hooked onto it  but something supernatural doesn  t like him interfering with the dead  as now other then contacting his wife  the white noise is foretelling events before they happen .  br    br   since this dvd has been sitting on my shelf for a while now  i thought i better get around to watching it since it wasn  t my copy . but then again i don  t think the owners were in a hurry to get it back  as they haven  t question me about it . oh well . so i decided to give it a play  as i was in an undemanding mood . after hearing and reading all the bad press on it  i wasn  t expecting anything remotely good  but i was kept entertained for   minutes . well  more so the   minutes  as the last half  an  hour was pretty much a blur of confusion . the film is nowhere as good as it could have been  but the time breezed by quick enough even though it  s a rather tepid supernatural thriller . i thought it wasn  t all a waste . the first hour i found some effective sequences rather interesting and there  s a spooky awe generated with a slow progression of subtle stillness and tragedy that haunts you  but sadly that comes to a crashing halt later on in the film . that  s when the predictably forced jump scares come into their own and somehow it just doesn  t fit in with the context . it becomes rather hectic  loud and very muddled with its mtv style editing and kinetic camera  work that gets to close into the action . i couldn  t understand what was going on within choppy and abrupt climax . the whole explanation how everything fits into the bigger picture is pure hokey . it  s a very unsatisfying conclusion because it goes for something big  but hits rock bottom . i thought they did fine job up until that point with the lighting and showy camera  work . other then the distinctively stark lighting  the score kept this flick atmospherically gloomy . all of it is very slickly done with its glossed up and fancy hardware  which makes it come across as very sterile and empty .  br    br   you can easily see that the film  s heart is in the technical components and not in expanding the characters and story . there  s just no connection and lasting sentiment within this flimsy material . after a while  it just tries too hard to convince you that it falls into manipulative thrills and popping in many blood  curdling stuff from beyond the grave . it just got rather repetitious watching someone watch a fuzzy tv screen after while . the e . v . p machine was the star on the show . well  it did have more impact than the limp performances . michael keaton is more than capable actor  but lately his disappeared off the map and here he provides a modest performance as the dangerously obsessed john rivers . he really deserves much better  though . everyone else is pretty brittle and forgettable . not because of the performances  but of the lack of depth in their characters . this clunker wasn  t bad to begin with  but it does go pear shape by falling away drastically .  br    br   i wouldn  t care to see it again and i wouldn  t recommend to anyone  unless you got a interest for the subject matter and enjoy the recent crop of hollywood produced horror  thrillers . it  s just a damn shame that this over  produced flick couldn  t put it together successfully  as it had promise in its idea and a more than decent cast on hand . i didn  t hate it  but what a disappointment .  ,0
at the beginning of the film we watch may and toots preparing for their trip to london for a visit to their grown children . one can see toots is not in the best of health  but he goes along . when he dies suddenly  may  s world  begins to spin out of control .  br    br   the film directed by roger michell  based on a screen play by hanif kureshi  is a study of how this mother figure comes to terms with her new status in life and her awakening into a world that she doesn  t even know it existed until now .  br    br   may  s life as a suburban wife was probably boring . obviously her sexual life was next to nothing . we get to know she  s had a short extra marital affair  then nothing at all . when may loses her husband she can  t go back home  so instead  she stays behind minding her grandson at her daughter  s home . it is in this setting that may begins lusting after young and hunky darren  her daughter  s occasional lover .  br    br   darren awakes in may a passion she has not ever known . may responds by transforming herself in front of our eyes . may  who at the beginning of the film is dowdy  suddenly starts dressing up  becoming an interesting and attractive woman . she ends up falling heads over heels with this young man that keeps her sated with a passion she never felt before .  br    br   having known a couple of cases similar to this story  it came as no surprise to me to watch may  s reaction . her own chance of a normal relationship with bruce  a widower  ends up frustratingly for may  who realizes how great her sex is with darren . the younger man  we figure  is only into this affair to satisfy himself and for a possibility of extorting money from may . finally  the daughter  helen discovers what mum has been doing behind her back when she discovers the erotic paintings her mother has made .  br    br   the film is a triumph for the director . in anne reid  mr . michell has found an extraordinary actress who brings so much to the role of may . also amazing is daniel craig . he knows how darren will react to the situation . anna wilson jones as helen is also vital to the story as she is the one that has to confront the mother about what has been going on behind her back . oliver ford davies plays a small part as bruce the older man in helen  s class and is quite effective .  br    br   the film is rewarding for those that will see it with an open mind .  br    br    ,1
a visit by hitler in rome is the backdrop of this tender story of love  friendship  homosexuality and fascism . sophia loren plays the housewife and mother of six children who stays at home while her entire family go to the military parade in honor of hitler and mussolini . she has to stay at home since the family cannot afford a maid . she would have loved to go though as she along with the entire housing complex where she lives is an ardent admirer of il duce .  br    br   there is one exception though . across the yard sits marcello mastroianni on his chair contemplating suicide . the reason  he is homosexual and because of that has recently lost his job as a radio announcer . the film really takes off when these two people meet by chance . mastroianni is in despair and badly in need of a friend . loren  frustrated by her own cheating husband misunderstands mastroianni and in a masterfully shot  directed and acted scene on the roof of the building complex offers her body to him only to be rejected . the initial chock is replaced soon afterwards by her hunger for this man  this anti fascist  this homosexual  this other world who is so willing to give her all that she longs for .  br    br   this is a beautifully crafted movie with two of the most talented actors ever . loren proves here that she is an actress of caliber when well directed . this is a simple but yet powerful film about fascism  love  ordinary people and most importantly the human condition . despite its sad ending there is a glimpse of hope in the denouement  things will change  someone has understood .  ,1
i found this movie boring  monotonous and quite uninteresting with a hurried  shallow  upbeat  ending that didn  t ring true to the overall story . following these characters through a weekend of awful events  unfriendly attitudes and bad news just isn  t my idea of a watchable  interesting movie and i got very tired of its  one note  theme and couldn  t wait for it to end   in fact i almost stopped about halfway through . the whole movie just seemed pointless and wandering  and the characters were for the most part depressing and unpleasant  though the acting was good . a small movie with small ambitions and small appeal   sorry  but it just didn  t make it with me  and i love good  small films  this one just didn  t jell  though i kept watching it hoping and trusting that it would . i was disappointed  especially after two local reviewers put it on their  year  s   best  list . i  d strongly recommend watching  the house of sand  instead   now there  s a good  small film   ,0
i  m in awe  wow  prepare to be blown away by the uncanny ways of the ninja . watch them as they pounce  crawl along the ground  on their backs or stomachs  like a caterpillar  fly through the sky  climb buildings  hide and spring from trees  throw about ninja stars  role out blue welcome mats  disappear in smoke bombs  make a lot of swoosh noises with their blades and quickly sneaking or trotting about on their toes . what a sight  really i could go on about the many traditional actions  but i  ll be here all day . oh not to forget we even get the legendary chuck connors popping up now and again  and watch him dispatch some ninjas with his shotgun with little ease . what class  what a badass  anyhow the ultra  cheap  sakura killers  is some stupid  but cheesy ninja action fun that only fanatics of the genre would get anything out of this shonky b  grade debacle .  br    br   a genetic lab in america has a very important video that  s stolen by a couple of ninjas . two americans are sent to japan by the colonel  chuck connors  to retrieve it .  br    br   the opening of the feature sets it up nicely . get ready for the laughs  afterwards it slows down  but soon after the two main protagonists learns about the ninja and goes through the training it gets a head of steam as they break in costumes and fled after the stolen beta tape that contains a very important formula . this is when the violently swift action and aerobic marital arts really come in to play . it  s not too shoddy either   like the moronic script and daft performances  . the final climatic showdown is very well done .  br    br   in the slow stretches it has the two americans  mike kelly and george nicholas  looking in to the case  sharing brainless conversations and encountering some minor problems . what made me laugh was how the ninjas were put off by how brave and clever these two were . these were supposed to be professional killers  director dusty nelson   effects         does an earnest job with what he had and plays it for what it is . he centres the on  screen activities around striking taiwan locations . the score is a chintzy arrangement .  ,0
boy what a dud this mess was . but it only lasts an hour and i only paid a buck for it so i  ll live . . . . unlike the entire cast of this     clunker who are all dust by now .  br    br   so anyway a small village starts having bodies turning up that have been drained of all their blood . the local yokels start talking about vampires  of course  and a little more loudly after each body is found . the town sheriff or constable or whatever he is  played by awesome actor melvyn douglas  tries to tell them otherwise . when he mentions the fact that the dead have one large hole on each side of the neck  instead of two holes close together  the locals simply then say it  s a giant vampire bat . the constable insists that vampires do not exist and it must be a human culprit doing the killings .  br    br   but melvyn doesn  t seem too bothered either way . he spends most of his time trying to get into the pantaloons of his sweetie  played by faye wray . also in this mix is the town simpleton  played by dwight frye  who always seemed to have played the same role in every movie he did . he further freaks out the townspeople by catching bats and drinking his own blood . lionel atwill plays the town doctor who seemingly is trying to help the constable solve the crimes . and boy does he ever stink as an actor . atwill is as close to cardboard in this role as he could get . and lionel barrymore is also in this thing . . . . lots of big names to be such a pile of guano .  br    br   other than the terrible mis  title this movie has  the alternate name   the blood sucker  is much better  this movie is also dull and plodding and just silly .  br    br   for me the high point of the movie is watching frye  he nails the freaky town weirdo but other than him this movie didn  t offer much . and then when you find out the reason for the strange deaths and see the special effect thing that required all this blood you  ll really be let down .  br    br   bela lugosi did a lot of awful pictures but at least he was fun and interesting to watch . think of this movie as a really bad lugosi clunker without lugosi and you  ll get a feel for how miserably bad this mess was .  br    br   if you can  t make a good      s horror film at least put lugosi in it .  ,0
one out of ten stars  br    br   because if it was  it gets an f . holy mother mary of god was this bad . i mean  i gave it every reasonable accommodation considering it was a straight to video film  but it let me down at every turn . like so many other b movies  the basic storyline was decent and the filmmakers seemed to have a reasonable level of resources  but the execution was ridiculous . it  s a shame they attached the good name of halloween to this fiasco .  br    br   the basic premise surrounds some frat douche bags hosting their annual halloween haunted house fund raiser  when a satanic spell book shows up out of nowhere and hurls the frat boys into a living hell . well that  s the idea anyway  but instead most of the film is devoted to displaying these frat boy  s relationship escapades  abound with an outrageous lesbian subplot . very little of the actual story is devoted to halloween or the mysterious spell book . it actually makes me mad that the film makers thought they could get away with making such dribble .  br    br   the film is essentially about frat boy relationships . this is not what the movie is billed as . i  m tempted to track down the producers and at the very least threaten them with bodily harm . the acting is about as bad as it gets  it  s atrocious  the script is unintentionally funny . the cinematography is just plain lazy . the whole film is amateur night . this movie actually makes the syfy channel movie productions look like masterpieces .  br    br   the last half hour of the film felt like the film makers realized they weren  t producing a soap opera and had to throw in some sort of horror sequences . the evil spell book finally comes into play and turns everyone in the haunted house into the character their dressed up as . i almost feel like crying as i write this review . wow  i mean wow  this thing was an undecipherable chopped up disaster .  ,0
i have rarely been subjected to such outright nonsense in a film that is supposed to be based on a historical figure . a horrible joke of a film  i cringed throughout . terrible  trite  distorted and riddled with outright lies and half truths .  br    br   the famous hitler biographer ian kershaw was to originally be a consultant for this film . however  he found the script to be so historically inaccurate and ridiculous that he refused  and also demanded they stop using his name as a source  it embarrassed him to think people would think he was involved  .  br    br   one scene shows hitler beating his dog . there is not one source for this . hitler loved animals above people . he brought in the strictest animal welfare laws in europe  banned vivisection and animal experimentation . he was also a vegetarian .  br    br   the film turns his gaining of the iron cross into a farce  involving bribery . utter lies . he was awarded it for repeated acts of bravery over a long period of time .  br    br   there are no historical documents showing that hitler ever had a sexual relationship with his niece . not one .  br    br   apart from these  hitler is portrayed as a rabid simpleton in this garbage flick .  br    br   if he was even half as ignorant  demented and thick as he is in this nonsense film as in real life you would not even know he had ever existed . never mind become the leader of germany .  br    br   honestly  this film was utterly terrible .  br    br   go watch downfall and give this a very wide berth .  ,0
basically  the movie might be one of the most mesmerizing titles made by either of the two scotts  ridley and tony  . let  s make it straight  the movie deserved its hype as one of the most stylish actioner  thriller ever made .  br    br   when it comes to disgruntled tragic heroes  denzel washington and tony scotts really make a perfect duo . both this movie and deja vu are better thrillers you can expect . washington really got very comfortable in the shaky cameras and every executing scenes in the movie . one would easily be related to his character  s emotions therefore enjoyed all the killings on the road . it  s a success that they created a super  dark mexico city with a lot of shits happening . one would be easily convinced by the extent of corruption depicted in man on fire . i don  t know what would the mexicans think when they watch this . . . . . .  br    br   well  let  s face it again . it  s among the best of the death wish genre  but it also suffered from extensive amount of violence . it  s a bit annoying that they justify the actions of a vigilante by making the movie very realistic and let denzel washington play the  missing sheep  type of tragic hero . in the end  they even had the kidnapper shot in his own swimming pool like a documentary . i was checking on imdb if the movie was based on real events for that . . . . . . so that  s for your consideration if you also finds the movie  s theme is a little bit phony .  br    br   at the end  i hope one would not take this movie for real .  br    br       for art direction  editing  cinematographic  denzel washington .  ,1
perhaps one of the most overrated so  called horror classics ever made  halloween does feature the memorable michael myers and some great acting by jamie lee curtis .  br    br   however  its rewatchability factor is very close to zero  as there is an unforgivable amount of time spent on dullness  culmination to the actual events .  br    br   this is the sort of movie you can walk away from to microwave popcorn and not miss anything at all .  br    br   how it spawned so many sequels  i will never comprehend .  br    br   thank god rob zombie is remaking this . and generally  i hate remakes .  br    br   surely he will more than compensate for all the random time  filling gaps with some quirky points of interest that the original severely lacks .  br    br   this is a movie we feel we have to like  much like the way we  re taught that we should enjoy dickens .  br    br   don  t assume this is a classic .  ,0
i was not really a big fan of star trek until past    years . thanks to the advent of netflix and post     video technology distribution  i am able to embark into the past of all the great star trek episodes . for those that don  t really watch every single episode and know them by heart  through tng  ds   voyager  etc .  general popular consensus will say    i like the next generation  the best . that  s because captain picard and his crew were fresh when they first appeared after decades of star trek starvation . but to be quiet honest  i appreciate the creativity of voyager  s episodes more than tng . voyager  s episodes also progresses through time unlike tng . granted data from tng is great but it eventually gets old but voyager  s doctor   now that  s creativity  instead of making artificial intelligence awkward and jerky  give him the freedom to express beyond anything you imagined . not only is picardo such a great actor but the premise setting for his expansive  self growth  as a doctor  self realization now that is science fiction at its best  endgame portray him as a husband married to an  organic   inventing neuro  implant transceiver for human  machine interface  and even   in the episode before endgame  to disobey captain  s order and make  human  mistakes . unlike ds  which are blessed with  beautiful women right from  st episode  voyager has to survive  seasons without jeri ryan and i believe it is picardo that carried them with his personality . of course the rest of the voyager  s cast chemistry just flows effortless  harry kim and tom paris   very natural . i love tuvoc occasional humor  despite being a vulcan . finally  i  m so glad they got rid of that original female captain   oh  if you get to watch the rare footage   thank god for kate  she has developed through the  years into an extremely confident  believable  and respectable female captain . what a great job  thank you star trek for making voyager  i enjoy every episode  the creative exploration of possibilities  of morals  and of our cosmic expanse .  ,1

caught this film in about     on video by chance and without knowing what i was in for . many horror fans may have missed this thinking it was a typical prison film and the ones who did get it didn  t like it as it was not what they wanted to see . the above mentioned factors are probably the reasons it is low rated but just ignore that and give it a whirl if you  re a fan of the genre .  br    br   it has strong suits in all departments from script and atmosphere to acting and the prison itself .  br    br   an absolute diamond  a film i still have on video to this day . check it out .  ,1
this film is like a      version of ettore scola  s brutti sporchi e cattivi . less sex and less realism  but a tale with great humanism and warmth . i wouldn  t call this a neo  realistic picture . it  s very sentimental and more like a fairy tale  and should probably be classed as a comedy  although it deals with serious matters  a little like chaplin or      comedy  . typical italian though  very emotional  and hard to resist except for a stone cold person . the sentimentalism is a letdown  although this picture was not meant to be a realistic drama . it  s not a masterpiece like umberto d or the bicycle thief . but it is a lovable and hilarious comedy  with good music .  br    br        ,1
with this abc family attempt of the hit blockbuster  cheaper by the dozen  comes an obnoxious amount of corny dialogue  shallow plot lines  and cheesy comebacks . with about two good actors among many wanna  be  s  this movie was a major disappointment . its a hollywood  wannabe ditto of an already bad plot . then  because they needed a lot of actors  that meant that they  d probably be more lenient . so the acting wasn  t five  star . the plot moved fairly fast  and the twists were bad and had horrible timing . the junction of characters and the  end relationships  were also too mushy and clichd for me . spare yourself and rent something better .  ,0
be careful with this one . once you get yer mitts on it  it  ll change the way you look at kung  fu flicks . you will be yearning a plot from all of the kung  fu films now  you will be wanting character depth and development  you will be craving mystery and unpredictability  you will demand dynamic camera work and incredible backdrops . sadly  you won  t find all of these aspects together in one kung  fu movie  except for five deadly venoms   br    br   easily the best kung  fu movie of all  time  venoms blends a rich plot  full of twists and turns  with colourful  and developed  characters  along with some of the best camerawork to come out of the   s . the success of someone liking the film depends on the viewers ability to decipher which character is which  and who specializes in what venom . one is the centipede  two is the snake  three is the scorpion  four is the lizard  and five is the toad . each character has different traits  characteristics  strengths  and weaknesses . therein lies the hook  we learn along with the student character  finding out who these different men turn out to be . we are in his shoes  so to speak   and we have to pick who we trust  and who we don  t  just like he does . we learn along with him .  br    br   not only is the plot  the characters  and the camerawork great  it  s also fun to watch  which in my book makes it more valuable than almost any other movie of it  s kind . it  s worth quite a few watches to pick up on everything that  s going on . venoms is a lesson on what kung  fu can really do . . . just don  t expect many other kung  fu films to live up to it  s gauntlet .  ,1
i loved the real mc coys            it is too bad that lydia reed has decided to be forgotten and not appear . she was excellent in the show . of course walter brennan was great as well as tony martnez . i loved it when he called amos seor grampa . i have purchased season i on dvd and i cannot wait to buy seasons    . if only there would be more shows on television like this one  everything would be better . this show appeared briefly in the summer of     but then disappeared . god bless all the departed members of the cast and please  llydia reed  make yourself known again to the public . you are loved and respected . the real mc coys will live forever .  ,1
what can one say about elvira that hasn  t already been said in the world  s press  the classic comedienne that is elvira delivers in her first full  length big budget comedy masterpiece .  br    br   from the very first movie frame thingy  elvira packs an acting punch that clearly says film great . . . . eat your heart out  bette davis  see a forlorn elvira  see an excitable elvira  see a jealous elvira  see a murderous elvira . you can do nothing but marvel at her acting prowess   br    br   at the heart of this comedy masterpiece is elvira  s desire for las vegas show stardom . despite putting  the boob back in the boobtube  as a horror hostess  with the mostest   elvira finds the small screen constrictive emotionally . . . . and physically  nuff said  she packs up her kitbag and heads east . . . . a hotdog in one hand and a letter from her aunt  s lawyer outlining her inheritance  windfall  in the other .  br    br   i  ve seen this movie so many times  i can almost recite it verbatim . . . .  verbatim would just be showing off    br    br   grab a copy  laugh yourself silly  learn the lines . . . .  br    br   why she didn  t win the best actress oscar for this role is beyond me .  ,1
trick or treat is a fine example of hollywood jumping on the  backwards messages in metal music  bandwagon that tipper gore and her washington wives kick  started in the mid     s  other  less successful entries in this mini  genre include the awful black roses and silly the gate  . i was a sophomore in high school when trick or treat came out and couldn  t wait to see it . it seemed to disappear from video stores by the end of the    s  but i finally picked up a budget  priced dvd copy a short while ago and it brought back many pleasant metal memories from back in the day . any teenage metal nerd could relate to the trials of eddie  ragman  weinbauer  marc price of  family ties   in this film as he is persecuted by the preppie  beautiful  people in his high school for his heavy metal fashions and musical taste . eddie  s favorite rock star is sammi curr  who looks a lot like tommy lee of motley crue   who is killed in a hotel fire early in the movie . eddie is inconsolable till he receives a test pressing of sammi  s final  unreleased album from a radio dj  gene simmons of kiss in a brief cameo  . eddie soon discovers that this lp  when played backwards  allows him to communicate with the undead spirit of sammi curr himself  soon sammi is giving eddie advice on how to get even with his preppie torturers but when the messages escalate in scariness   waste  em all . . . no false metal    eddie tries to destroy the album  which results in sammi coming back to life via eddie  s stereo speakers . sammi rampages to the big dance at eddie  s high school and takes the stage to rock the crowd and disintegrate a few unlucky  false metallers  before eddie arrives to save the day and the girl of his dreams .  sigh  no  it  s not terribly scary in      it wasn  t even scary in      but trick or treat is a movie that will bring a smile to the face of any     s metaller and has a kick  ass soundtrack courtesy of the cult band fastway . well worth seeking out if you  ve ever banged your head or have a taste for b  grade horror movies  or both  like me  .  ,1
what a muddled mess . i saw this with a friend a while ago and we both consider ourselves open  minded to the many wonders of cinema  but this sure isn  t one of them .  br    br   while there very well could be some good ideas  concepts and there are certainly some good performances  under the circumstances   it is all buried under random nonsense . sir anthony draws way too heavily from the same gene pool as natural born killers  u turn and similar films as far as the editing is concerned  or maybe he watched himself in nixon for inspiration . say what you want about david lynch  but at least he more often than not has a method to the madness .  br    br   his quote of stating that he made the film as a joke says it all . it  s not worth your money  bandwidth or time .  ,0
this film is mesmerizing in its beauty and creativity . an artist  s profound vision  his art that springs intuitively from its natural source brings us an inspiring hosanna  blending his creations with trees  white water dashing against rocks  fields and rain . . . andy goldsworthy makes the viewer feel joy in being alive  aware that we are all made of the clay of this glorious earth . he doesn  t spare us his occasional frustration  but on the whole we see the miracle in joining art with nature . credit also goes of course to the filmmaker  thomas riedelsheimer  who directed  photographed and edited the movie with incredible sensibility and perfect timing .  br    br   if you have any feeling for beauty  nature and art . . . do not miss this fantastic film   ,1
thank you hollywood . yet another movie classic utterly ruined by a cheap  shallow  effect  heavy and redundant remake . the original  planet of the apes  was an intelligent and thought  provoking movie with a very clear message . it was a movie that focused almost entirely on dialogue  which sounds very dull but was in fact very interesting .  br    br   this movie  on the other hand  seems to have done away with pretty much all the dialogues . instead of a great movie we get an incredibly stupid two hour chase movie . dialogue has been reduced to a mere minimum  character interaction and development are non  existent and most of the time it  s extremely hard to figure out what  s going on . instead  we get a bunch of pointless action scenes  some marginally funny one  liners and some very hollow quasi  intelligent conversations .  br    br   the only thing worth mentioning about this movie is that it looks absolutely fantastic . the make  up of the apes is magnificent  and the sets and backgrounds are beautiful too . however  this does not distract from the fact that  planet of the apes        is a very shallow and simplistic movie  filled with paper  thin characters  stupid dialogue and a nearly non  existent plot . please hollywood  stop ruining great movies by turning them into senseless blockbusters .  br    br   oh yeah  the ending did not make any sense whatsoever .  br    br    out of  stars  mainly for the visuals  br    br    ,0
this movie should not be watched as it was meant to be a flop . ram gopal verma first wanted to make this a remake of classic bollywood movie  sholay   but after having problems with the original makers decided to go ahead with the project and . . . i guess leave all the good parts of the movie  acting  script  songs  music  comedy  action etc  out and shoot the movie just because he already happen to hire the crew . waste of money  waste of time . after making movies like rangeela  satya  and company he pulled a coppola  godfather  on us what were you thinking rgv  anyways  the story is  though hard to follow  is almost like the old sholay . ajay devgan playing heero  beeru  sholay  and ajay  new kid on the block playing ajay  jay  sholay  . both  bad yet funny  friends help a cop capture a bad guy first . later in the movie  now retired cop hires them as personal security and safeguarding from the hands of a very most wanted bubban played by amitabh bachan . in case you haven  t been watching bollywood movies  the good guys win in the end . there i just saved you  precious hours of your life   ,0
well i wasn  t sure what the film was going to be like as i had only seen a little clip but i was thinking its going to be good and i was right i watched it twice on the day i got it and well it is my favourite film .  br    br   i think alison lohan played the part of beth really well she is such a grate actress and the writer must have gone into a lot of research to find out about bulimia although the ending when beth is in the hospital an has  horus observation after meals because iv been told like  house is ok and also that hospitals doesn  t help bulimics as iv been told which is probably why i  m still at home even tho my sister and mum would like to have me hospitalised as i to have bulimia but this is a grate film i recommend it to any one with or with out an eating disorder or for people who know some one with eating disorders as it can let them in to the lives of a bulimic person and see the world how they do a bit over all a grate film and i recommend it to any one and any type of person  ,1
what happened  those were the first words to come to mind after this awful movie finished for the first and last time on my computer screen . nightmare on elm st . had gone noticeably downhill after it  s cult  classic of a first film  but i doubt anybody expected this horrible aberration . nobody expected this cosmic joke of a film  and nobody is more distraught about it than i am .  br    br   this is by far the worst anoes film of the lot . it doesn  t seem too bad at the beginning  with a genuinely creepy intro and a rather elongated shower scene featuring alice . but then we hit rock bottom right at the beginning with bad acting and a jumbled sequence of events . i mean  sure  freddy movies are supposed to be dreamlike and creepy  but this one is like a train  wreck in it  s poor sequencing of events and awful plot setup . it feels like you  re coming down with a terrible headache  not like you  re getting scared . so the directing totally fails . none of the suspense and well crafted horror from previous sequels is found here  and even the death scenes are mostly just crass and moronic  the death by food especially   except for that one cool scene that  s crafted like a comic book battle . that  s why this movie gets a point .  br    br   the storyline . . . lame  lame  lame  lame . it was an excuse to gross people out and to make the mpaa mad  and nothing more .  br    br   the acting . . . should i mention how freddy has been turned into a childish boogey  man  like clown figure  how his rebirth scene made him look like a monster out of a  year old  s horror book instead of the foreboding and nightmarish dream killer we  ve all known and loathed since the first film  that arm waving and stupid chuckling as he appeared again . . . ugh . and his one liners  too . throughout the whole movie  they suck . badly . a grade  schooler could come up with funnier stuff then the vomit freddy spews throughout the   minute duration of the film . hell  a chimpanzee could come up with much funnier lines than what freddy  s been told to say here . who wrote the script for this  this movie is really irritating  too . it seems so pointless . like a gnat buzzing around your head  a gnat that just won  t go away . freddy is just an annoyance now . we  ve seen him so many times before . this one  s nothing different  and a lot of the time you just want him to take his awful one  liners and get off your tv screen . alice  instead of the thoughtful and quiet girl from the last movie  seems annoying and very shallow  and this is obviously due to the horrible  horrible script this movie was fitted with . lisa wilcox may be a great actor  and sometimes it shines through the cracks here  but she can  t save this movie . the other actors just suck  mostly .  br    br   the last   or   minutes of freddy  s existence in this film are awful and embarrassing . i hope englund was ashamed of this . who wants to see freddy running around like a mutated gorilla with his limbs stretched out  laughing like a cartoon villain  this movie destroyed anything positive i felt for the nightmare series . i can  t ever watch them again without this image running through my head of the mangled cartoon abomination that krueger became . he was slowly becoming a jokey  retarded pop culture icon  but this is the lowest of the low . this is rock bottom . nobody will ever take freddy krueger seriously again after seeing this film . he  s naught but a joke  a clown that is long overdue for retirement . pathetic .  br    br   of all the movies i could hate  why did it have to be nightmare on elm st  a series which i once adored and liked a lot  the dream child represents the death of a legend  and the shattering of any hope i had in the nightmare on elm st . series . freddy would go on to continue his downward spiral into clown status in the next installment  freddy  s dead  which was more entertaining than this was  actually   and then he would go on to bring down the mood in freddy vs jason  and finally he would putter out into nothing  which is for the best .  br    br   i know this has mostly been a rant about why freddy sucks now  but this movie is overall  horrible  and one of the worst movies ever made . not recommended to anyone  and even anoes completionists won  t want to see this one again .  ,0
i actually went to see this film in a theater  but what a complete waste of time and money  bad acting  i  m sorry to say  did not help to enjoy this rather sticky screenplay .  br    br   some friends told me to go and see this film  since james redfield  the author of the book  was very heavily involved in the screenplay . they had really enjoyed the book  so the movie just had to be perfect . well maybe i had my hopes up a bit too high  but i absolutely hated this movie  it was predictable  too sweetish to a point that i actually left i had to vomit and worst of all there is going to be a sequel  do the world a favor and stop this abominable crusade .  ,0
i won  t spend a lot of time nor energy on this comment . i just want to add it because all the comments were so positive i felt like i just had to let people know that not everyone is so thrilled  let alone intellectually provoked by this attempt at creating a captivating philosophical cinematic enigma . some scenes seemed promising  playing with visual dimensions  but couldn  t hold up the rest . i felt like i was stoned for the first time again  having semi  philosophical conversations with fellow adolescents .  br    br   what a futile attempt to raise dutch cinema to new heights . i  d rather watch jesus is een palestijn  without all the pretentions and with straight forward humor  also raising questions about life and the realities we create for ourselves .  br    br   gert de graff is not jean  luc godard or tarkovsky and appearantly never will be .  ,0
this movie was a brilliant concept . it was original  cleverly written and of high appeal to those of us who aren  t really  conformist  movie pickers . don  t get me wrong  there are some great movies that have wide appeal  but when you move into watching a movie based on  everyone else is watching it   you know you  re either a tween or don  t really have an opinion . this had a lovely subtle humor  despite most people probably looking only at the obvious . the actors portrayed their characters with aplomb and i thought there was a lot more  personal  personality in this film . has appeal for kids  as well as adults . esp . nice to find a good movie that  s not filled with sexual references and drug innuendos  a great film  not to be overlooked based on public consumption . this one is a must buy .  ,1
a bit slow and boring  the tale of an old man and his wife living a delapidated building and interacting with a fixed cast of characters like the mailman  the brothers sitting on the porch  the wealthy cigar smoking man . the photography of the river is marvelous  as is the interior period decoration . if you like decoration of banana republic stores  this is a must .  ,1
the violent and rebel twenty  five years old sailor antwone fisher  derek luke  is sent to three sessions for evaluation with the navy psychiatrist dr . jerome davenport  denzel washington   after another outburst and aggression against a superior ranked navy man . reluctant in the beginning of the treatment  he gets confidence in dr . davenport and discloses his childhood  revealing painful traumas generated in his foster house . meanwhile  he meets cheryl smolley  joy briant   and they fall in love for each other . resolving his personal problems  antwone becomes a new man . this true familial drama is a touching and positive story of a man who finds a friend and is sent back to a regular life . the direction of denzel washington is excellent  making sensitive  attractive and with good taste  a story about child abuse . in the hands of another director  it might be a very heavy story . my vote is eight .  br    br   title  brazil    voltando a viver    returning to live    ,1
there is something special about the austrian movies not only by seidl  but by spielmann and other directors as well . this is the piercing sense of reality that never leaves the viewer throughout the movie . hundstage is no exception . this effect is achieved not only by the depicted stories but also by actors playing . in hundstage i have never had the feeling that these are actors playing  but real people instead . so real is the visceral feeling of the viewer . . . almost as if the grumpy pensioner or lonely lady in the movie are living below you in your block .  br    br   any person living in vienna can without any doubt painfully recognize the people in the movie with their meckern  sudern  complaining   their hidden sexual urges and the prolo macho guys . this is further reinforced by the viennese dialect which is  according to many  especially made for complaining as a way of life . a special parochialism and arrogance typical for vienna are also very well portrayed .  br    br   the viennese suburbs have a vivid presence in the movie with their stupor and drowsiness where nothing happens . moreover  they have been turned into a celebration of materialism with shopping malls and huge department stores . inbetween are the houses of the people where they indulge into what they reckon is pleasure  giving activities  trying to stay in touch with their human selves  yet in vain . the examples are the sexual game of the old lady with the men which bordered on rape  the prolo guy losing his nerves and hitting his girlfriend and the young woman who hitchhikes and irritates her drivers .  br    br   the film has no soundtrack as it concentrates on the normality  abnormality of its images only . another typical feature of seidl  and other austrian directors  is his showing of disturbingly sexual images . these include the stripping of the old woman for her husband  the sexual scenes in the bath  the sexual game of the lady with the two men in her apartment  etc .  br    br   in hundstage seild has portrayed the lives of people who eventually may be as much viennese as they could be citizens of paris  new york or madrid . the viewers should not despise or feel pity for the viennese in the movie as they themselves could become victims of the same human estrangement and alienation  albeit in different circumstances . in the end  i believe seidl  s film is a warning to us about the terrible state of human relationships so brutally revealed in hundstage . and if the viewer does not succumb to the reasons for this evil transformation  seidl has achieved his goal .  ,1
the actual crime story at the core of in cold blood might seem a little  tame  for those who are weened on the classic serial killer stories  gein  bundy  dahmer   or just the more notorious cases out in hollywood  oj  manson  . the essential facts in the case don  t amount to anything terribly convoluted perry smith and dick hickock  here played by robert blake and scott wilson respectively  met by some luck  conspired to rob a man  s farmhouse safe out in kansas  and after killing a family of four with a shotgun and dagger came away with   dollars . aside from their returning to the us after fleeing briefly to mexico  there isn  t a whole lot of mystery to the resolution either . they were caught by some stroke of ironic chance  a cop followed them and stopped them for having a stolen car after smith and hickcock helped out a boy and his old man collecting bottles for change   and sentenced to hang by the neck until dead . the story ended in     .  br    br   but it  s the handling of the story  moments of moot  the performances  a pure cinematic touch that brooks and his absolutely marvelous  the late  great  dp conrad hall provides in crisp widescreen black and white  and a storytelling style that feels realistic without going into too much naturalism or too much melodrama  save perhaps for near the end  which is pitch perfect  . the air of tragedy hangs over the story  and not so much because of the killings themselves  no matter how brutal they are as the  third  man that is conjured up  as the narrator observes  by smith and hickcock teaming up  but because of the inevitability of the story . you feel somehow for these criminals  who in any other hands would be just be conventional figures or something out of a b  movie . these aren  t good people  but they aren  t necessarily monsters either  at least all the way through .  br    br   it  s also an excellent  road  movie  as we see smith and hickcock on the road down to the clutter residence  the actual night  time scene of the crime taking place late in the film   then on to mexico  then back to america towards las vegas . we get to soak in the personalities of these two  probably even more than that of the police detectives who at first have no leads and then finally get a break with an inmate . it  s actually kind of disturbing to get this close to these two  sort of akin to the aimless quality of malick  s badlands characters   and it  s also a sign of daring for the period . there  s no sermonizing  like  he did this because of that and this or the other .  we see how smith had an abusive  psychotic father  but that smith loved and hated him . the complexity there is too much for the movie  maybe even too much for capote  s book  which  i should confess  i  ve still yet to read  though i plan to  . and we see hickcock is this creature of slick confidence  i . e . getting the suit and other things with bad checks   but without any deep  rooted explanation to it all .  br    br   the streak of fatalism in in cold blood is some of the starkest of the   s  and it  s the luck of brooks to have its stars as blake in his top  of  the  pops performance  this and lost highway  oddly enough considering his real life saga in recent years  his quintessential pieces of work   and wilson  s breakthrough before becoming a character actor . while they  re surrounded by fine supporting work  they themselves are eerily absorbing  driven more or less by greed and fantasies of escapism with treasure  and staying pretty much grounded in their situation through the death row and on through their ends . is this a morale of the story  if there could be one  that it  s more horrifying to confront the possibility that those who kill can  t be classified  of good vs evil getting smudged  smith apologized for his crime before being hung  and he points out   but to who   this is a story bound to give the most hardened fans of true  crime the bonafide chills  and it  s quite possibly the best american film of     .  ,1
i had the tv on for a white noise companion and heard      for a fully furnished apartment  so i ran into the tv room expecting another    s flick and got much more . luckily  i could rewind to the beginning  dvr buffer  and hit the record button to watch it entirely .  cinemax uncut and in hd no less   aside from some holes in the story and intermittent improbable dialog  events  this is an effective thriller worthy of your time to watch . pretty creepy and progressive at times beverly d  angelo  s character masturbates in front of alison parker  played adroitly by cristina raines  parker stabs  in very gory fashion  her father  an explicit menage a trios scene .  don  t let the kids watch  the film is totally    s full of bad clothes  polyester suits and tacky ascots  and decor  bad hair  over bloated music score  and familiar looking cinematography . the cast is excellent  take a second on this film  s home page to check it out . it was a surprise to see christopher walken  jerry orbach and jeff goldblum so young . sylvia miles  always wonderfully creepy  enjoy   ,1
my husband is a huge robin williams fan . i like him too  but have generally found that he should  stick to what he does best  and focus on comedic roles . my thoughts were confirmed with this movie . i was completely bored throughout the entire film . the story was predictable . i realize it was inspired by a true story . but  my guess is that there could have been some suspense or intrigue even while maintaining truth in the story . none of the characters were well developed . there was a side story about the main character and his partner . this relationship could have been explored further . more important  though  would have been a deeper exploration of the mother of the  boy  . her psychological profile would have been interesting to delve into . she obviously has a long history that was not touched upon except in the most superficial way . if my husband wasn  t such a huge williams fan  we would have left   minutes into it . too bad i can  t get my    or  hours back .  ,0
henri verneuil represented the commercial cinema in france from          . always strong at the box  office  and usually telling dramatic and suspenseful tales of casino robberies  mafia score  settling and world war ii battles  verneuil could be counted on to give us two solid hours of entertainment on saturday night . he worked with the cream of the male actors of his day gabin  belmondo  fernandel  delon  sharif  anthony quinn . i . . . comme icare is the only time he directed yves montand . it  s an oddly static film  taking place mainly in offices and conference rooms  containing not one chase scene and hardly any violence .  br    br   montand gives a good performance  if somewhat dry  and he is well supported by the other actors . i couldn  t help wondering what costa  gavras could have done with this story  on the basis of z  the lambrakis assassination  and l  aveu  the torture of artur london in czechoslovakia by stalinists  .  ,1
this is a very amusing and sometimes quite creepy anthology  that if a bit short in the screenwriting department  more than makes up for the shortcoming in the acting  location work and overall exuberance . the best episodes of this are the first with denholm elliot playing a horror writer stalked by a character from his novel in the works  a perfect example of the acting pulling this out of the merely pedestrian   the third  with christopher lee as a man terrified of his own daughter and the final episode with the late great jon pertwee as a pompous horror film star who gets more than just a new role on his latest project . the dialogue between pertwee and ingrid pitt is sparkling and inspired  both obviously relishing the opportunity to really ham it up  cushing is typically good in the weakest segment  which certainly isn  t helped by the fact that the wax figure of the woman he  s obsessed with down at the local wax museum  is anything but  beautiful  as we are told to believe she is  someone of shocking beauty was needed and instead we  re given a woman with a jaw of a turtle . minor quibbles aside this movie and it  s wonderful country house setting is one to catch when you can .  ,1

i don  t know why the critics trashed this movie . i hardly ever agree with them anyway .  br    br   the movie could have been a little scarier  i don  t usually go to horror movies  i even had to psych myself up to see it in the daytime . i needn  t have bothered     the cinema was full of kids too  heh    . . . liam was great as always . i also liked catharine zeta jones  theo  and lili taylor  eleanor  nell   br    br   the house was very gothic and beautiful in a spooky way . the special and sound effects were awesome . i also loved the music score  particularly the gentle tunes for eleanor and her journey to save the children  how she grew out of her stagnant routine and life and finally gain her power  peace and freedom .  ,1

deanna durbin  then   and just under contract to mgm  made a short feature in     which paired her with judy garland  a year younger  in the first film for both of them . louis b . mayer then decided he didn  t need two competing young singers  placed his bet on garland and let durbin go . universal immediately signed durbin  rushed her into three smart girls and rewrote the screenplay to pump up her part . she  s billed last  but with the typographic equivalent of neon lights around her name . universal was convinced durbin would be a smash  and they were right . three smart girls is less a musical and more a screwball comedy  and durbin    when the movie was released  carries it with aplomb . she  s penny craig  and she and her older sisters  joan and kay  are determined to save their father  who had divorced their mother  from the clutches of an elegant gold digger with a fierce mother . they talk their way from switzerland  where they live  to new york city  where their father lives . they plan not just to break up their father  s wedding but to reunite their father with their mother  who after ten years apart still loves the guy . is there any doubt that durbin will sing a song or two in her warm  luscious soprano  nope . is there any doubt the girls will succeed . . . with kay and joan finding love and matrimonial material along the way  nope  again . years later durbin was quoted as saying that she couldn  t keep playing little miss fixit forever . she was right  of course  but in three smart girls  her first feature movie  she has little miss fixit down pat . durbin is funny  determined  resourceful  energetic and  of all things  natural . her personality is so genuine that it makes this comedy   a mix of farce  confusion  good intentions and cheerful avarice   downright endearing .  br    br   durbin carries the movie with ease . it  s a lot of fun watching her hold her own against the likes of binnie barnes as donna lyon  the woman with her hooks in penny  s rich father  played by charles winninger  who was no slouch at stealing scenes  either . alice brady  who played the dithering matron in my man godfrey  plays donna lyons  mother  who is even more of a gold digger than her daughter . the last of the accomplished farceurs is ray milland as lord michael stuart  who through a contrived and amusing mix  up is mistaken for mischa auer .  br    br   three smart girls holds up well as a light  weight and amusing comedy of manners and mix  ups . so does deanna durbin as a brand  new star  who with her huge success saved universal  s bacon .  ,1
if you merely look at the cover of this movie  it  s cool . don  t . the movie itself put me to sleep . it was slow paced  had minimal violence and a poor use of suspense . the acting was bottom feeder material and the plot  while it would  ve been cool for a different movie  was poorly shown here . they even kill the only likeable character in the whole film  i give it a  out of   because the only thing that was good was the plot twist at the end . other than that  you might want to save yourself from this movie trash .  ,0
only after some contemplation did i decide i liked this movie . and after reading comments from all the other posters here  and thinking about it some more  i decided that i liked it tremendously . i love american films  probably because they are so narrative . they usually have a well  defined beginning  middle  and end .  presque rien   on the other hand  makes no such attempt . i disagree with other posters that say it  s  too artsy .  in every way  this film is meant to evoke your sense memories . so often throughout the film you feel like you  re there . . . you feel the summer sun  the breezes  the heat  the winter chill  the companionship  the loneliness  etc .  etc .  br    br   in every way  the director pulls you into the lives of the characters  which is why so many people feel so strongly that the movie disappointed them . after i finished watching it  i felt the same . but upon some reflection  i recognized that this is how the movie had to be the  story  isn  t the narrative  it  s the emotions you  the viewer  feel .  br    br   the lighting  scenery  and camera angles immerse you in the scenes  they  re rich  exquisite  and alive with detail and nuance . although i normally cannot countenance films without a fully developed plot  after all  isn  t a movie  supposed  to tell a story   this film is definitely one of my new favorites .  ,1
here italy  i write from venice  . why cancelated  the abc should have given it a chance to build an audience . the cast  w  hope davis  campbell scott  erika christensen  zoe saldana  jay hernandez and bridget moynahan  is one of the best i  ve seen in recent . we need more shows like this that makes viewers feel like they are intelligent individuals not mindless drones . i hope that abc will reconsider its decision or another station will pick it up . please sign online petition to abc http   www . petitiononline . com  gh      petition . html please sign online petition to abc http   www . petitiononline . com  gh      petition . html  ,1
evidently when you offer a actor enough money they will do anything . i am not sure how much john rys  daves got  but most of the money he made should go to his fans as an apology for even being associated with such a rotten movie . the special effects were worse then effects from the      s b movies and the acting of the rest of the cast was even worse . as to how bad the acting was a child gave the second best performance in my opinion . the english was terribly accented and i think no one could really even speak english they just memorized how the words should sound instead of memorizing the script and trying to make their character both  life  like  and real .  ,0
izzard was both hysterical and insightful in his humor . he definitely represents his own little niche in the comedic world .  br    br   it  s a pity more americans won  t see this stand  up routine due to its pal  only availability .  ,1
i found it hard to like anyone in this film . the central characters  lindy and michael chamberlain  whose daughter disappears during a night out in the australian outback  are not bad people  but then surely not all  or even most  of the scores of people we see throughout this movie would be bad if we knew them better . but though we are as sure as the film wants us to be of the guilt or innocence of the chamberlains from the start of their life  s tragic disarray  the film takes on a more or less sociological perspective pertaining to gossip  news media  crowds  mobs and assumptions . it  s not a movie about the degenerate society of australia in particular it  s merely an account of a true story that happened there . society en masse is much less evolved than the individual feels ensured that we are .  br    br   when a warden insists upon killing all of an aborigine  s dogs because of the unverified action of a single wild dog  when a randomly ruined life spins even further out of control owing to the majority of magazines  newspapers and tv programs distorts the tragic truth to a level of drama that provokes its consumers into a frenzy  there is no sign of empathy or even any kind of looking outside of one  s own unaware perceptions  influenced left and right by the vigorous hearsay and vibes of those who surround one  s life . the reason i appreciate the film is because it turns the focus inside out  from the victims to the masses .  br    br   the evidence against lindy chamberlain aside  suspicion was jet  fueled mostly by a virtue of hers . to the public eye  she did not seem sufficiently distraught by the death of her baby daughter . why was she able to keep her cool  even a sort of aloofness let alone holding her head up  for tv and the press  how much of the downward spiral could  ve been prevented had she behaved more to the public  s liking in the media  meryl streep  one of  if not the  greatest actress working today  may not give a performance that particularly stands out  and frankly neither does any other actor  or department of film  making . but she  and the screenwriters  do understand lindy . what is infuriating is that it  s not that difficult . apparently  she was not naturally prone to showing emotion in public in any case . whether or not she is approachable as a lovable character in the immediate sense  we are naturally prone to sympathize with her situation .  br    br   whether or not her performance is as immediately gratifying as sophie  s choice  the devil wears prada  angels in america or other such work  it is a triumph . it is difficult enrapture an audience when you purposely deny them insights into yourself . she frustrates us because we don  t know what she  s thinking or feeling . it took me awhile to feel endeared toward her  but this is the movie  s way of suggesting the reaction of the public  s attention .  br    br   she is married to a pastor  and they both practice a religion that is in a small minority and thus misinterpreted by most . initially  they react to their loss as if to be reconciling themselves to god  s will  kick  starting a rumor mill generating the notion that their daughter  s death was some sort of ritual killing on their part . whatever happened to the little girl  her parents were part of a margin with whom most of the media  s intake didn  t immediately identify  so the first inclination was to go after them like a pack of hungry . . . well . . .  br    br   meryl streep and sam neill are constantly on screen  but the australian public plays the real leads here . like punctuation for each plot advance  director fred schepisi cuts away from restaurant to tennis court to dinner party to saloon to office  where the public tries lindy and gets carried away into their own passionate projections .  br    br   this golan  globus docudrama is not particularly memorable . the setting  s atmosphere doesn  t give a pleasurable enough compensation for the fact that no performance or facet of production stands out . but it is very successful as an indictment of the collective conscious of the public .  ,1
about halfway through  i realized i didn  t care about these characters in the least however  i watched a bit more anyway . regrettably  i came back the next day and finished it . i shouldn  t have bothered .  br    br   if you know anything about the film beforehand  you know that the lead character will be a plane crash survivor  and the title gives you a pretty good idea of what  s gonna happen afterward  he  s gonna get on the phone and call people about it  that was almost as bad as  snakes on a plane   another bad aviation catastrophe flick  .  br    br   i realize this is an old film  and the acting style in those days was much less naturalistic than today . but even by those standards  the acting was embarrassing . these weren  t characters  they were stereotypes . i suspect this movie was  more than anything  an attempt by bette davis to help her husband  s  gary merrill  career . to no avail however  i have seen oak trees display more genuine emotion than he did .  br    br   davis  playing the happy cripple  i . e .  a non  glamorous role  was probably looked on as an edgy and bold career move . it wasn  t . it was just boring . she was a kind of tiny tim in the film  making trask  merrill  s character  see the truth about love and forgiveness  although she was less winsome than tiny tim   calmly dispensing wisdom about life and relationships without a hint that her beloved husband had just died .  br    br   the final scene  where trask calls his wife back in iowa to reconcile  was so affected and over  acted on both ends of the phone line  i almost cringed . i had to remind myself that these people actually got paid for what they were doing in this film .  br    br   i noticed a lot of people seem to have enjoyed this movie . if you found it uplifting  that  s great . but frankly  i just found it bad . there are plenty of old movies from the golden age of hollywood that were far better written and acted .  ,0
being a film studies graduate i would like to think that i have seen a diverse range of films  some good and some bad  but i would have to say that  summer rain  is by far the worse film i have ever seen  i chose the film in the hope that it was going to be a great british classic such as  secrets and lies  or  lockstock  but oh no this was so bad that my flat mates and i ended up laughing and cringing at the ridiculous acting and cheesy script  reminded me of a bad  theatre in education  school production  . the main characters michelle and gary began to annoy us from the start .  michelle  the main character who lives with her two friends has the type of face that you would never get tired of slapping and gary was so wet  he kept breaking down in tears every  minutes  that by the end of the film i really didn  t give a damn about either of them . all i could think was  i paid   for this pile  . i have never written a review before but after watching this film it has spurred me on to warn people of this disastrous production . so please avoid at all costs . thanks for reading .  ,0
unlike other commentaries  i found this film fascinating  even with all its faults and the zombie acting of some of the actors .  br    br   being a technologist  i found that the experiments interesting and the hardware realistic . although the reading of people minds via computer sounds fantastic  experiments are being conducted now to do just this . i will note that this experiments are in a very early stage  with results so far not favorable .  br    br   the characters in the movie are well cast . the girl  although overacting a bit  looks suitable dumb . the truck driver is a a ringer for real truck drivers . the minister conveys doubt at first   the principal investigator tells the minister that him  the minister   is not sure whether he believes that god created man or that man created god . but the minute when the chips are down  he falls back on his faith . only the phd plays the zombie . the secrets that they harbor are suitably appropriate for their characters . in the face of death they react as real human beings would .  br    br   the movie is a warning against the dangers of unlimited surveillance by government . as strictly a thriller  the movie does not have enough thrills . as a scientific exercise with philosophical underpinnings it is fascinating .  ,1
i didn  t even want to watch this movie after reading maltin  s review and     star rating . i watched it anyway on the advice of my son and found it much better than i expected . i would give it     stars out of a  star system . you have to watch the movie more than once to understand it all . if you don  t know much about religion  you will miss a lot . i graduated from high school the year the movie was made  so maybe i can relate to it better . yes  there is some pretension in the movie and it  s weird to some extent  but that was the   s so what do you expect . i can see why people might not like the movie however  i cannot understand people saying it is boring . the movie is anything but boring . you will either hate it or love it . if you find it boring  you are probably brain dead .  ,1
remarkable  disturbing film about the true  life  senseless  brutal murder of a small  town family  along with the aftermath  and examination of the lives of the killers  dick hickok and perry smith .  br    br   no matter how much time goes by  or how dated this film may look  it still resonates the utter incomprehensibility of criminal acts such as this .  br    br   this really traces multiple tragedies the tragedy  brutality and senselessness of the murder of the clutter family  a decent farm family in small  town holcomb  kansas and the wasted  brutal and sad lives of hickok and smith .  br    br   an interesting point is made in the film that neither of these two immature  scared  petty criminals would have ever contemplated going through with something like this alone . but  together  they created a dangerous  murderous collective personality one that fed the needs and pathology of each of them . they push each other along a road of  proving  something to each other . that they were man enough to do it  to carry it out neither wants to be seen as too cowardly to complete their big  score   an unfortunate and dangerous residue of the desolate lives they led . these were two grown  up children  who live in a criminal  s world of not backing down from dares who constantly need to prove manhood and toughness . in this instance  these needs carried right through to the murder of the clutters .  br    br   the film contains a somewhat sentimentalized look at the clutter family  but the point is made . these were respected  law  abiding  small  town people  who didn  t deserve this terrifying fate . the movie also gives us a sense of the young lives of hickok and smith . perry smith  whose early life was filled with security and love  but watched in horror as alcohol took his family down a tragic path . hickok  poor and left pretty much to his own devices  not able to see how he fit in  using his intelligence and charm to con everyone he came into contact with .  br    br   an interesting  and maybe the first  look at capital punishment  and what ends we hope to achieve . is this nothing more than revenge killing for a murder that rocked a nation at a time when we had not yet had to fully face that there might be such predators among us  or does putting these guys at the end of a rope truly provide a deterent to the childish and brutal posturing of men like these  is it possible to deter men who live lives of deceit  operating under the radar  believing they fool everyone they come into contact with  to be deterred  you must believe it  s possible you will be caught . is it possible to deter these men who believe they are too clever to be caught   who have committed hundreds of petty crimes  and got away with them  this was supposed to be a  cinch    no witnesses  .  br    br   when caught  hickok finds he can  t charm and con the agents the way he had department store clerks . smith  who believes he deserves such a fate anyway  who seemed to be the only one who truly grasped the gravity of what they had done  willingly tells the story when he learns that hickok has cowardly caved in . hickok blinked first . a silly game of chicken between two immature  emotionally damaged  dangerous men .  br    br   fascinating psychological thriller  telling a story of a horrendous crime in this nation  s history . stunning portrayals by robert blake and scott wilson . these roles made their careers .  ,1

sophmoric this film is . but  it is funny as all get out . it shows the  boys locker room mentality  being played by the  other side  . it is good to see such tides turned and how silly they are . but that  s probably not news to most women   cause  just ask one    they  ve heard  em all before  .  br    br   watch it with a small group or party of mixed gender and   .   of the room will laugh for  hours straight . and the other  .   . . . can you ever really please them   ,1
wendy wu homecoming warrior has a very good  strong plot but is ruined by cheesy details throughout the movie . i am a younger teenager and didn  t enjoy this movie very much . i thought the effects were horrible  but they might seem entertaining to younger children . the matrix moves ruined the action  you know that it was absolutely fake . then there was the yen lo  an evil spirit who temporarily possesses random people and homecoming in which wendy was striving to win . it all ends like a typical feel good movie when wendy and her buddhist monk cousin shen defeat yen lo  and destroy him forever  in the end . so wendy learns a lesson . . . blah  blah  blah . i  m ready for the next dcom .  ,0
this is a well made informative film in the vein of pbs frontline . the problem is  frontline already did this piece and managed to bring l . paul bremer in to tell his side of the story . more troubling is the fact that the director of the film  charles ferguson   a former think tank wonk  was a war supporter until the occupation went south . what did he think would happen   br    br   the invasion of poland went really well too until it was messed up by those pesky nazis . and that is what this film feels like   an apology for occupation rather than a deconstruction of the act of war itself .  br    br   ferguson seems to suggest that the war could have been run better   as if any war can be better .  ,0
after enjoying this show for years  i use to dream of being able to see them all again and share them with my grandchildren . i am so happy to pay a small amount for the memories that i have found recorded on dvd . florida was a caring mother with a loving hard working husband  one spoiled beautiful daughter and two sons as different as day and night . michael  the baby son is a freedom walker and jj is a clown . i know many afro  americans disliked this show  but i know many can relate and should have accepted it as it was . my heart was sad when i learned that ester rolle had passed . tyler perry is now the leading writer actor of today and i support his work  but not as much since he made such cruel mocking of rolle in one of his plays . no one should have to hear ugly things about physical appearance . the show started getting less interesting when daddy james died . it picked up a bit when florida remarried  but slumped when she took an absence from the show . in all  the show was great and again i am pleased to own copies of part of my past . i do try to keep up with the work of the former stars of good times  and i must say  they are one group who has not been wiped up and down with rumors . i think children of today will enjoy this show and i have no problem sitting and watching with children . congrats to the writer  crew  and stars for years of renewed memories of a time that i can once again enjoy without having to skip scenes .  br    br   ok so i watch the shows over and over . lately i have noticed thing that has made me rethink the series  but not dislike them . i think florida was a bit harsh when it came to money that the children made . not that the children did not need supervision  but it was done in a way that makes florida  s mothering different . the scenes where florida had to speak about how other people were not very good looking bothers me now . when james was alive  the show made a big thing out of james wanting his own fix  it shop  but never lived to see his family out of the projects  but florida marries someone who owns a fix  it shop . a bit of a slap in the face to an actor who should have ended his time on good times showing that he accomplished all he strove for . lastly  as i watch the shows  i see the series going in to overtime and being renamed  jj  . to be truthful  after james left everything mostly centered around jj . not a bad thing  just a noticeable thing . i would not trade my dvd  s for any amount of money  but time  maturity and experience began to guide your eyes after a while .  ,1
astounding . . . . . this may have been a poor attempt at remaking the already recreated omen movie  but i sure enjoyed it .  br    br   that last man who commented is a fool  this movie was one of a kind  and the music dark  jerry goldsmith himself  would had applaud this movie .  br    br   great recommendations from myself to watch or buy this film .  br    br   i collect horror movies and soundtracks  so listen to what i have to say  not that other idiot .  br    br   there is only one thing that do not fascinate me  the endings .  br    br   according to prophecy it is all inaccurate  including final conflict  and left behind .  br    br   but my conclusion being . . . . there great movies . . . and should be seen  before the great depression falls upon us  and before the democrats take over the presidency too .  br    br   so signed . . . . jacob eder . . . a farmer  with a mastermind .  ,1
a film that dramatized an understandable reluctance to face the inevitable coming of the the second world war  when a spanish republican  sent by his soon to be overthrown government   charles boyer  infiltrates himself into england looking for support for his cause by trying to influence wealthy mine owners not to sell coal to the fascists back in spain . he upsets the locals  getting convincingly beaten in one scene  and later in the film facing an angry crowd of miners who see him as yet another threat to their shaky livelihood . notwithstanding socio  economic hierarchy  xenophobia  and world politics  this film expertly delves into a dark and suspenseful intrigue involving unfaithful compatriots played by katina paxinou and peter lorre  and is expertly filmed in numerous darkly lit scenes set in a dreary hotel by james wong howe  and manages more than once to get under your skin .  ,1
one thing i  m sure everyone who has seen this film will agree on is that it is very creepy . the other films in polanski  s unofficial trilogy are creepy too  but they are all different in what makes them creepy  but they all roughly deal with the same thing  they all deal with the mind . definitely the staring people are very creepy  each of them sent shivers down my spine that made me incapable of sitting still . again  if you have seen the other two films mentioned  i  m sure you  ll find this quite creepy  because you begin to expect typical polanski traits that you think you have caught onto  he is aware of this and will keep teasing you with simple things  personally every time trelkovsky would slowly turn around i would be bracing myself for a jump  maybe that  s just me  but it felt intended to do that  though it was quite subtle  there is no build up of the music in those moments .  br    br   the acting in this was pretty good  mostly that from polanski of course  the other characters in the film don  t have all that much time to outshine the lead . polanski really proves himself as an all  round great filmmaker  he not only can direct and write great films  but he can actually act too . i don  t think there is any other better person who could have pulled off the trelkovsky character  polanski settled right on in perfectly . i like seeing films where the director is also apart of the main cast  to me it really highlights their fantastic versatility and talent  which i respect greatly .  br    br   one thing i didn  t like about this film is how it was done in english . for those who don  t know  this is a french film  american financed  and as well to make it more commercially successful it was mostly done in english . there are parts which it is very obvious there has been dubbing  and i don  t know why it is  but    of the time when there is a dub they get the complete wrong person to do the dub . there is a women in the film who when she speaks it  s obvious it  s a dub  but they got the most annoying person to do the voice  over  it was seriously pain to my ears to hear her speak  she had the loudest high pitch voice i  ve heard in a while  it almost seemed fake  but i don  t see what the point was  she was a rather small character . i honestly would of preferred if they just left it as it was filmed  parts of it in french and parts of it in english  because the dubbing in this film was a pain and was not near  two completely different films  i know  the high standard of another film that did a similar thing  which was  the good  the bad and the ugly . i realise it  s not a big problem  just when you do realise it  it gets annoying  but i  m sure you won  t sit there the long trying to lip read what they are actually saying  regardless if you know french .  br    br   whats so great about polanski is that he will let you think you know him  that you know his style  which in some aspects you do  but really  you can  t see whats behind that corner . this film is a lot more open to interpretation than the other two films mentioned  which i think really strengthens this one in particular . i personally feel this is the best of the three  i  m unsure which comes next  but they are all relatively close in their level of greatness . the ending is fantastic  it is so easy to dwindle on it for a long time to come and get nowhere . i choose not to think to much on it  just to have my personal opinion and leave it at that .  br    br   i  ve rambled on  and i haven  t really given any insight on what makes this film so great  i don  t think  so i  ll quickly do it here . if you liked repulsion and  or rosemary  s baby  i guarantee you will enjoy this film to say the least . for those who are too unfortunate to have seen either then i recommend you check this film out if your looking for something that is quite a creepy film that is quite intelligent  particularly the end  as well if your looking for something that deals with the mind  paranoia even  though that is better fitted under repulsion .  ,1
  visitor q  is a failed attempt at black comedy which focuses on what might be the world  s most dysfunctional family including physical abuse from beatings to murder to incest to sodomy to necrophilia to a lactating mom who nurses her husband and adult daughter  etc . the film is so outrageous it garnered some critical praise and established a small cult following . however  with home video quality and a slapdash production   visitor q  just doesn  t hold up even as a curiosity . genitals are blurred out and sanitary appliances clearly visible  make  up is awful  and everything else is amateurish at best . a waste of time .  c    ,0

robert culp  they call his character  doctor  . . . i think he  s a vet or something  and family move to an affluent  low  tax  zero  law  enforcement suburb . lantern  jawed culp and his dog are nearly killed when some local idiot neighbor kids get drunk and  go cruising  through his front yard at   mph . he presses charges  which arouses the kids  ire  and suddenly him and his family are the victims of a violent and disturbing prank campaign .  br    br   marilyn manson  er  marlyn mason rather  plays his fretful  boiled  celery wife  who urges him not to use violence against his sneering nemeses  and who really just wants to move somewhere with decent public services . but the system is getting culp nowhere  and he  s not about to leave his house because of some punk kids and their crazy rock and roll music . and we all know what movie people do when the system fails . . .  but this is based on a true story  which makes it even better  .  br    br   it should be noted that while the villainous hooligans do have convenient    s funk  o  matic  teenage  theme music that warns us when they  re up to no good  this film actually ends up treating the age brackets even  handedly  really   . it doesn  t make a big generational thing out of it . kudos for that .  br    br   anyway  if you like dogs  or at least believe in protecting their civil rights  like me   and you like justice  and you like fire  and you like justice for dogs by way of fire  and you think people who skitter nervously out of troubled communities are  too damn soft   then this flick  s ethos is up your alley . no  it  s not really  good   at least not in any widely recognized sense of the word . there  s nothing subtle or understated or clever about it  it  s just sort of a feature  length psa for vigilantism . it does  however  capture the feeling of some memorable scenes in other  beloved works . remember in frank miller  s the dark knight returns when batman leads the mutants on horseback to reclaim gotham city  remember that scene in a christmas story where the kid pounds the bully  s face in  remember how cool that was  or do you just really hate being looked at funny by your neighbors  yeah  mon .  br    br   unfortunately  this was a     made  for  tv movie that i just happened to catch at  am on my local wb affiliate  and it  s probably not destined for dvd release . but after being inspired by this film  do you think i  m gonna just sit here and take it     ,1
the old mill pond is more of a tribute to the african  american entertainers of the    s than any denigration of the entire race  stepin fetchit caricature notwithstanding  . besides who i just mentioned  there  s also frog or fish versions of cab calloway  fats waller  joesphine baker  bill  bojangles  robinson  and louis armstrong . this happy harmonies cartoon from hugh harmon and rudolf ising is very entertaining musically with perfect characterizations all around . they all sound so much like the real thing that half of me thinks they could possibly be . if not  they  re certainly very flattering impersonations . even the lazy  shiftless fetchit characterization gets an exciting workout here when he gets chased by a tiger as  hold that tiger  plays on the score . highly recommended for fans of    s animation and jazz music .  ,1
the melting man . . . a tragic victim of the space race  he perished melting . . . never comprehending the race had long gone by . . .   br    br   a man  burr debenning  burns his hand on the kitchen stove . but instead of screaming something a normal person would scream  he shouts something that sounds like  aaaaatch  kah    this movie you  ve popped in . . . isn  t a normal movie . you  ve just taken your first step into the incredible melting man  the famous late     s gore film featuring rick baker  s wonderful makeup effects . baker was just on the edge of becoming a superstar  and did this at the same time as his famous  cantina aliens  in star wars . for some strange reason  star wars became a household name  and incredible melting man did not .  br    br   it might have something to do with the fact that this movie is just mind  numbingly awful . from the opening credits   starring alex rebar as the incredible melting man  . . . that  s really what it says    to the chubby nurse running through a glass door  to the fisherman  s head going over a waterfall and smashing graphically apart on some rocks  this film provides many  many moments of sheer incomprehensibility .  why did they . . . but how come he . . . why are they . . .   after a while  you give up wondering why and watch it as what it is   a very entertaining piece of garbage .  br    br   an astronaut returns to earth in a melting  radioactive condition he escapes and  his mind disintegrating as well as his body  begins a mad melting killing spree . the authorities quickly decide that the melting man must be stopped  but  probably not wanting to  cause a panic   want him captured as quietly as possible . so they send one guy with a geiger counter after him . wow .  br    br   storywise  surprisingly little happens during the movie . the melting guy wanders around killing people . a doctor searches for him with a geiger counter . various characters are introduced  ask questions  and leave . eventually the doctor catches up with the melting man  but is shot by a security guard for no reason  after he explains that he  s  dr . ted nelson .  the melting man wanders off and finally dissolves into a big puddle of goo . the end .  br    br   it  s so brainless that it somehow ends up being a lot of fun  despite a fairly downbeat ending . supposedly  a widescreen dvd release is planned . a very special movie .  ,1
another comedy about a plucky little country struggling through the jungle of the modern  for the forties  global world with only native wit and pluck to guide them  this is a fine entry in the ealing cannon . terry  thomas sparkles as usual in the lead  as a feckless ministry man led to the brink of disaster when a nation he is supposedly in charge of starts attracting the interest of the world  ian bannen makes a great romantic lead  peter sellers puts in one of his quieter performances as a corrupt politico and the uber  suave john le mesurier plays against type as a rugged revolutionary leader . lots of fun is had by all  especially the viewer perhaps not in the very top echelon of ealing classics  but pretty high up .  ,1
there have been very few films i have not been able to sit through . i made it through battle field earth no problem . but this  this is one of the single worst films ever to be made . i understand whoopi goldberg tried to get of acting in it . i do not blame her . i would feel ashamed to have this on a resume . i belive it is a rare occasion when almost every gag in a film falls flat on it  s face . well it happens here . not to mention the sfx  look for the dino with the control cables hanging out of it rear end       halfway through the film i was still looking for a plot . i never found one . save yourself the trouble of renting this and save   minutes of your life .  ,0
i would reccomend this film to everyone . not only to the fans of the rocker luciano ligabue  but to all film  buffs . because it  s sincere  moving  funny and true . because ligabue is a born storyteller and a film lover  and every frame of his film is made with love and care . because his characters are loved and ask to be loved . because most of the italian debut films are lousy and this one  done by an outsider  is a real joy to watch and to listen at . because stefano accorsi is gorgeous and reminds me of andrea pazienza  who was  like freccia  beautiful and talented and good and lost his life because of the heroin  that ligabue shows as it is  unglamorous and ugly  without indulging in easy moralisms . because it  s a film that speaks to our heart  our ears  our souls . and because i lived the experience of the fm radios and it was exactly like that . thanks  luciano   ,1
this is one very dire production . the general consensus has always been that while princess margaret may have been spoilt and pampered and may have revelled in the excess of luxury at her disposal  she was a very beautiful young woman . here was the production  s weakest point  the actress failed to get that across . it also appeared that the production budget couldn  t stretch to a hairdresser  from the outset  the hair on the princess margaret character had a permanent birds nest in disarray look and looked as if she had been dragged through a bush . the actor playing the duke of edinburgh appeared to have prepared for his role by watching rory bremner imitate prince charles and was farcical .  br    br   the production was a flaw ridden  clich ridden  embarrassing load of rubbish . i think all daily mail readers deserve a free dvd copy for christmas   ,0
i grew up watching full house as a child . i stopped watching it for years  but about two weeks ago i started back watching it again . now my kids watch the show and they love to watch it as well . my kids can  t believe that dj  on the show  and i are the same age .  br    br   i really love the show  because it is a show you can watch with your family . it has good teachings your kids can learn from . also there isn  t any drugs and violence on it . also when the kids  on the show  have a problem they can always open up to their family for help . that  s the message kids should be getting from tv now a days  turn to your family for help  not to drugs . kids should be watching more shows like full house instead of half the mess on tv now a days .  br    br   i also love the show because it makes you laugh and it is down to earth . it talks about real life problems and family matters . there is always a lesson you can learn from the show .  br    br   i vote the show a   .  ,1
fay grim is the continuation of a story begun ten years earlier with hartley  s henry fool . i haven  t seen the earlier film  and i don  t know if that  s a good thing or not . i can only regard the current film on its own merits .  br    br   for most people  hal hartley  s style of film  making is something that you either like or you don  t . his combination of action  drama  absurdity and dry  ironic humour really resonates with me  and fay grim is no exception . it has an air of sharply  written intelligent parody that had myself and many in the melbourne international film festival audience laughing out loud . for the first half of the film it was relentless and delivered with deadpan straightness . it  s a style of humour sadly lacking in cinemas and a welcome relief to the mindless teen comedies that hollywood pumps out like pancakes .  br    br   during the second half of the film  the humour starts to thin as the film morphs into an international espionage  conspiracy thriller . whether this was hartley  s intention or whether he ran out of ideas is not clear  but i think a bit of editing or re  writing to cut fifteen minutes off the film would have maintained the film  s original momentum .  br    br   the performances were generally good  particularly parker posey and jeff goldblum  who had the most screen time . saffron burrows  james urbaniak  carl montgomery and elina lwensohn all played good support roles . the film  s visuals were nice  set in new york  paris  berlin and istanbul  and the music  also by hartley  was good without being intrusive . the film is well  written and i enjoyed this it immensely . if you like hartley  s earlier work  you  ll probably like this .  ,1
a young boy comes into a lot of money and promptly begins to live it up . unfortunately  the man whose money it really is happens to be very bad . he wants his loot back . when he discovers who has the bucks  he begins trying to get it back . he keeps getting foiled by this little kid who is just lucky enough to keep from falling into the evil man  s hands . sounds familiar  i  ll bet . very predictable  not interesting at all . come up with something a bit different  ok guys   ,0
i love this show  it  s sure to be a winner . jessica alba does a great job  it  s about time we have a kick  ass girl who  s not the cutesy type . the entire cast is wonderful and all the episopes have good plots . everything is layed out well  and thought over . to put it together must have taken a while  because it wasn  t someone in a hurry that just slapped something together . it  s a great show altogether .  ,1
  let  s bowl  started out on local television in the twin cities . it came on late at night  something you  d stumble across while channel surfing after your  th bottle of hamm  s .  br    br   even the ads were locally produced  featuring wally outside grumpy  s bar  holding a microphone and stammering nervously    ahh . . . over to you  steve sedahl .  not sure why  but that one always made me laugh .  br    br   there was a bowling contest featured under the guise of settling a dispute between two bowlers  but the game was secondary to the commentary and clips . sedahl played it straight  counter  balanced by rich kronfeld  s bizarre and hilarious  wally hotvedt .  highlights included segments like  how to properly dispose of an old bowling ball   chuck them into a lake  and  tips on dating   where the duo  date  a couple of hookers and wally ends with the bitter complaint   i could have done that myself    br    br   another segment   what the duo did on their days off   featured steve in beer can strewn hovel  pigging out from the fridge while wally struggled to climb the cliffs at taylor  s falls  dressed in his tight pale blue blazer and over  sized headphones . hilarious   br    br   wally  s awestruck comments about  league bowlers   and his struggle to apply the correct euphemism to various splits were also highlights .  br    br    let  s bowl  was picked up by comedy central and had some good moments  but the network never really knew what to do with it  running it during prime time and emphasizing the bowling  competition   which was never the point of the show . the constant commercials interrupted the flow and the side characters  ernie  the pig  butch  etc .  were more distractions than anything else . the whole thing seemed rushed and kind of forced . even jon stewart dissed let  s bowl on the daily show    not enough lame  snide jokes     an ignominious treatment for a show that deserved far better .  br    br   how often does a  let  s bowl  come along in the world of modern television  a locally flavored mix of comedic genius and total crap  the networks have the  total crap  part down cold  but it  s a sad thing to watch them kill such a dark  strange  funny little gem like  let  s bowl .   br    br   here  s hoping they  ll put it out on dvd .  ,1
this is a bit of a first for me  the first time i have ever been disappointed in a tim burton film . pota isn  t a bad film  great sets  costumes and the odd great performance  but it could have been made by any off  the  shelf hollywood director . the pacing was very odd  the last third was just spent waiting for the film to end  by myself and the cast . tim roth was excellent  probably the only pleasure in the film . come back tim .  ,0
mystery men has got to be the stupidest film i  ve ever seen  but what a film  i thought it was fabulous  excellent and impressive . it was funny  well  done and nice to see ridiculous super heroes for a change  and being able to pull it off  this was great  i  ll definitely watch it again   ,1
some funny bits  but come bill  a film  quoting zeitgeist  keep the tv show and the interviews  but a film  i  m probably overreacting but what a unnecessary provoking film . . . i don  t know . i laughed  disagreed  agreed . . . this film is very confusing and inconsistent .  br    br   bill  s a funny guy . . . but also very cocky . . . bill  s rhetoric is similar to bill hicks  a brilliant comedian . but like many comedians  the borderline between comedy and preaching can be annoying . i think that the major problem in this film is his lack of sensibility . this might be just a personal taste  but comedy that constantly demeans somebody cannot be taken as truth . bill is obviously emotionally reactive to religious fundamentalism . i agree with bill that religious fanaticism is not sensible  but the response to it cannot be sensible . it will create unnecessary turmoil . we can do better than just react to fundamentalism . his conclusion is that  we don  t know  and he fervently tries to convince the spectator that nobody knows anything  to the point that the agnostic community has been concerned with his lack of serious research in comparative religion . his humility that he only knows that he doesn  t  is a contradiction as he tries to insist that all religious thought is non  sense .  br    br   i had great trouble seeing bits of zeitgeist  the movie in bill  s film . all the astrotheology  influenced non  sense that simplifies all religions as the same is simply disappointing . zeitgeist has provoked a lot of controversy and has messed up the validity of so much of the valuable religion studies scholarship . it is very sad how wrong facts have been tossed around with no reliable scholarly sources . astro  mystic sources that reduce everything to  the stars say it all  seem to be from the middle ages . this film is a confusing statement from a confused  agnostic  . agnosticism is far more complex and philosophically academic than defending every single issue as  we don  t know  .  br    br   this film is an obvious proof of how postmodernism has been able to oversimplify and generalize major issues in human history .  br    br   watch the film  it has hilarious interviews and bits  but please do not behave like bill . you cannot expect anybody to have a mature conversation if you are making sardonic comments in every other line . his arguing techniques are demeaning and insulting  provoking emotional reactions rather than rational and logical argumentation . . there needs to be a more mature way of dealing with these issues .  ,0
i love this show  it  s like watching a mini movie each week    the first episode was so gripping and terrifying . . . so was part  of the pilot . . . i  m definitely gonna keep tuning into this show  this is the real survivor  i  ve looked at a few of the other comments and i can see that already after just one or two episodes the morons here are already crying wolf . . . sorry if it  s not another reality show  kiddies  there was once a time where there were . . . now brace yourself  actual tv shows  and this one is actually good unlike most of the crappy sitcoms today or the ump  teenth carbon copy of a law  order or nypd blue or csi series they  re dishing out . . . watch this yourself to form your own opinion  don  t take one from the boneheads here   ,1
this is not the worst film i have seen of peter greenaway but it is close . that dishonor goes to the even worse pillow book . this director  s films of  i have seen i find them all to be miserable . like the cook . . .  whatever positive cinematic flourishes he displays  are totally unredeemed by the repugnancy of his material and overall presentation .  ,0
i love this movie  jouvet  arletty  blier  carn . . . almost everything has already been said about the movie  but there is one detail i  d like to shed some light onto no footage of the real  still standing  htel du nord  is it still  i heard it was to be demolished . . .  has been used for the movie  the whole scene has been rebuilt on set  the main reason being that they could not stop the traffic on the st martin canal for several weeks .  ,1
polanski returns to the themes of solitude and madness which he explored to such tremendous effect in repulsion and rosemary  s baby  in the tenant .  br    br   the atmosphere is trademark polanski  dark  brooding  unnerving  but there is something awkward about this movie and i am not sure whether or not it is deliberate .  br    br   sven nykvist  who was responsible for some of bergman  s most beautiful films  doesn  t quite do himself justice here . as his name was one of the things which really attracted me to this movie  i was a little disappointed in how few instances of truly impressive cinematography are in the film .  br    br   the only thing that really lets the movie down is the acting . polanski is certainly not a bad actor  but he seems to have bitten off more than he can chew with the difficult role of trelkovsky . some of the supporting cast are great  notably melvyn douglas as the landlord and shelley winters as the concierge  but others are weak and miscast . it is also hard to get past the fact that all these supposed parisians have american accents .  br    br   quite unexpectedly  there are some fine moments of dark comedy in the film . anyone who has seen the fearless vampire killers knows that polanski is certainly a good comedic actor . however  there are moments when it slips dangerously close to being a parody of itself . trelkovsky  s sudden  and somewhat unexplained   transformation  is more likely to raise giggles than eyebrows  which detracts from what should have been a powerful moment in his psycho  dramatic journey .  br    br   all in all  the tenant is an enjoyable and intriguing experience  if a little too languorous for its own good . there  s a handful of exceptionally chilling moments and a consistently uncomfortable and foreboding atmosphere but this film  while being very good  does not quite hit the mark as successfully as it could have .  br    br   alas  at the end of the day  an  okay  polanski movie is still better than most other  good  movies . definitely worth a watch  just don  t expect to be blown away .  ,1
when i saw the previews for this movie  i didn  t expect much to begin with  around a second rate teen horror movie . but wow  this movie was absolutely awful . and that  s being generous .  br    br   first of all  the casting for the movie was terrible . you feel no sympathy  or for that matter any morbid feeling  for the characters . the acting was so terrible that i was just simply waiting and hoping for the god  awful thing to end .  br    br   secondly  there are points in the movie that had absolutely no relation to the plot whatsoever . can somebody please explain to me why the girlish  looking boy starts screaming  pancakes     at the top of his lungs while going into jackie chan moves i  ve never seen before  and even further biting the guy who has the virus  why does the father of the kid proceed to get angry with the virus  infected guy  and go on a redneck hunting spree to find him  i was left with a feeling of such confusion and utter disbelief that i literally said out loud   where the hell did that come from    br    br   i just simply couldn  t believe what i had seen . i really thought i had seen some bad movies  but i have to say that cabin fever tops them all . this movie made me want to puke and then puke again . then blow my brains out .  br    br   please  save yourself an hour and a half and do something more productive . watching grass grow  perhaps  is a proper alternative .  ,0
the plot of goodnight mr tom on paper makes it seem we are in for a large dose of maudlin  sickly sentiment . but  talented director jack gold is an expert on touching the emotions in the right manner  and it emerges instead as a compelling  deeply moving wartime drama with excellent production and lead performances . one of the best  if not the best tv movies of the      s which possibly would  ve had even greater success if it had been released in the cinemas .  br    br   the evacuation of children to countryside towns and villages in world war ii was of course a common practice  but in the case of the young boy here was doubly important because of a wretched home life in the uk  s capital . the horrors of war on the home front are not drifted over though  and the construction of the film until it  s throat  lumping  misty  eyed ending leaves us with a sense of optimism despite what has happened before . it is almost  but not quite  worthy of comparison with the finale to it  s a wonderful life       . all in all  a modern classic .  ,1
  rating   by the film snob .   see our blog what  to  see  next for details on our rating system .   br    br   here  s a movie that will have you clawing at your own face in an attempt to earn release from the on  screen tedium .  br    br   you  ll not be wringing your hands  nor rolling your eyes  nor sighing into your popcorn . no indeed . for a movie of this averagousity  only clawing at your own face will do .  br    br   when you begin to claw your own face   as begin you must    start in at the lower portion . you  ll need your upper portion  with its handy tear ducts  intact for the truly tear  jerking third act which may bring you to your knees if you haven  t clawed your way clear of the entire theatre by then .  br    br   in a season celebrating joe six  pack and hockey moms as the new gold standard for leadership and foreign diplomacy  permaybe a movie this tedium will be welcomed as a thing that anyone could create . watching it  however  is a much more dangerous undertaking .  br    br   here  s our story . . .  br    br   sidney young  the london publisher of a fourth  tier celebrity  entertainment magazine is just about to see his magazine go under . he needs a miracle  and what he gets is a phone call from new york city  in the usa .  br    br   the publisher of sharp  s magazine  clayton harding  played by jeff bridges  says  come work for me   with his own employees carrying out the fax machine out of his apartment  office in the background  saying  yes  is a no  brainer .  br    br   soon sidney is at work in new york city  doing allllllll the wrong things . his interviews consist of asking broadway musical directors if they are    jewish  and    gay .  br    br   he kills the pet dog of sohpie maes  the industry  s hottest movie star  when she leaves it in the magazine  s offices during a business luncheon .  br    br   this is a spot of bad luck for everyone  for  among other things  sidney imagines that he is in love with maes  before he wakes up to the dunst character .  br    br   worst of all  he totally alienates alison olsen  played by winsome scripting  confusion by kristen dunst   a colleague assigned to show him the ropes of the magazine and the big apple .  we have  of course  been to a movie before  and so we know how this relationship is going to end up . this is therefore why we  ll need intact tear ducts for the movie  s third act .   br    br   the problem with the thing is  the script just never jells  excepting for the one tear  duct set piece in which true love prevails .  br    br   publisher harding is supposed to be a son  of  a  bitch who also wants to just throw the whole job over . the script never comes down firmly on one or the other sides of this dichotomy  however  and bridges is left to twist and waffle in the breeze .  br    br   alison olsen is supposed to despise sidney young  but whenever he comes up to her  as he does constantly  she makes a point of engaging him in conversation  instead of attempting to discourage his existence .  br    br   the  comedy  of early scenes is built around a piglet destroying an expensive hotel room  and then taking the elevator downstairs to urinate on the expensive high heels of a celebrity at a cocktail reception .  br    br   the hot starlet maes confesses that she is attracted to young because he is  wounded .  the character never shows us why he is wounded  however . this is yet another resultant of the movie  s mortally wounded script .  br    br   at one hours and fifty minutes  this thing feels longer  and more deadly  than napoleon  s retreat from moscow . it is uninspiring  unfunny  unredeemable  and not even rentable . run away  ,0
this movie has made me upset  when i think of cat in the hat . im thinking of cat in the hat books . you know  the one from a few years back that parents read to thier children . well  i though that this movie would be a lot like that  but much to my suprise was nothing like the books  insted it is more like young adult humor movie . in one part cat is talking to a gardening tool  hoe  cat talks to it like it is his hoe  agin adult humor  . the naming of his car i all so though was a little untastful for a kids movie . under the rating you  ll find mild cude humor and some double  entendres . i think in short this means adult humor . i wish i could return this movie  wal  mart said they wouldn  t because the movie has been opened . if you are thinking about buying this i suggest that maybe rent before you buy .  ,0

this film is a very funny film . the violence is bad  the acting is . . . well dani  stick to singing or screaming or whatever the hell it is you usually do . the random chicks wearing hardly anything is just to catch sexually  frustrated goth lads in . personally  i think this movie really does suck . the story and characters could be very good  if say the directing  the actors and other little nibby things were made better . but the film is just bad  the only reason why people like this piece of crap is because it has danni in it . this film is possibly the worst b  rate film ever . and  believe me that  s hard to achieve  especially when you  re competing with def by temptation and over crappy excuses for  serious  horror movies . i  m not a cof fan  and so i just see this as another rubbish movie . . . a really bad one . if dani made this as a comedy then  good going him . very well done . over than that though  i rate it low  for it  s crappiness . watch it when you  re in a happy  happy  joy  joy mode so you can laugh at everything or if you  re high on multiple different types of drugs .  ,0
evidently  not many people have seen this movie  because no one is posting any more comments . this is not a movie to be missed . after all  it has won the george peabody award as well as the humanitas award . paul winfield should have won an award for his awesome performance in this movie . eugene logan who was a co  writer on this made for tv movie also was part of another movie on humanity  or loss of it  by being a technical adviser to truman capote  s movie the glass house . this movie is now available on dvd . if anyone is interested  i will post another letter telling how it was that eugene logan came to be the technical adviser to a movie of such an amazing person as truman capote . thanks for reading this and i hope you will find a way to view these two movies .  ,1
some thirty years ago  author numa sadoul published a book length interview with the belgian comic book artist georges remi  better known as herge  the creator of tintin  . this movie catches up with sadoul today as he recalls the interview  while we listen to the cassettes  herge died in      and see some old photos and footage of the man himself . some parts of the interview were not published in the book at the request of herge  and we now know these dealt with his separation from his wife  after he had an affair with one of his collaborators  who years later would become his second wife  . an interesting thing the movie does not address well is the shift in the tintin books from the early rightist and imperialist books  tintin in the congo  tintin in the lands of the soviets  to fairly anti  imperialist books just a few years later  the blue lotus  . on the whole  i come out of this movie knowing a few more things about herge and seeing him as a bit more unlikable than when i come in to the theater .  ,1
this is a really fun  breezy  light hearted romantic comedy . you cannot go wrong with meg ryan  s cute perkiness combined with albert einstein  s genius . normally  i  m not a fan of completely fabricated fictional tales about actual people  now deceased and not able to defend themselves  but i think the late einstein might himself have gotten a chuckle out of this one .  br    br   it  s the      s . . . princeton  new jersey in the spring . the story revolves around a pretty  young  scatter brained mathematician  catherine  meg ryan   who is all set to marry a stuffy jerk  a behavioral researcher named james  merely because he has the brains she  s looking for in the father of her future children . however  it  s love at first sight when her car breaks and she meets an auto mechanic named ed  tim robbins  . as she doesn  t think ed is intelligent enough  her uncle  none other than albert einstein  plays match maker  assisted in his endeavors by three mischievous cronies  all theoretical physicists . uncle albert must make ed appear suitably smart  so concocts a charade portraying him as a physicist . . . naturally with amusing results .  br    br   walter matthau is his usual hilarious self  and pulls off the character of einstein quite effectively . with his three professorial buddies  kurt  nathan  and boris  a lot of laughs ensue . the real einstein had a genuine human side and this film just takes it one  outrageous  step further . if you suspend all logic  you can almost imagine this silly story happening   br    br   it might not be rocket science  despite its main character  but it is a wonderful sweet  refreshing movie . one of the best of the comedy romance genre .  ,1
i am afraid it was a movie that you have to actually watch to get anything out of it . i t is not a mindless movie like . . . . .  leathal weapon part    you know the one where riggs is really crazy  it is not a movie that is pretty much the same at the end as it is a the beginning . you can run everywhere talk on the phone do what ever and enjoy it in any way . i have noticed in the past that most people that do not like this type of movie are the type that will do most anything but watch a movie and then slam it because . . . . . duh they don  t get it or understand it or what happened .  br    br   don  t let your doggy take a shower     ,1
i don  t think anyone sitting down to view this film would be expecting anything remotely appearing like a classic ghost story but you have to ask yourself when it  s over if you were ever scared . this doesn  t really work on that level but the cast does try hard and the film doesn  t tack on one of those happy endings . story is about an american couple who travel to kyoto  japan so that ted fletcher  edward albert  can write a book and he brings along his wife laura  susan george  and their daughter amy  amy barrett  . their friend alex curtis  doug mcclure  who works at the american consulate helps them find a house to live in and he finds one that is haunted . about    years earlier in the same house a samurai found his wife cheating on him and he kills both of them and then commits suicide . their ghosts still inhabit the house and when the fletcher  s arrive it doesn  t take long before strange things start happening .  br    br   spoiler alert  br    br   at times the ghosts inhabit the bodies of the fletcher  s and they start to act like the japanese people that they were before and laura starts to flirt with alex which leads to an affair . meanwhile  ted starts behaving more strict and after he pours soup down the throat of amy he goes to ask a monk for help . unfortunately the ghosts get ted  laura  and alex to play out their death scene like it happened    years earlier .  br    br   this film was directed by kevin connor who is known as a good television director but he has made horror and science fiction films before and has worked with mcclure on some of them . while this never comes close to being scary or developing atmosphere it does have two things in it that i liked . first  it doesn  t have one of those sappy endings where the couple embrace after defeating the demons . instead  it ends in a very bloody fight where everyone succumbs to the evil of the ghosts . secondly  it has susan george in the cast  i  ve always been a fan of hers even though she has appeared in mostly schlock but her performances are always top notch . also she usually appears nude which she does here in two separate scenes and while she doesn  t have classic features she does have a unique tomboy like look about her and it  s one of the reasons why she was so popular . but after appearing in silly films such as this i think it led to her getting out of the business or working only sporadically . this isn  t a bad film but it  s never convincing and watching the ghosts scurry around when the monk gives an exorcism is practically worthy of a giggle or two . the bottom line is that this is silly and i hope george decides to resume her career .  ,0

louis creed  a doctor from chicago  moves to a large house near a small town  since he is going to be giving classes in the university of maine  s . along with him  is his wife rachel and their two kids  ellie and gage  as well as ellie  s cat  church . soon  they met their new neighbor  and old man named judd crandall . judd not only warns louis and rachel about the danger that is the highway that runs past their house  that is constantly a way used by big trucks  but also show to the family a pet cemetery that is located near their house . judd starts to talk about the importance of the pet cemetery  but rachel is against to talk about death and spirituality with her children  since she has traumas from her sister zelda  s death .  br    br   during the first week of the family in the new house  louis already has dead people to deal with victor pascow  a student who has been fatally injured in an automobile accident  addresses his dying words to louis personally  even though the two men are strangers . on the night following pascow  s death  louis experiences what he believes is a very vivid dream in which he meets pascow  who leads him to the pet cemetery and warns louis to not  go beyond  no matter how much you feel you need to .  louis wakes up in bed the next morning convinced it was only a dream  until he discovers his feet and the bedsheets covered with dirt and pine needles . anyway  he dismisses the dream . many strange things starts to happen and church  ellie  s cat  dies while walking on the highway . louis stays worried in how he is going to talk about church  s death with ellie  but judd  sympathizing with him  jud takes louis to the pet cemetery  supposedly to bury church . but instead of stopping there  jud leads louis farther on a frightening journey to  the real cemetery   an ancient burial ground that was once used by the micmac   . . . indians . . .   . there louis buries the cat on jud  s instruction  with jud saying that animals buried there have come back to life . and that is where the real horror story begins . . .  br    br   i personally find this movie very good . it  s not the most horrifying of all  but it is one of the best horror movies i watched . the way gage dies  is almost impossible to not stay in your memory  specially being a toddler . it  s cool to see stephen king  s cameo as the minister of the funeral .  br    br   of course  there are some script errors how can a rich doctor with two small kids  goes to live in a place where there is a dangerous highway near his house  how gage has no scratches or anything after being hit by a truck  why louis continues to resurrect every member of his family knowing they are all going to stay like monsters  things like that doesn  t make any sense  but i can understand that all horror  s scripts needs to have some surreal ideas to work .  br    br   a good thing i saw in this movie  is the necessity to talk about death with the children  no matter what is your religion or if you are an atheist  and also that avoiding important subjects doesn  t help anything . because of louis being afraid to be honest with ellie  confronting her and saying that her cat wouldn  t be back again  all the nightmare began .  ,1
i agree totally with another of the reviewers here who was pleased  for the birds  won the oscar in     for  best animated short   not this sick material  which is pretentious at best and appealing to anyone  of course  who has no belief in heaven or hell .  br    br   the animation was good  but so are a lot of animated shorts . and  by the way  i love dark humor but this just was unappealing from the start .  br    br   as for the story here a guy walking around and surrounded by nothing but grey  symbolism here  is told by a tv set  which appears every few hundred yards away  that he is in either heaven  hell  or purgatory . each time he puts a gun to his head and shoots himself after hearing the news . i guess that would be funny in two of the three instances .  ,0
this     version of the dickens  classic a christmas carol   directed by clive donner  stars george c . scott as ebenezer scrooge . by this time around  the challenge for the filmmaker was to take such familiar material and make it seem fresh and new again and  happily to say  with this film donner not only met the challenge but surpassed any expectations anyone might have had for it . he tells the story with precision and an eye to detail  and extracts performances from his actors that are nothing less than superlative  especially scott . one could argue that the definitive portrayal of scrooge   one of the best known characters in literary fiction  ever   was created by alastair sim in the     film but i think with his performance here  scott has now achieved that distinction . there is such a purity and honesty in his scrooge that it becomes difficult to even consider anyone else in the role once you  ve seen scott do it simply put  he is scrooge . and what a tribute it is to such a gifted actor to be able to take such a well known figure and make it so uniquely his own is quite miraculous . it is truly a joy to see an actor ply his trade so well  to be able to make a character so real  from every word he utters down to the finest expression of his face  and to make it all ring so true . it  s a study in perfection .  br    br   the other members of the cast are splendid as well  but then again they have to be in order to maintain the integrity of scott  s performance and they do . frank finlay is the ghost of jacob marley a notable turn  though not as memorable  perhaps  as the one by alec guinness  as marley  in the film  scrooge .  angela pleasence is a welcome visage as the spirit of christmas past edward woodward  grand and boisterous  and altogether convincing as the spirit of christmas present and michael carter  grim and menacing as the spirit of christmas yet to come .  br    br   david warner hits just the right mark with his bob cratchit  bringing a sincerity to the role that measures up well to the standard of quality set by scott  s scrooge  and susannah york fares just as well as mrs . cratchit . the real gem to be found here  though  is the performance of young anthony walters as tiny tim it  s heartfelt without ever becoming maudlin  and simply one of the best interpretations   and the most real   ever presented on film .  br    br   the excellent supporting cast includes roger rees  fred holywell  and also the narrator of the film   caroline langrishe  janet holywell   lucy gutteridge  belle   michael gough  mr . poole  and joanne whalley  fan  . a flawless presentation  this version of a christmas carol  sets the standard against which all others must be gauged no matter how many versions you may have seen  watching this one is like seeing it for the first time ever . and forever after  whenever you think of scrooge  the image your mind will conjure up will be that of george c . scott . a thoroughly entertaining and satisfying experience  this film demands a place in the annual schedule of the holiday festivities of every home . i rate this one      .  ,1
john waters has given us a genuinely enjoyable film . this certainly isn  t without its shocking waters  esque moments  but it is tamer than his older culty stuff  such as  pink flamingoes  .  pecker  harkens back to john  s early mainstream stage in that it reminds the viewer of the same kind of humor that was evident in  polyester  . overall  a really fun comedy with some great moments   ,1
     was the most prolific year for astaire and rogers . their second film for rko that year is the third film in this collection  mark sandrich  s  follow the fleet .  this time out astaire is painfully uncomfortable as bake baker  a seaman on leave who just happens to stumble into the seedy waterfront caf where sherry martin  rogers  is warbling romantic sweet nothings in everyone  s ear . yep  you guessed it  they  re hot for each other once again . only this time sherry  s spinster sister  connie  harriet hillard  threatens the whole fine romance by falling for bake  s robust seafaring buddy  bilge smith  randolph scott   a sort of use  em up and toss  em out kind of guy  thus forcing sherry to reconsider her opinion of all sailors in general . irving berlin lends immeasurable class to the proceedings with his classic  classy score  including standards  let yourself go    i  m putting all my eggs in one basket  and  let  s face the music and dance  the latter a divinely inspired skit about suicide that turns into another immediately recognizable and thoroughly sublime pas deux for fred and ginger .  br    br   the transfer on  follow the fleet  is a tad weaker . the gray scale remains nicely balanced but now it  s a tad thick looking with not nearly as much tonal variation as the previous titles . grain is still present . so are age related artifacts . once you  ve settled into to the slightly dense and sometimes more softly focused image quality  the overall impression is more than acceptable for a film of this vintage . the audio is mono but very nicely balanced . extras include a featurette  theatrical trailer and short subject  but oddly  no audio commentary . considering the importance of this film in the overall canon of astaire  rogers this is an uncharacteristic oversight from warner home video .  ,1
i love science fiction  i am fascinated by egyptian mythology and i appreciate digital animation . i figured a movie that combines these three would be at least enjoyable . i could not have been more wrong the story  or actually the lack there of  was completely uninspired and lacks imagination  while imagination usually is the biggest component of any science fiction story . the dialogue and acting are even worse than in an average porno movie . especially thomas kretschmann gives new meaning to the term  bad performance  . bad acting wouldn  t have been such a huge problem if only  director  bilal didn  t take himself so seriously all the lines sound like they are supposed to be poetic  it looks like bilal really thinks he has made a piece of art here . well  there  s no art or poetry to be found in this piece of junk  only pretentiousness  this man should really stick to making comics  since he fails on all possible accounts as a director . worst of all is the terrible digital animation  which is so ugly that it actually turns watching this movie into a physically painful experience . the graphics look so fake they even make the werewolves in  van helsing  look like live actors  and since half the characters are cgi  animated  it is quite a problem that the cgi  effects look so fake . if the egyptian gods actually exist then bilal  s a dead guy  since they will no doubt take gruesome revenge on him for the ridiculous way in which he portrays them in this disastrously bad movie .  ,0
i picked up this movie with the intention of getting a bad zombie movie . but i had no idea what i was getting myself into .  br    br   i started the movie and soon i had been pulled into a world of pain and visual torture .  br    br   i finally know what hell is like . it  s this movie . for eternity . this movie has no value . it didn  t even really have a plot . there was stuff going on in each scene but no overall explanation why anything happens .  br    br   instead of watching this movie i suggest that you line the nearest blender with oil and try and stuff as many bullets in it as you can . you will find that the outcome to be far more pleasant than this movie .  br    br   don  t even watch it . not even to see how bad it is . i beg you . if you watch it  then it means they win .  ,0
daraar got off to a pretty good start . the first scene really left me at the edge of my seat wondering what would happen next . other than that  the first half of the movie is a total bore . all the first half of the movie is about is rishi kapoor falling head over heels in love with juhi chawla . by the way  don  t you think he  s a little old for her     br    br   things finally start to spice up towards the middle of the film when juhi tells us about her previous husband and wow what a lunatic is he  he was an over  protective  neat  freak with a really hot temper  he used to beat up poor juhi for no good reason  one of the reasons i really don  t like this movie is because i can  t stand to see juhi  my favorite actress  get so abused . this film in general has way too much abuse and bloodshed i find it so sickening     br    br   anyway  all i  m trying to say is if you  re thinking about renting daraar  you should put it right back on the shelf where you found it and pick something else   ,0
i know  i know it  s childish . but i just love this type of movie . a bird that suffered a lot of  mishaps  and still hasn  t lost his faith in humanity and his sense of humor . what  s special about this film is the fact that the main character is paulie  the parrot  and he  s not used as a boost to some hotshot human actor . furthermore i like the storyline paulie tells his lifestory to a cleaner at the point he hit rock bottom .  by the way jay mohr  s voice almost sounds like joe pesci  s   . and cheech marin of course  the man is humor to me . ever since i saw  up in smoke  i have appreciated his naive way of performing  making a simple situation a hilarious one . . can  t help myself .  ,1
an absolutely brilliant show . the second season began where the first ended  with much mystery . suspense in most  if not all episodes and mystery everywhere . one that made me think and think again . it  s truly amazing how the writer can come out with all the connections and link all the characters together and combine all these elements to make the lives of the characters in the show so meaningful . never fail to excites and i am looking forward to the new season . hopefully more secrets will be reveal and at the same time  more mystery to be solved . good selection of cast too for this show  fit the characters perfectly . really can  t wait to finally discover the secret . hopefully all the hype won  t spoil the ending .  ,1
three girls  an all  female media  crew  including cult  actress barbara bach  no less  visiting a small town to cover a festival  end up renting rooms in a house they should have avoided like the plague . well  made little shocker  suffering a bit from some redundant dialogue  scenes and a rather thin plot  line  that doesn  t do very well in hiding its secrets  . one underlying theme in particular is quite disturbing  as in vintage shock  material   and this is basically what the film thrives on . performances  cinematography are pretty much above par  compared to many other late    s  early    s films in the same vein   but what really makes me recommend this film is the fairly long climax  scene in the basement  setting . from the moment that  keller junior  character was introduced  his performance made my jaw drop open and it didn  t close until the end of the film . a very pleasant surprise to see actor sydney lassick  who was funnily wacko in  one flew over the cuckoo  s nest   and now utterly demented in  the unseen   take on one of the leading roles .  ,1
i went into this with my hopes up  by twenty minutes into the movie i couldn  t have been more let down . despite thinking that this would be another horribly bad remake  i kept my hopes high that maybe . . . just maybe someone would get it right this time around . sadly  prom night is about on the same quality level as the recent april fools day remake  bad script  bad direction  cheesy overdone acting and generally bad horror .  br    br   from beginning to end it  s boring  repetitive and worthy of about a dozen eye rolls . we  ve seen it all before and we  ve seen it done a million times better then this . if you go to see prom night in the theater  i  d say wait for the dvd or ppv   get ready for the audience to laugh  because laugh they will . the laughs aren  t at points in the movie that are supposed to be funny  they are in response to key  thrilling  moments in the film that are so poorly done you feel as if your watching the newest installment of scary movie . seriously  was this supposed to be a remake or a spoof  the film makers missed the mark so badly here  that a large number of the audience in the theater i attended walked out about halfway through the movie . which in retrospect  i wish i had done . not me though  i had to torture myself and stick with it hoping it would get better . needless to say it didn  t . the  horror  scenes are a joke  not even so much because of the acting but because of the direction  the script  the  special effects  and the camera work . the movie manages to look as if they spent a fortune to produce it  but still came out of it with a micro budget movie . i halfway expected to see dollar store tags on some of the props and kept thinking i would spot a porn star in the cast somewhere .  br    br   this movies scary alright  if this is the future of big budget horror then the horror genre is doomed .  ,0
a neat  race against time  premise  a murdered john doe is found to have pneumonic plague  so while the health authority and nopd battle everybody and each other trying to find his waterfront contacts  the murderers think the heat is because the victim  s infected cousin is holding out on them .  br    br   this movie is freely available from the internet archive and it  s well worth downloading . a lot  all   of this movie was filmed in genuine new orleans locations  which makes it interesting to look at for what is now period detail  though to me it does look under  exposed  even for noir  maybe mobile lighting rigs then weren  t what they are . there is also a plenty of location background noise  which is slightly distracting  car horns in the love scene  anyone  there are a lot of non  professional supporting artists in crowd scenes  and this may explain why the pacing of the film is slightly saggy to begin with  not much chance for retakes or recasting  though the final chase is worth hanging on for . there  s not much wrong with the lead actors either jack palance is genuinely scary as a charismatic  intelligent psychopath  the later scene as he alternately comforts and threatens the sick cousin is terrific  while widmark  as he often did  pitches the righteous anger of the man on a mission at a believable level  most of the time .  br    br   somebody should remake this  no supernaturals  no mysticism  no special fx  just a good yarn full of character conflict  and a topical theme . another reviewer mentioned the writer john kennedy o  toole  and that  s spot on with the number of oddball new orleans types peppering this dark  sleazy  against  the  clock drama . there  s even a midget newspaper seller .  br    br    community  what community  d  you think you  re living in the middle ages    ,1
admittedly  i didn  t have high expectations of  corky romano .  but then again  who did  however  i felt it deserved the benefit of the doubt . i had no high hopes of  joe dirt  either   another recent comedy starring an snl cast member   and i ended up being pleasantly surprised . but this film is just as bad as it looks in the previews . chris kattan is actually a talented comic actor   contrary to what you might think after watching this movie   with great energy . he  s been in many hilarious snl skits  and i think he  s one of the most talented cast members on snl as of now . in this case  he  s given a lame  pointless script and he tries to remedy each scene with his incessant mugging . throughout each scene  he attempts a lame jerry lewis act and fails miserably . jerry lewis knew how to pull off this type of physical comedy  not to mention he worked with much better writing . kattan simply looks like some ignorant fool with adhd who had one too many cafe lattes . he doesn  t even wait for the punchline he assumes we  ll all laugh once he starts jumping around like an ape on crack . in one scene  he ends up in a tugging match with a dog who has a package of cocaine in his mouth . the package explodes and the cocaine splashes all over him . he comes back to the job  strung out on coke . now  how are we supposed to laugh at the fact that he  s acting hyper and on  edge  when he  s doing the same thing throughout the whole film   br    br   as for the rest of the cast members . . . vanessa shaw is really hot  peter berg is wasted in a thankless role and so is chris penn . peter falk is also wasted  though he has a few funny lines that i  m pretty sure he improvised . i hope falk gets a decent movie someday soon . that  s too much talent too waste on a clunker like  corky romano .  i didn  t like falk  s last movie  made  all that much either  but at least he had a decent role .  br    br   i chuckled a few times  but i could not get a single laugh . each gag is performed with no sense of timing or delivery . and it  s made worse by kattan  s hammy acting . and there are certain gags that are streneously dragged out . for example  when kattan is about to fart in his two brothers  faces . he stands there for  or  minutes  trying to get out a fart and when he finally he does it  s a little tiny one . it  s bad enough when you have a gag that  s funny and drag it out  but when you have a lame gag and you drag it out it  s a hell of a lot worse . and another example of this is when he tries to translate what those two asian men are saying during a drug bust . i can go on and on about what  s wrong with this so  called comedy  but i  m not gonna waste my time . like i said earlier  if you predicted bad things from the trailers   you predicted right .  br    br   my score   out of     ,0
unlike other commenters who have commented on this movie  s ability to transcend race  contrarily  i think that this powerful film provides a complex and deep story that addresses institutional racism and the effects thereof . washington directs fisher  s story with a careful hand and critical eye  relinquishing this cinematic endeavor neither to dismemberment of women  s bodies  perpetuating unthoughtful stereotypes  nor satisfying the expectation of the white gaze . i think this film might be a bit too happy in the end however  it is deeply entrenched in afro  american culture and discourse to the point that some white spectators may get the feeling of looking into the life of this afro  american   antwone fisher . i have problems with the naval aspect of the film  but when we look at america  there are not many choices or opportunities for black men who are  were in fisher  s situation or similar situations . viewers may go to this movie expecting a  black movie what is a  black movie    br    br   do stereotypes of pimps  whores  drug dealers  single parent homes  and so forth constitute a  black movie   i think washington as director recognized that afro  americans and other people of color deal with human problems like abuse and displaced aggression to name a few . these problems have   historically and presently   only been given light and validity via  good will hunting  and other white movies it  s high time they were given the same recognition and validity as their white counterparts in and out of the media .  br    br   sad to say though  in this racist country  denzel washington and derek luke will probably have to wait another ten years before they receive an oscar or anything else . they both will have to wait until they direct or star in a movie that perpetuates the usual racist and sexist stereotypes to get an oscar . that is to say  denzel deserved awards for  malcolm x    hurricane  and others before that jive  training day  oscar . that is not to negate or push aside other great actresses and actors of color who are denied their due praise for ingenious work . yet hollywood would rather send the message that racism and sexism and heterosexism are acceptable by perpetuating and even rewarding those stereotypes as they appear in countless films such as  american beauty    midnight in the garden of good and evil    american pie   and even  gone with the wind .   br    br   derek luke is a helluva actor and i wish him best . all of the other actresses and actors gave superb performances hands down  although i do take issue with denzel  s selection of yet another straight  haired  light  skinned sistuh . that said  everyone should watch this film . however  it may not be for everyone . much luv .       ,1
it  s so rare to find a literary work adequately translated to the screen that i may have rated this film higher than it deserves  but not by much . as a long  time student of vonnegut  s works  i have no hesitation in recommending the film to his readers  at least to those that love him as i do . the casting is inspired nolte is understated in triumph  bewildered in defeat  decisive in judgment . sheryl lee is luscious throughout  but her handling of the treacherous resi and her tragic crescendo almost makes you forget her beauty . alan arkin delivers a totally lovable  but equally treacherous  soviet spy .  br    br   do not feel you have to read mother night to appreciate the film though  if you haven  t read mother night  you will probably want to after viewing the film .  br    br   notice the shifts from color to black  and  white and back again  and don  t miss the final symbolism of campbell  s noose . watch  also  for kurt vonnegut  s cameo near the end of the film .  br    br   bing crosby  s  white christmas  will never sound the same  i write in mid  december  when the song is getting heavy radio play  and it  s driving me nuts  .  ,1
in the area of movies based off of screenplays from some other area  or whatever the title for that oscar is    holes  has credibility . i think it is better to have the author create the screenplay because the author is the creator of the material . if the author can  t write a screenplay to save their life  then have the author and someone fluently talented in the area of screenwriting create it . aside from that  this review is about  holes  .  br    br   the reasons start here and a spoiler maybe found within .    louis sachar is an excellent author and it turns that he can write a screenplay . i watched the movie and then read the book and both didn  t reek incoherence or stupidity . some people just have natural talents that can transcend mediums .    the best performance award goes to shia labeouf for his portrayal as the main character . he  dug  himself into the role . i wanted to see his character vindicated before the conclusion .    to ratchet up the suspense a bit  andrew davis was brought in . this is the man that made harrison ford run hard and run fast . he also can make steven seagal smash some heads . as for this film  he made shia and the rest of the boys dig some holes . in other words  he can make an  action  packed  movie and make it well even if  action  isn  t the main genre isn  t  action  .    my second favorite performance goes to jon voight as mr . sir . sometimes a goofy role brings out the best in a performer . when voight uttered the line  once upon a time . . .   i must have laughed for half a minute because it was so funny . he is capable of comedy and he should investigate a few more roles that let him to exercise that talent .    tim blake nelson is very solid whenever he is given a solid script . this is probably the second best role i have seen him in  second only to  o brother where art thou    .    i love the choice of settings for the movie . i didn  t know california was that dry or that barren . i guess population and land area figures both can be misleading .    the overall look of the movie made me want another bottle of water . one could only imagine digging a hole in that barren area for half a day .    the rest of the cast should deserve a box of kudos bars as well . sigourney weaver  henry winkler  khleo thomas  jake m . smith and the rest of the bill were tapped because of their talents and it gelled very well . great cast even though it was anywhere near ensemble .    i like a movie that doesn  t explain anything right away . when stanley got clocked in the head with those baseball cleats  it made me want to see how weird the events could get and that is a key ingredient in making a good movie .     disney pictures  not touchstone  disney    needs to make a few more of these mature juvenile films . it was palatable for me and i am a college student . the last mature juvenile disney film i saw was  something wicked this way comes  and  holes  possibly exceeds it  like the election in      it  s still to close to call  . disney can make greatness if they decide to expand on this genre and keeps artistry in mind over milking a cash cow when they see it . ten reasons give a score of ten   br    br   all in all   holes  is one of my favorite disney films and probably one of the best this year  granted this movie may not be oscar material but whoever said oscar material is the best material   . in terms of being a movie from a book i have read  this ranks behind  fight club  on my list  which is on top  . for being a film i saw in      this is in the top five  somewhere behind  mystic river   . compared against  harry potter   stanley yelnats easily takes a shovel to harry  s head and brings the final death blow with a smelly sneaker to potter  s nose . everybody should see this movie because it both informs and entertains . here ends my rant   ,1
the guy did a lot of title design for a bunch of movies and i guess one day he said i should pick a cheap scenario  try to put as much title in it as a can  cause after all i  m a title designer  and try to persuade people that this is in fact a movie . one of the worst i  ve even seen that  s for sure . if you fell the urge to see nice titles  go check out some posters don  t waste your time watching this .  br    br   it kinda ironic don  t you think  did you saw the poster  the only part of his project that should had title work done have almost none   ,0
there isn  t one decent scene .  br    br   amy adams gives one of the worst performances of all time . proof that you a can start anywhere . the guy playing sebastian sucks  too . he doesn  t even look much like ryan phillipe . more like joshua jackson . the two other girls are terrible  as well .  br    br   then the dialogue is also crap .  br    br   sebastian  about to have threesome   if you cant beat them . . .  br    br   virgin girl who says you can  t beat  em   br    br   lame .  br    br   the ending contradicts the entire plot of the original . in the first film  it is clearly stated that kathryn and sebastian never had sex . one of the reasons sebastian wanted kathryn so bad  aside from the fact that she  s played by sarah michelle gellar  was that she was  the only girl he couldn  t have and it killed him  . she was a tease who liked playing with him . the fact that she never gave it to him increased his wanting . then in this p . o . s .  it implies that he can have her  along with a girl on the side . what  and we don  t even see the sex  either . it  s implied  making it not only stupid  pointless  and contradictory  but worthless too .  br    br   and in the first one  kathryn rejects sebastian because he fell in love  making him a loser . even though he won the bet  that crumbled his chances . then in this excrement  he looses and falls in love . so she doesn  t screw  losers   only complete losers  another thing it  s stated that sebastian has never been in love  so what do you call the thing with virgin girl   br    br   then at the end  virgin girl is all of sudden revealed to be kathryn  s evil lesbian lover  dun dun dun  and  like i said  they go into a lame offscreen threesome . stupid .  br    br   there  s several other plot contradictions . did the writer even see the first film  a  year old can point his stuff out .  br    br   after the threesome  sebastian has sex with the blonde virgin  corrupting her innocent mind in the back of a limo while kathryn and virgin girl turned evil lesbian in lame sudden plot twist sit in the front  listen  and smile evilly into the camera .  br    br   the end . . .  br    br   seeing sebastian become the ass hole he was in the first one could have made an interesting film . i guess all it took to make little sebastian bad was a threesome with two hot girls . interesting .  ,0
i just thought it was excellent and i still do . i  m grateful we  re still able to see different stuff from what hollywood almost floods us with . saving grace is smart and enjoyable  those who feel offended by the marijuana thing better go see the america  s bride sort of movie .  br    br   saving grace also shows that a funny movie doesn  t have to be stupid . i was laughing my ass off during most of it but also pondering questions about what was the female lead character supposed to do to pay her deceased husband  s debts .  br    br   in a nutshell  a witty storyline with typical english humour and good acting and directing . you couldn  t ask for more .  br    br       .  ,1
the comparison is perhaps unfair  but inevitable . those attracted to the intimacy and depth of umbrellas will be slightly horrified to discover a cut  and  paste musical in the american style  awkward  stilted dialogue with inexplicable song  and  dance numbers . gene kelly  s french accent was apparently so poor  that a dreadful job of dubbing was substituted  as you  ll remember  the dubbing was almost perfectly pulled off in umbrellas  . the translation of the french  for subtitled versions   as well  leaves something to be desired  although this can  t be attributed to demy . the film also has several self  aware moments that come off a wee disconcerting  such as references in songs to legrand himself . and the costumes  well  the tight pants  white boots combination  and the freakishly unnatural colors  reminds one of an austin powers film . . .  br    br   but demy does reward the viewer with allusions to umbrellas note  for instance  the suitcase carried by maxence in his departure from rochefort  this is the same suitcase carried by guy in his departure from cherbourg . also  note the  convenient brunette of resolution   madeleine in umbrellas  and josette in young girls .  br    br   generally speaking  those expecting the natural feel of umbrellas  save the floating bicycle scene   or looking for similar deeper questions and ambiguous endings as in umbrella  s script  should probably pass this one b y . those looking for a french version of a thin    s american musical will be quite happy .  ,0
i really enjoyed this   i  m a big fan of movies that mess with your mind and leave you with a lot of questions and ideas to debate  and this was a stellar example . but then  terry gilliam is always good at that  well  almost always . let  s just forget about jabberwocky and the brothers grimm  shall we   .  br    br   i particularly liked the way it handled the time travel theme and the avoidance of paradoxes   the way events in the past and future intertwined and fed into each other .  br    br   it was also really well done aesthetically   the art direction was really great  and i wish i  d been able to see it on the big screen . the future scenes had a similar feel to brazil in a lot of ways  and even the present scenes were often really visually compelling .  br    br   but perhaps the most striking thing about it was that it featured two actors i normally don  t much like  bruce willis and brad pitt  and they both delivered amazing performances here . pitt especially   i  d seen one or two films before that made me realize he could in fact actually act  contrary to what i  d originally thought   but this one really outdid them . i actually found myself asking my friends at one point  are you sure that  s brad pitt   this is probably the most memorable performance of his career  though admittedly that may not be saying too much  .  ,1
pakeezah is in my mind the greatest achievement of indian cinema . the film is visually overwhelming but also emotionally breathtaking . the music  the songs  the sets  the costumes  the cinematography  in fact every creative element is worthy of superlatives .  ,1
this film is so old i never realized how young looking ray milland looked in      i remember him playing in a great film   lost weekend  . ray plays the role of michael stuart  who is a very rich banker . there are three girls in this picture who are not very happy about their father and mother separating and they find out their father is going to get married to a young blonde who is a gold digger only looking for a rich sugar daddy . they hire a man to pose as a very rich count  his name is count ariszted   misha auer  who is drunk all the time and is penniless and gives plenty of comic laughs throughout the picture . deanna durbin   penny craig  surprised everyone when she was booked in a police station and told the chief of police that she was an opera star and then penny starts singing with the most fantastic soprano voice i have every heard  the entire police department and convicts started applauding  which was a very entertaining and enjoyable scene from this film . this is deanna durbin  s first film debut and she became an instant success over night and went on to become a great movie star with universal studios after leaving mgm .  ,1
a prison cell . four prisoners  carrere  a young company director accused of fraud    year old transsexual in the process of his transformation  daisy  a   year  old mentally challenged idiot savant and lassalle  a   year  old intellectual who murdered his wife . behind a stone slab in the cell  mysteriously pulled loose  they discovered a bookthe diary of a former prisoner  danvers  who occupied the cell at the beginning of the century . the diary contains magic formulas that supposedly enable prisoners to escape .  malefique  is one of the creepiest and most intelligent horror films i have seen this year . the film has a grimy  shadowy feel influenced by the works of h . p . lovecraft  which makes for a very creepy and unsettling atmosphere . there is a fair amount of gore involved with some imaginative and brutal death scenes and the characters of four prisoners are surprisingly well  developed . it  s a shame that eric valette made truly horrible remake of  one missed call  after his stunning debut .  out of   .  ,1
this is one of the worst film adaptations of a musical ever made . the stage version of a chorus line is wonderful . this movie misses the mark in almost every way . even the casting is baffling . take audrey landers as val .  dance   looks   is val  s song . val  s story is that she is a great dancer but a  in the looks department . yes  she finds a solution  but ultimately she  s a great dancer . what do the brilliant filmmakers do  they hire an actress who can  t dance and is famous for looking great . way to miss the boat .  br    br   then there  s the choreography . i  m sure michael bennett was turning over in his grave . why didn  t they use his choreography  it really can  t be improved upon .  ,0
name just says it all . i watched this movie with my dad when it came out and having served in korea he had great admiration for the man . the disappointing thing about this film is that it only concentrate on a short period of the man  s life  interestingly enough the man  s entire life would have made such an epic bio  pic that it is staggering to imagine the cost for production .  br    br   some posters elude to the flawed characteristics about the man  which are cheap shots . the theme of the movie  duty  honor  country  are not just mere words blathered from the lips of a high  brassed officer  it is the deep declaration of one man  s total devotion to his country .  br    br   ironically peck being the liberal that he was garnered a better understanding of the man . he does a great job showing the fearless general tempered with the humane side of the man .  ,1
every time this film is on the bbc somebody in the radio times says how it is a satire against the post war world of rationing and the welfare state . i do not think this is the point of the film at all . the film parodies the spivs  small time criminals who ran the blackmarket  and the housewives league who campaigned against government restrictions but were really a tory front organisation .  br    br   yes of course the film sends up the political  social situation but in the end the people realise that they need all the controls to ensure a fair society  they want to be british and muddle through rather than foreign .  br    br   but i don  t think they go back to being exactly like they were before .  ,1
in this sequel to the     action  comedy classic k    detective dooley james belushi and his dog jerry lee return to fight crime  but this time they are teamed up with another detective christine tucci and her partner  a mean doberman named zues who does not get along with jerry lee very well . dooley does not get along with his new partner much either . that all changes as the movie goes along . the movie is intense as their is a guy that really wants to kill dooley for the way he treated him in the past . there is some dramatic scenes dealing with the death of dooley  s wife that don  t really seem to be with the tone of the movie because the rest of the movie is action sequences  dog poop jokes  fart jokes  and jokes about dogs biting bad guys in a certain area . i know that that seems like very low humor  but some of it is actually very funny . i didn  t see this movie for the jokes  i saw it for two reasons . the first reason is because i am a big james belushi fan and the second is for the action sequences . james belushi is funnier than he was in k   and the action sequences at are better too . it would have been nice to see more characters from k   to return  but it  s still a fun movie . if you are a james belushi fan  you  ll love this movie .  ,1
someone should tell goldie hawn that her career as a teen  age gamin ended thirty years ago .  br    br   this is one of the worst films released in years  an unequivocal disaster in which the two leads give themselves over to a frenetic exposition of their trademark tics in an effort to make up for a bad script and bad directing . this thing should have been smothered at birth .  br    br   i hope john cleese got paid a lot for having his name attached to this disaster . he is the only performer who came through this stinking mess more or less unscathed  his only fault being a failure to realize that the rest of the cast would sink the picture .  ,0
two days after seeing this thing  i  m still in agony over having seen it . it  s so bad  you have to wonder how anyone could write this tripe  much less allow it to be loose on the general public . stilted acting  a leading man who looks like he  s sleepwalking  and alison eastwood embarrassing herself . the action is indicative of low budget movie making  which means it is painfully bad . the plot  well  if you were  years old  then you could have written this movie . simplistic  idealistic  and just plain lame .  ,0

on paper  this movie would sound incredibly boring . the idea of a    year  old man traveling the country  side on a riding mower certainly doesn  t have much appeal to it  but the real power behind the film is its charm and its intelligence . writers will not find a better study of what makes a movie work than  the straight story .   br    br   the perfect example of this is a scene in which alvin meets a runaway teenage girl . she  s pregnant and afraid of what her parents would do if they found out . alvin tells her a story about his own kids  long ago . he had them each take a stick and break it  which they could easily do . then he had them bundle the sticks and try to break them .  that bundle   he said   is family .  so many other movies would feel compelled to continue and make sure we knew that an individual could be broken but together the members were stronger .  the straight story  realizes that we  re smart enough to understand this and simply leaves us to contemplate the thought and draw our own conclusions .  br    br   alvin  s journey across iowa is full of such refreshingly un  hollywood character interactions . each interaction is full of warmth and humor  and alvin is so cute riding his mower that we can  t help but smile as he makes his way to wisconsin to make peace with his brother  lyle  who has suffered a stroke . and the simplicity of the final scene emphasizes that the real story here is not the destination but the journey . it  s a journey in which alvin shares his life with everyone he meets   to their benefit and ours . it  s a slow  simple  relaxing ride meant to remind us of all that we  ve lost with the urbanization of america .  br    br    the straight story  is the rare live  action  g   rated movie that truly should not be missed . grade a  ,1
what was always missing with the matrix story was how things came to be in the real world . say no more  because this part of the story covered most of the bases . what was truly interesting was how political it was  maybe even a cheap shot at the current presidential administration . fascism and violence were the only things man could think of in regards to fighting the robotic horde  who were meant as nothing more than servants to humanity . what i also found interesting was the use of fear and how it was perpetuated by the idea of the unknown . we as humans tend to fall into that trap quite often  letting the lack of logic and thought overtake us because people can  t believe the contrary . well represented and put together  this a true testament to how illogical humans can be .  ,1
spoilers spoilers well  seeing as i am a major hlots fan  maybe i liked the movie more than normal people would . however  this movie is still excellent . it had tons of surprises  and it gave some more closure to the series . while i was sad that bayliss turned into a murderer  the overall feeling i felt was satisfied .  ,1
spencer tracy and katherine hepburn would roll over in their graves if they knew this guess who  s coming to dinner rip off was actually in theaters . along with sidney poitier and katherine houghton these four brilliant actors made a great cultural statement with director stanley kramer  s     master piece . this present day rip off is a joke . so a white guy from an overly stereotyped italian family in rhode island brings his african american girlfriend home  insert gasp here  to his grand father  s funeral . his family members reactions were of course . . . . predictable . this movie was so painfully telegraphed from start to finish my girlfriend actually started fake snoring to signal to me that she wanted to leave . do yourself a favor and rent the original . take a pass on wake .  ,0
this is one of the movies of dev anand who gave great yet distinct movies to hindi movie industries such as jewel thief and guide . the story is short  if you ask me what is the story   plot is simple  a brother seeks for his lost sister . sister has joined the hippies who smoke from pot and chant hare rama hare krishna . yet the movie portrays few of the significant events that the world experienced in    s . hippie culture  their submission to drugs  freedom  escaping duty  family  and adopting anything new such as eastern  which was new for whites  religion . they have been handled perfectly . zeenat gave her best and dev as usual was remarkable . songs are the best used  unlike they are abused for the sake of having songs  in this movie . they have not been spoiled . one perfect example is  dekho o deewano . . . ram ka naam badnam na karo  . each word in the song is very philosophical and meaningful . the end is tragic but that is not the essence of the movie . overall devji who does believe in making different movies has been successful in showing what he wanted to show here . a must see to experience hippie culture and beautiful nepal of    s .  ,1
this one was marred by potentially great matches being cut very short .  br    br   the opening match was a waste of the legion of doom  but i guess the only way they could have been eliminated by demolition was a double  dq . otherwise  mr . perfect would have had to put in overtime . kerry von erich  the i  c champ  was wasted here . and this was the third ppv in a row where perfect jobbed . remember  before that he never lost a match .  br    br   the second match was very good  possibly the best of the night . ted dibiase and the undertaker were excellent  while the jim neidhart had one of his wwf highlights  pinning the honky tonk man . koko b . ware continued his tradition of being the first to put over a new heel  remember the big bossman and yokozuna   . this was a foreshadowing of bret hart  s singles career  as he came back from two  on  one and almost survived the match . he and dibiase put on a wrestling clinic  making us forget that the point of the match was dibiase  s boring feud with dusty rhodes .  br    br   even though the visionaries were the first team to have all of its members survive  and only the second since    to have four survivors   this match was not a squash . this was the longest match of the night  and jake did a repeat of his    performance when he was left alone against four men and dominated . i think he could have actually pulled off an upset . these days  the match would have ended the other way around .  br    br   one of the shortest ss matches ever was also one of its most surprising . possibly the most underrated wrestler ever  tito santana was the inspirational wrestler of the night  putting on war paint and pinning boris zukhov  tanaka  and even the warlord in the final survival match . it was so strange to see him put over so overwhelmingly  then go right back to his mediocre career . sgt . slaughter also did well  getting rid of volkoff and the bushwhackers  but that just wasn  t a surprise . tito was .  br    br   i think the only point of the survival match was to have hogan and the warrior win together at the end .  br    br   this show was boring and the matches were too short . the undertaker  s debut was cool  but tito santana is the reason i will remember this one .  ,0
this movie had lots of great actors and actresses in it and it addressed some very noble issues . it  s full of emotion and the direction is done well . the storyline progresses very quickly  but i guess that  s better than having to watch a  hour movie . this is an easy movie to watch again and again and enjoy .  ,1
alright  i have to admit that i have never seen  rhoda  and only one or two episodes of  the mary tyler moore show .  even though i don  t know anything about this duo of comedic talent  i still liked this movie a lot .  br    br   mary goes back to work . rose tries her luck at being a comedian . rhoda struggles with a photography career . and meredith . . . what exactly does she do again  these three stories that we follow over two hours are amusing and entertaining in their own way . when the two long time friends reunite  it only makes the film better .  br    br   i was surprised about how good the writing was . the little jokes thrown in by mary and rhoda were funny . the script itself was very well put together .  br    br   i had seen moore and harper in other movies over the past few years and thought that they were very good . but i had no idea that they worked this well as a team . while both actresses do their share to fulfill the title of this movie  they never seem to let me down .  during the run of this movie .  joie lenz and marisa ryan play their roles okay but nothing great . the rest of the cast like jonah  cecile and . . . . everybody else also works well together .  br    br   being that this is a reunion  you would expect for a fan of either show to enjoy this . from a non  fan i still enjoyed this little get  together . good story lines for each character and the two main characters is what makes this film very good .  the newer version of the mtm theme song doesn  t hurt either .   ,1
ah  the spirit of    . the streets of paris were running wild with rebellion  the hippies were high on the spirit of love . how was britain marking this age of radicalism and revolution  erm  by the looks of it  dear old blighty was focusing on making films about boys in boarding schools . if . . . contains the evil establishment . it contains the uprising of the oppressed . what it lacks in contrast to the parisien passion and the hippy headtripping is any sense of excitement  except in its all  out ammo  and  artillery fire ending .  br    br   lindsay anderson  s if . . . stars the ever  marvellous malcolm mcdowell as one of three private school pupils who decorate their dorm with photos of lenin and other left  wing radicals . it  s clearly an anti  establishment movie in its depiction of the evil upper  class oiks who rule the roost and the antiquated autocratic practices of the pish  posh public school standard . what makes if . . . unusual though is that for all its radical sympathies  it doesn  t explicitly give us any sense of great tension between human decency and the despotic school system  instead it just kind of floats lacking in plot and lacking in personality .  br    br   surrealist bits fade in and out occasionally and the film slips from black  and  white to colour again  is it due to the low budget or is it an arty expression    but there is little of interest to speak of . all we get is the poignant denouement where the young rebels reach for their rifles and shoot down the shady overlords of the establishment . hooray  a revolution  at last something that demands a second thought unlike the rest of this dull exercise in boarding school daydreaming .  br    br   if . . . could have been a powerful political statement  but as it is it drifts and only gathers any sense of direct interest at the end . instead of being a testament to the dissident zeitgeist of the late  sixties  it only succeeds in being a dazed document of upper  class british education . anarchy  apathy more like  the only man many viewers will want to stick it to after watching if . . . will be lindsay anderson .  ,0
it  s a bit easy . that  s about it .  br    br   the graphics are clean and realistic  except for the fact that some of the fences are  d  but that  s forgiveable . the rest of the graphics are cleaner than goldeneye and many other n   games . the sounds are magnificant . everything from the speaking to the sfx are pleasant and realistic .  br    br   the camera angle is a bit frustrating at times  but it  s the same for every platform game  like banjo  kazooie and donkey kong   .  br    br   i got this game as a christmas present in      and since then  i have dutifully gotten    stars over   times .  ,1
while the story is sweet  and the dancing and singing in the main part of the film are a joy  the uniqueness of the film  and what makes it a masterpiece  is the dream sequence . it features the combination of the highest form of truly american music  gershwin   the engaging beauty of french impressionistic art  kelly  s enthralling choreography  including his rapturous  pas de deux d  amour   really a separate genre   with the most magnificent palette of color ever devised for the set . matching the surging music and the visual explosion with those dances was a true work of a creative genius and a great artist .  ,1
a little girl lives with her father and brother in the middle of the countryside . this little girl rosalie has some psychotic tendencies as the movie opens with her feeding kittens to some kind of creatures in the cemetery  and she has recently lost her mother who went crazy but whilst alive enjoyed staying in the woods all night . the premise of the film has a new young lady coming to rosalie to take care of her . she is introduced to the evil of the woods while driving and  imagine the suspense here  experiences a huge blue barrel falling over the side of a cliff to somehow stop her car dead in its tracks . from there she walks to the nearest house and discovers mrs . whitfield who then goes into a whole lot of explanation about rosalie and her family . the earnestness exuded by the mrs . whitfield character has to be seen to be believed . well  the young lady meets up with the child and we soon learn that not only is she strange but everyone in the film is very bizarre as well . they all do share one thing in common which is none of them ever heard of an acting school . none of these people can act  as evidenced by the few vehicles any of them in the entire film appeared in before or since  and all of them look like they have little idea what is going on  pause to remember lines  and have all the conviction of a paper bag . the director plods through the material in a slow pace with this horrible piano music crescendoing here and there at things that are suppose to be scary . it takes us a bit before we get to a couple of murders by the creature friends  but by that time i didn  t care . the murders are not convincing either  and truth be told the whole film looks like someone through it together on their friend  s farm with the people and things on hand there . that all being said the ending does have some creepy aspects to it though we don  t learn one darn thing about why rosalie is like this or more importantly who the creature with the cheap masks are . cheap doesn  t even begin to describe the budget here with . it basically is a couple old farmhouses and some sheds at the end and of course the woods . someone lent the director a couple old cars too . no special effects of any kind and only the most minimal make  up . there are so many guffaws  ridiculous moments to list  but i will just list a few here that at the very least made me chuckle from the lack of aptitude from the creative powers involved   watch the gardener  s body well after he has been  slain  . len comes in and sees him butchered and you can see his fat belly heave with life .   the dying scene at the end where the actress playing rosalie is killed . she looks like she is listening to directions and takes her sweet time dying considering the method .   how about the guy playing roaslie  s father giving us a cranky poor man  s andy griffith . the scene where he is laughing about boy scouts dying was a weird hoot . the child is indeed a very bad film and is very bad even for the standards of    s cheese if you will . this isn  t a b film but more like a z film with producer harry novak making some money on virtually nothing .  ,0
it is noteworthy that mine is only the third review of this film  whereas patton  lust for glory   producer frank mccarthy  s earlier biography of a controversial american general from the second world war  has to date attracted nearly a hundred comments . like a previous reviewer  i am intrigued by why one film should have received so much more attention than the other .  br    br   one difference between the two films is that patton  is more focused  concentrating on a relatively short period at and immediately after the end of the second world war  whereas macarthur  covers not only this war but also its subject  s role in the korean war  as well as his period as american governor of occupied japan during the interlude .  br    br   the main difference  however  lies in the way the two leaders are played . gregory peck dominates this film even more than george c . scott dominated patton  . whereas scott had another major star  karl malden  playing opposite him as general bradley  none of the other actors in macarthur  are household names  at least for their film work . scott  of course  portrayed patton as aggressive and fiery  tempered  a man who at times was at war with the rest of the human race  not just with the enemy . i suspect that in real life general macarthur was as volcanic an individual as patton  but that is not how he appears in this film . peck  s macarthur is of a more reflective  thoughtful bent  comparable to the liberal intellectuals he played in some of his other films . at times  he even seems to be a man of the political left . much of his speech on the occasion of the japanese surrender in     could have been written by a paid  up member of cnd  and his policies for reforming japanese society during the american occupation have a semi  socialist air to them . in an attempt to show something of macarthur  s gift for inspiring leadership  peck makes him a fine speaker  but his speeches always seem to owe more to the studied tricks of the practised rhetorician than to any fire in the heart . it is as if atticus finch from to kill a mockingbird  had put on a general  s uniform .  br    br   whereas scott attempted a warts and all  portrait of patton  the criticism has been made that macarthur  attempts to gloss over some of its subject  s less attractive qualities . i think that this criticism is a fair one  particularly as far as the korean war is concerned . the film gives the impression that macarthur was a brilliant general who dared stand up to interfering  militarily ignorant politicians who did not know how to fight the war and was sacked for his pains when victory was within his grasp . many historians  of course  feel that truman was forced to sack macarthur because the latter  s conduct was becoming a risk to world peace  and had no choice but to accept a stalemate because stalin would not have allowed his chinese allies to be humiliated . even during the korean scenes  peck  s macarthur comes across as more idealistic than his real  life original probably was we see little of his rashness and naivety about political matters .  truman  s remark he knows as much about politics as a pig knows about sunday  was said about eisenhower  but it could equally well have been applied to macarthur  s approach to international diplomacy  . perhaps the film  s attempt to paint out some of macarthur  s warts reflects the period in which it was made . the late seventies  after the twin traumas of vietnam and watergate  was a difficult time for america  and a public looking for reassurance might have welcomed a reassuringly heroic depiction of a military figure from the previous generation . another criticism i would make of the film is that it falls between two stools . if it was intended to be a full biography of macarthur  something should have been shown of his early life  which is not covered at all .  the first we see of the general is when he is leading the american resistance to the japanese invasion of the philippines  . one theme that runs throughout the film is the influence of general macarthur  s father  himself a military hero . i would have liked to see what sort of man arthur macarthur was  and just why his son considered him to be such a hero and role model . another interesting way of making the film would have been to concentrate on korea and on macarthur  s clash with truman  with equal prominence given to the two men and with actors of similar stature playing them . the way in which the film actually was made seemed to me to be less interesting than either of these alternative approaches .  br    br   it would be wrong  however  to give the impression that i disliked the film altogether . although i may not have agreed with peck  s interpretation of the main role  there is no denying that he played it with his normal professionalism and seriousness . the film as a whole is a good example of a solid  workmanlike biopic  thoughtful and informative . it is a good film  but one that could have been a better one .     .  br    br   on a pedantic note  the map which macarthur is shown using during the korean war shows the dmz  the boundary between the two korean states that did not come into existence until after the war .  the pre  war boundary was the   th parallel  . also  i think that macarthur was referring to the tocsin  of war . war may be toxic  but it is difficult to listen with thirsty ear for a toxin .  ,1
this movie should not classify as cinema . although it is over   years old now  it should never  ever have gotten funding  and is a blight on the australian film industry  which is now producing such brilliant films as  the dish   br    br   the actors cannot act  the music is . . to be blunt  not music  the storyline is completely nonexistent and is a struggle to sit through .  br    br   do not watch this film . it is a complete waste of your time .  ,0
i love watching jerry as much as the rest of the world  but this poor excuse for a soft  core porno flick is needlessly offensive  lacks anything resembling wit  and serves merely as a vehicle of self  promotion for springer . even though it runs a quick   minutes  the film drags hideously  and i should have had the common sense to walk out . simply atrocious .  ,0
the fourth in the  dirty harry  series  this film features one of the most despicable  ugliest  unlikable  profane  disgusting females i have ever seen on film  ray perkins   played by audrie neenan . she is the modern nasty low  life version of the      detour  character   ann savage .   br    br   her foul mouth and gutter attitude turned me off so much i never watched this film again until i acquired a profanity filter which shut her up . . . . and least some of her  then i could enjoy the rest of the movie .  br    br   everywhere  harry callahan   clint eastwood  goes  violence immediately follows . . . . . within minutes  it happens so often it  s almost laughable but it makes for a fast  moving  entertaining film with a satisfying ending as all the scumbag villains are eliminated one  by  one .  br    br   this is a very sophomoric film that appeals to our base instincts . . . . . and connects  sad to say . most of us like to see these dirtballs get it in the end  and who does it better than dirty harry   ,1
i am writing this review having watched it several months ago . . . . the trailer looked promising enough for me to buy this lame excuse for a movie . it is a complete joke . . . . and literally a spit in the face of real classics of the early generation of horror like texas chainsaw massacre       which they even had the gall to compare itself to on the back of the cover art . the producer who played brandon should go flip burgers and serve up greasy hamburgers . . . . hell he might not even be good at that either  the lighting was bad bad bad and a big annoyance through out the film you couldn  t even see the actor  s faces sometimes . i don  t even remember the rest of the cast members which is sad really  bad they never do anything to impress you to make them memorable . that  s all the time i will waste on this review please stay as far away as you can from this pile of junk even if you get it for   cents don  t do it buy s piece of gum at least it would keep you entertained   br    br   if you want good quality low budget fun  far better than this . . . then check out a jeff hayes film . . . . because it takes talent to make it in horror and the kid has it   br    br   i gave this  star just for the cover art . . . . thats the only thing worth liking abut this so called  film   br    br    rick blalock  ,0

the alarmist is so abysmally scripted that you have think to yourself why on earth did an up and coming actor like david arquette agree to be in it . it has to be one of the weakest plots i have ever seen and without any humour at all  it borders on the brink of tedious . it staggers along to a dreadful conclusion which appears to only happen because the director got bored and just wanted to wrap up quickly in order to get home for his dinner . stay away  .  ,0
terrfic film with a slightyly slow start  give it a chance to start cooking . story builds in interest and complexity . characters and storyline subvert expectation and cliche at all the right moments . superb new york city locations  gritty  real  are a fantastic antidote to the commercial imperatives of  sex in the city   in fact  the entire film is an antidote to the hbo  hollywood notion of new york city  sex and relationships . it  s a rare film that treats its characters so honestly and compassionately . loved it  great cast with notable performances by steve buscemi  rosario dawson  and her love interest  forgot his name   .  ,1
kurt russell  s chameleon  like performance  coupled with john carpenter  s flawless filmmaking  makes this one  without a doubt  one of the finest boob  tube bios ever aired . it holds up  too the emotional foundation is strong enough that it  ll never age carpenter has preserved for posterity the power and ultimate poignancy of the life of the one and only king of rock and roll .  i  d been a borderline elvis fan most of my life  but it wasn  t until i saw this mind  blowingly moving movie that i looked beyond the image at the man himself . it was quite a revelation .  elvis remains one of the top ten made  for  tv movies of all time .  ,1
i saw this film on true movies  which automatically made me sceptical  but actually  it was good . why  not because of the amazing plot twists or breathtaking dialogue  of which there is little  but because actually  despite what people say i thought the film was accurate in it  s depiction of teenagers dealing with pregnancy .  br    br   it  s not dawson  s creek  they  re not graceful  cool witty characters who breeze through sexuality with effortless knowledge . they  re kids and they act like kids would .  br    br   they  re blunt  awkward and annoyingly confused about everything . yes  this could be by accident and they could just be bad actors but i don  t think so . dermot mulroney gives  when not trying to be cool  a very believable performance and i loved him for it . patricia arquette is whiny and annoying  but she was pregnant and a teenagers  the combination of the two isn  t exactly lavender on your pillow . the plot was very predictable and but so what  i believed them  his stress and inability to cope  her brave  yet slightly misguided attempts to bring them closer together . i think the characters  acted by anyone else  would indeed have been annoying and unbelievable but they weren  t . it reflects the surreality of the situation they  re in  that he  s sitting in class and she walks on campus with the baby . i felt angry at her for that  i felt angry at him for being such a child and for blaming her . i felt it all .  br    br   in the end  i loved it and would recommend it .  br    br   watch out for the scene where dermot mulroney runs from the disastrous counselling session  career performance .  ,1
i think it was ebert who gave stella four out of four stars but  other than his  i have never read a positive review of this sadly misunderstood drama about class divisions  love  and sacrifice  three themes most great romantic stories or films have in common  .  br    br   here the major theme is class division . stella is a story from depression era america . that said  it was translated to the screen then in such a memorable fashion that this remake  if you ask a stanwyck fan or two  was not exactly appreciated . fans of the original never gave it a chance . furthermore  this version of stella was made in the     s  not exactly a time of great financial trouble in america  as the depression was  .  br    br   now is the time to remove the rosy  coloured glasses  in the midst of a new era of recession and poverty in america  and see that this powerful story still rings true  is as timely and relevant as ever  in its updated format .  br    br   yes  class divide is the major theme here . stella is among the working poor  single  with big dreams but little hope of realizing those dreams . she works in a bar  doesn  t have much money  lives in a crummy apartment . you get the drift . in the morning  she doesn  t really want to get out of bed . on her wall  pictures of movie stars she idolizes .  br    br   a man sees her dance at the bar . he  s wealthy  educated  from one of those upper class families that has nothing in common with stella  s . his major concern is what ivy league college to attend  her  s is how to pay the rent  how to be  happy .  they have an affair . they like each other . stella ends up pregnant . stella tells the guy the news . his response   how about an abortion   she replies   i just wanted a room full of balloons .  he supplies the balloons  and the proposal  but she sees his heart is not in it  and has too much pride to accept . she sends him packing .  br    br   her daughter is eventually torn between the two lifestyles   the love she has for her mom and the advantages and happiness and love held out to her by her wealthy father . stella  alone and unloved  and not wanting her daughter to become as unhappy as her someday  makes the ultimate sacrifice . she gives up the only love and happiness she has ever known to ensure the happiness of her daughter  and perhaps live vicariously  and with hope  knowing that at least her daughter found something to live for .  br    br   now  for the movie . everything is right about it . beautiful score  artful cinematography  great set design  contrast between the two lifestyles the messy apt . and the decorated mansions   wonderful and heartfelt performances by the whole cast  with bette midler  in particular  oscar  worthy .  br    br   this is a film which is much more significant and well  made than you  ve been led to believe .  ,1
this film centers on four criminals  locked away in a prison who desire escape from their cell  hoping that a mysterious book of black magic  penned by a former inmate around      named danvers who wanted to use spells to keep his skin young .  br    br   carrre  s  grald laroche  criminal business tactics  shortcuts  have landed him in prison with three oddball cell  mates . . a transsexual brute marcus  clovis cornillac   marcus  love  toy pquerette  dimitri rataud  who eats objects he touches  . . and is in prison for eating his six  month old sister  and obeys his charge as if  he  were his mother  and the scholarly lassalle  philippe laudenbach  who doesn  t read  or eat breakfast  . . the latter being that he murdered his wife during that time of the day  . the film follows carrre as he reads from the book  attempting to understand it  s meanings hoping to find an exit from his prison . carrre loves his child  and for a while believes his wife will get him out early on bail . when she betrays him  carrre begins to slowly seethe with hate  and longing to see and hold his beloved son . carrre  s toughest critic is marcus  who longs to be fully female  while still folding to several masculine traits  such as working out and taking a leak standing up . he talks tough and uses his muscle as a type of fear tactic  although deep inside is a world of vulnerability . pquerette is completely under marcus  control and behaves like a canine to it  s master . . there  s even an alarming scene where pquerette breast  feeds from marcus  lassalle is an unraveling mystery  opening up for us to slowly understand his ulterior motives and what lies within his possibly sinister brain . clearly intellectual  and holding possible secrets from the others  lassalle is actually the one who keeps the motivation of pursuing the secrets of the book going . soon  those who aren  t a threat to the book seek their  true  escape  not as much from the cell of four walls  but the cell that imprisons their true desires . after a certain murder  the book is thrown from the room with a very fascinating character entering the film with a camcorder as if he were a new occupant . . who is this person and how does he understand the power of a book tosses away  and better yet  how to use it  a constant in this film is each of the prisoners often seen throughout looking out their window into the world just out of reach .  br    br   i  m glad i had a chance to watch this film . it does play out like  monkey  s paw   the characters get what they desire  but a price must be met . there  s gore in the film  startling moments of graphic violence  but  in my opinion  this is first and foremost a story  driven tale . the gore is a product of what the book unleashes . one of the group gets his limbs twisted while suspended in the air  while a grisly opening act displays the carnage left in the wake of one man  s desire . we see danver  s fate at the end  with a magnificent special effects sequence regarding an infant melting away . lassalle  s fate is a masterful effects sequence . i will say that malfique  through eric valette  s well paced direction  always kept my attention  and  for being such an isolated movie  . . about    of the film takes place in a singular location  the prison cell  it never seems to drag . i guess that  s a testament to interesting actors and fascinating characterizations  not to mention a compelling story using the supernatural to drive them .  ,1
i watched  entranced and mesmerized  by the vocal and physical acting . the roles each character played were done with excellence . the lyrics  the words  every gesture  the sunrise  told it all . the movie spoke to me . it enlightened me to a different perception of a person who believes in mankind . who believes in peace and gentle behavior . i was also held in disbelieve  by the sacrifices and human dignity was portrayed . power without grace  is demented and without feelings . to want power at the cost of mankind  is so unbelievable . this movie made me so afraid for the people who are no longer in this world . and  it is with sadness that i think of them . i like this movie for the conversations and face expressions to it all . may this movie be blessed .  ,1
  power play  starts off interesting but it goes down hill fast . the only good actor is tobin bell and he has a very small part . beyond bell   power play  has no redeeming value or interest .  power play  has more earthquakes in a few days than california has in a year . the earthquake scene in the mall is so contrived and completely unbelievable . and all the action scenes look like a bunch of third graders putting on a play . it  s awful  simply awful .  br    br   bottom line  if  power play  was made in the    s or    s it would be considered a poor  b  class movie . the fact that  power play  was made in     is really sad . is there such a thing as a  d  class movie  if so   power play  casts the mold .  ,0
this is a terrible remake of a marginal  but well liked  movie from the early    s . i have seen the original at least  times . the     version is a   minute movie  crammed  into  hours or whatever the runtime is . cheesy storyline  which by the way  is completely different than the original . the major government involvement was far  fetched . there is no flow from one scene to the next . in the original you could go get a beer or hit the bathroom and still keep up .  br    br   it only took a few hours movie time to change the oil pan on the car . it takes many times longer than that in real life . car guys notice this stuff . also  the fool or fools that chose to trash a     charger and abuse a     challenger should be shot in the heel with a dull bullet . the fact they aren  t  car people  is painfully obvious  and their passing will not be grieved .  br    br   the actors lacked any emotion  everything was cut and dried . one step above a monotone . a barmitzvah is more exciting and energetic .  br    br   last but surely not least  the radio dj made the statement that the challenger hit the bulldozers at    or        . that is total garbage . can you say aerodynamics  or lack thereof   hahahaha   this movie is a joke . don  t waste your time watching this one .  ,0
fear of a black hat is a hilarious spoof of hip  hop culture . it is just as funny as this is spinal tap  if not funnier . the actors are incredible and the documentary style is superb . mark christopher lawrence is a tremendous talent that should be starring in a lot more films . this film is a true cult classic   ,1
where was this film when i was a kid  after his parents split up tadashi moves with his mom to live his his grandfather . tadashi  s sister stays with their dad and they talk frequently on the phone . grandfather is only  here  every third day . moms never really home . the kids always are picking on the poor kid . during a village festival tadashi is chosen the  kirin rider  or spiritual champion of the peace and justice . little does he suspect that soon he will have to actually step into role of hero as the forces of darkness join up with the rage of things discarded in a plot to destroy mankind and the spiritual world .  br    br   okay that was the easy part . now comes the hard part  trying to explain the film .  br    br   this is a great kids film . no this is a great film  flawed   very flawed   but a great film none the less . it unfolds like all of those great books you loved as a kid and is just as dense at times as tadashi struggles to find the strength to become a hero . watching it i felt i was reading a great book  and thought how huge this would have been if it was a book . i loved that the film does not follow a normal path . things often happen out of happenstance or through miscommunication  one character gets sucked into events simply because his foot falls asleep . there are twists and turns and moments that seem like non sequiters and are all the more charming for it  which is typical miike  certainly its a takashi miike film . that japanese master of film is clearly in charge of a film that often touching  scary and funny all at the same time . no one except miike seems to understand that you can have many emotions at the same time  or that you can suddenly have twists as things get dark one second and then funny the next . i admire the fact that miike has made a film that is bleak and hopeful  that doesn  t shy away from being scary  i mean really scary  especially for kids . this is the same dark territory that should be in the harry potter movies but rarely is . this a dark grimms tale with humor . my first reaction upon seeing the opening image was that i couldn  t believe anyone would begin a kids film with a picture of the end of the world  then i realized who was making the movie . hats off to miike for making a movie that knows kids can handle the frightening images .  br    br   its also operating on more than one level . the mechanical monsters that the bad guys make are forged from mankind  s discarded junk . its the rage of being thrown away that fuels the monsters . one of the yokai  spirits  talks about the rage sneakers thrown away because they are dirty or too small feels when they are tossed . you also have one of the good guys refusing to join the bad guys because that would be the human thing to do . its a wild concept  but like other things floating around its what lifts this movie to another level .  there are a good many riffs and references to other movies  tv shows and novels that make me wonder who this film is for since kids may not understand them  though many parents will  and of course there are the monsters . they run the gamut from cheesy to spectacular with stops everywhere in between . frankly you have to forgive the unevenness of their creation simply because they are has to be hundreds if not thousands of monsters on screen . its way cool and it works . one of the main characters is a yokai which i think is best described as a hamster in a tunic and is often played by a stuffed animal  it looks dumb and yet you will be cheering the little bugger and loving every moment he rides on tadashi  s head .  acceptance is also easier if you  ve ever seen the old woodcuts of the weird japanese monsters  i mentioned flaws  and there are a few . the effects are uneven  some of the sudden turns are a bit odd  even if understandable  and a few other minor things which are fading now some two hours after watching the film . . none of them truly hurt the film over all  however most kind of keep you from being completely happy with the movie .  br    br   i really loved this movie . i  m pretty sure that if i saw this as a kid it would have been my favorite film of all time .  where  s the english dub   . see this movie . its a great trip .  besides its a good introduction to the films of miike minus the blood and graphic sex   ,1
